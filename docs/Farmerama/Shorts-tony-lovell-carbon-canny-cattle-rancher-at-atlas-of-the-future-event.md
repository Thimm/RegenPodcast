**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, how is everyone? Very good. So we've had very flash technology, we've had flash  
**[0:00:10-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:00:10):**  videos and we've had block chains and all these sorts of things and now we're going  
**[0:00:13-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:00:13):**  to have cows and grass just to ease us in at the end of the day. That's my two grandsons,  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:00:24):**  they're now five months of age. That photo was taken about 10 seconds after they've had  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:00:30):**  their first ever taste of solid food. So something new, something interesting, something different.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:00:36):**  Arden's a little fella over there and as you can see his approach to it is to think it  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:00:41):**  through to try to make sense of it. This is a bit different, I'm not sure what's happened  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:00:44):**  here but he's working his way through it. Quinny's brother's gone with this basic simple,  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:00:49):**  whoa, what was that? Hopefully sometime over the next 10 or 12 minutes you're going to  
**[0:00:54-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:00:54):**  get both of those reactions. Alright, what I want to talk to you about is climate change  
**[0:01:02-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:01:02):**  and the human induced climate change. Just looking at the brochure for this conference,  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:01:08):**  the presentation that's downstairs, what they're talking about is the impact of humanity on  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:01:13):**  the climate over the last 200 years. We've spoken about fossil fuels, we've spoken about  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:01:17):**  coal and oil and carbon dioxide that comes from that. What I'd like to do is get you  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:01:22):**  to just stretch that human impact on climate a little bit longer than 200 years and take  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:01:27):**  it back about another 10,000. The point at which we actually started to domesticate livestock,  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:01:31):**  the point at which we started to do agriculture. That's when we started to impact the climate  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:01:36):**  very heavily. Now what I'd like you to do at this point is simply turn to the people  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:01:40):**  either side of you, smile and say hello because you're going to need their help shortly so  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:01:44):**  everyone just turn to each other, say smile and say hello. Come on, pay attention, do  
**[0:01:49-0:01:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:01:49):**  this. Alright, very good, thank you. Okay, what's happened here? This is a photograph.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:01:56):**  What is it? It's a photograph of a wheat field in Australia. The photograph was taken on  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:02:01):**  a single day. It's not photoshopped. It's all one variety of wheat. It was planted on  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:02:06):**  the same day by the same farmer sitting in the same tractor. It's during a dry period,  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:02:11):**  it's during what in Australia is known as a drought. As you can see, some of the plants  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:02:14):**  in this photo didn't get the email about it being a drought. There's one long line of  
**[0:02:19-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:02:19):**  really bright, strong, healthy dark green plants in that. What caused that? What do  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:02:25):**  you think caused that? You've now got 10 or 15 seconds to talk to each other and come  
**[0:02:29-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:02:29):**  up with your reasons that that dark green line is there. Okay, go. Okay, thank you.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:02:42):**  That's enough. That's enough conversation for now, thank you. Okay, alright, now what  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:02:46):**  we're talking about is beef and producing a thing called beef. I was in the States recently  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:02:51):**  and I just had, on two different days, two days following each other, I just went past  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:02:54):**  two processes of producing beef. All I want you to do is have a look at them and we just  
**[0:02:59-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:02:59):**  go... where do we... okay, so look at this one. This is one way to produce beef. It's  
**[0:03:09-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:03:09):**  obviously a feedlot. There's something like 100 to 150,000 cattle in there and it keeps  
**[0:03:15-0:03:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:03:15):**  going and it keeps going and it keeps going. Alright, this is another way to produce beef.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:03:30):**  There's a good friend of ours called Dale Lassiter who unfortunately died two years  
**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:03:36):**  ago but with his cattle on the plains in Colorado. Alright, so the question for you is really  
**[0:03:43-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:03:43):**  simple. Did you spot any difference between the two ways to produce beef? Okay, if you  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:03:50):**  did, what was the main difference between the two ways that beef is being produced?  
**[0:03:55-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:03:55):**  What's the difference between beef being produced here and the beef that's produced here? Okay,  
**[0:04:04-0:04:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:04:04):**  the main reason is decisions made by human beings. Okay, cows are cows, sheep are sheep.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:04:12):**  They're neither good nor bad. They're just an animal. They didn't put themselves in there.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:04:18):**  The razor wire is not to stop them jumping in. So what you've got is we as human beings  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:04:25):**  decided to do that or we as human beings decided to do that. That's the fundamental difference.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:04:30):**  So don't blame the animal for something that we made it do. Alright, where is that? Where  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:04:41):**  is that on the planet? Lots of places it could be. Where's that? Lots of places it could  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:04:46):**  be. Where's that? Again, lots of places it could be. Okay, the top one is a property  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:04:52):**  in the Sonoran Desert in Mexico. The middle one is Date Creek in Arizona and the bottom  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:04:56):**  one is a riverbed in Zimbabwe in southern Africa. Okay, why do they look like that?  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:05:03):**  Well because of the climatic conditions, Tony. I mean the things, it's a Sonoran Desert.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:05:06):**  It's called the desert. Okay, it looks like that because it's a desert. That's why it's  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:05:11):**  like that. Okay, the interesting thing is that that's the property next door on the  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:05:17):**  same day. That's further down the same creek on the same day. That person there is that  
**[0:05:23-0:05:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:05:23):**  person there. Okay, and that's the riverbed on the adjoining property on the same day.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:05:31):**  That's in the Sonoran Desert in Mexico. That's in Arizona. That's in southern Africa. It's  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:05:38):**  the same areas on the same rainfall, the same soils, the same plant species, the same season.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:05:43):**  The pictures were genuinely taken on the same day. This area has more livestock. It's got  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:05:49):**  more wildlife. It's got more everything. The difference between that and that is how the  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:05:53):**  livestock are managed. Again, decisions that human beings make. We can either have that  
**[0:05:58-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:05:58):**  or we can have that depending on how we manage. All right. In nature, carbon, carbon dioxide,  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:06:07):**  okay, so this is the other half of the story. Half of the excess carbon dioxide that's in  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:06:11):**  the atmosphere is from burning fossil fuels. There's no doubt about that. The first half  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:06:16):**  that went up there came from the way that we managed our ecosystem. Okay, so everyone  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:06:21):**  understands about photosynthesis and how plants grow and they take carbon dioxide out of the  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:06:25):**  air and they build their plant material, et cetera. Okay, so if you think about the biggest  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:06:29):**  tree you've ever seen, okay, it's a couple of hundred feet tall and it's meters wide  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:06:34):**  and it weighs tons. Okay, and it's big and it's heavy and it's made of stuff. Where did  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:06:39):**  all the stuff in the tree come from? It started off as a tiny seed that big and it's now a  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:06:43):**  tree as big as this room. Okay, where did all the material, all the hard stuff in the  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:06:48):**  tree, where did it come from? People think it came out of the ground. Most of that is  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:06:52):**  solidified carbon dioxide. Okay, the bulk of that tree has actually come out of the  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:06:58):**  atmosphere by the process of nature, by photosynthesis. What people don't appreciate also is that  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:07:04):**  grasses do that. So the grasslands of our planet have got the same sort of capacity.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:07:07):**  A plant is a plant. It's still absorbing carbon dioxide. Question for you. You've seen grasses  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:07:13):**  growing in a paddock. You've seen grasses in somebody's yard. The grass might be this  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:07:17):**  high above ground. How deep are the roots of a grass plant? How far underground can  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:07:21):**  grass plants' roots go? Dirty centimetres, half a metre. How far do we think they can  
**[0:07:28-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:07:28):**  go? Okay. That is the roots on a grass plant. With a tree, about half of the mass you see  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:07:39):**  is above ground and half is below ground. With a grass plant, a healthy functioning  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:07:43):**  grass plant, 90 per cent of the action is happening underground. We don't see that.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:07:48):**  The interesting thing here is that's a wheat plant and you can see there's very little  
**[0:07:52-0:07:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:07:52):**  root activity. Perennial grass plant all the way down here. All of that plant material  
**[0:07:59-0:08:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:07:59):**  is basically carbon dioxide. Okay. Some material from the United States on prairies and biodiversity  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:08:07):**  and the diversity of different grass plants you've got. The plants are all about a metre  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:08:10):**  tall but the roots are going down five metres. Okay. Other than over here, which is a tiny  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:08:16):**  little grass in somebody's yard or in a paddock where cows are constantly keeping the grass  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:08:20):**  short. We've got a choice. We either have that or we have that. Okay. Now, if that was  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:08:32):**  one choice and that was another choice, if we've taken a huge part of the planet from  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:08:36):**  that to that, how much carbon dioxide has been released? How much reduction in water  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:08:42):**  holding capacity? How much hotter is that in summer than that? This is all the climate  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:08:47):**  impacts that are out there. Okay. This is the thing that gives me an incredible amount  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:08:51):**  of hope because we've got five billion hectares on this planet of seasonally dry grassland.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:08:57):**  Our planet is basically the two coal bits at the top and the bottom, a big green bit  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:09:01):**  through the middle and then grasslands. There's five billion hectares of grasslands. The thing  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:09:08):**  is that if we know that we can take it from that to that times five billion hectares,  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:09:15):**  you're making an enormous difference to the climate. You're making an enormous difference  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:09:18):**  to every aspect of the ecosystem. Okay. If you can do that in a way that's positive,  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:09:23):**  okay, financially, economically, socially and ecologically, how do we do that? What's  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:09:28):**  our process? We make nature. We look at what nature's doing and we bring that back into  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:09:35):**  our process. We recognise that there's a natural relationship between grasses and grazing animals.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:09:40):**  They evolve together. Okay. We recognise that, we respect it and we restore that relationship.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:09:46):**  Probably one of the few places on the planet where there's still a healthy functioning  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:09:49):**  grassland ecosystem is the Serengeti in Africa. If you've seen a documentary, a Discovery  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:09:54):**  Channel David Attenborough type documentary of the wildebeest migration, at some point  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:09:58):**  they'll do this. They'll do the helicopter photo and they'll pull back and they'll show  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:10:01):**  you the wildebeest migrating and you'll see three things that are critical for healthy  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:10:06):**  functioning of a grassland ecosystem. The first thing you'll see is a massive number  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:10:10):**  of animals altogether. Okay. The second thing you'll see is that there's no ecosystem on  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:10:14):**  earth that's productive enough to hold that for long. So the animals are constantly moving.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:10:19):**  The third thing you'll see is that those animals are kept bunched up because around the edge  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:10:22):**  of the herd are things trying to eat them and in the water holes are things trying to  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:10:25):**  eat them. So you have a big mob of animals come into an area for a short period of time.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:10:30):**  They graze non-selectively, they dung they impact and they move on. Okay. That's what  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:10:35):**  nature wants. What have we done? And it's not just the last 200 years, it's the last  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:10:39):**  10,000 years. What we do is we get lots of little herds, we put them in small areas and  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:10:46):**  we leave them for the whole year. So unintentionally, because a lot of these things as we've spoken  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:10:50):**  about is unintentional, unintentionally we've done exactly the opposite. Nature wants a  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:10:53):**  big herd constantly moving kept bunched up. We've created lots of little herds all spread  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:10:58):**  out stuck there for a long time. We change that process, we get a different result. Wildebeest  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:11:03):**  on the Serengeti. Okay. You look at that, look at that behaviour, look at what the animals  
**[0:11:07-0:11:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:11:07):**  are doing. Cattle on our country. Okay. We've basically got, we just leave the lions and  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:11:14):**  the crocodiles and stuff out of it. So we do it with horses and motorbikes and moving  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:11:19):**  the animals. But you've got exactly the same sort of behaviour. Okay. And we move the animals,  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:11:24):**  we bunch them up, we do what nature wants. Okay. So we come back to that, what happened  
**[0:11:29-0:11:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:11:29):**  here? Okay. So we hadn't forgotten that question. All right. A lot of stuff that we've seen,  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:11:37):**  we saw that there's grasses above ground and then we've got roots that go five metres deep.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:11:40):**  Okay. So there's a massive amount of things happening below ground. We've gone before,  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:11:45):**  we're all sitting in here and we've decided we wanted to get a cup of coffee or we wanted  
**[0:11:49-0:11:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:11:49):**  to go and get lunch. So we've got up and we walk down the stairs and we've gone down,  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:11:52):**  we've got our food and we come back up. Okay. A plant can't do that. A plant's got really  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:11:57):**  limited possibilities because where it grows is it. Okay. Now, if I wanted to pass something  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:12:03):**  from here and get it up to the back and nobody was allowed to get out of their seat, the  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:12:07):**  only way you can do it is you've got to cooperate. You've got to work together, you've got to  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:12:11):**  share the thing as you get there. Okay. Somewhere up the top here is a pine tree, seedling,  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:12:17):**  and then two plants either side. Most of what you can see on that underground is not the  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:12:23):**  plant, not the roots of the plant. Most of that, all that white material is a thing called  
**[0:12:27-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:12:27):**  a mycorrhizal fungi. It's a fungus that's symbiotic with the plant. Okay. The plant  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:12:33):**  takes all the carbon dioxide out of the air, produces carbohydrates and pushes that out  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:12:37):**  through its roots and it feeds this plant, this fungus. In return for feeding the fungus,  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:12:44):**  the fungus goes off and gets some phosphorus from over here and some potassium from over  
**[0:12:48-0:12:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:12:48):**  here and some zinc from over here and brings it back to the plant. Okay. Why is that relevant?  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:12:56):**  That's a long straight line with some trees in the end of it. What actually happened?  
**[0:13:00-0:13:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:13:00):**  What happened was that that was, previously, two paddocks and along there was an old fence.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:13:07):**  Okay. All the farmer did that year was he gone and pulled the old fence out and he planted  
**[0:13:13-0:13:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:13:13):**  across the whole thing. This area here had been ploughed and farmed for 30 or 40 years.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:13:20):**  The process of ploughing and the process of artificial fertiliser and all that breaks  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:13:24):**  up all that fungus and breaks up all that biology underground. Okay. That's what had  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:13:29):**  happened here. That's what had happened here. The bit where he hadn't ploughed up still  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:13:33):**  had the microbial activity, it still had the biology. That's the only difference, is nature  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:13:39):**  underneath it. Okay. When you're talking about cattle, if you've got one thing to take away  
**[0:13:46-0:13:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:13:46):**  from here, you've got people talk about livestock. As I said, cows and sheep, goats, pigs, chickens  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:13:53):**  are just cows, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens. There's nothing inherently good or bad about  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:13:58):**  them. What we decide to do with them is what the consequences are. There's a huge difference  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:14:04):**  between livestock and properly managed livestock. Okay. So when somebody's talking to you about  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:14:09):**  livestock, just say you're talking about livestock, you're talking about properly managed livestock.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:14:13):**  You now understand part of the difference between it. Properly managed livestock can  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:14:17):**  restore the environment and rebalance the carbon cycle. Okay. If we change our management,  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:14:23):**  we can get those grass roots going down hugely. We can increase that whole process. Okay.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:14:27):**  The nature's preferred means of cycling carbon in a grassland. Everything is about cycling.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:14:32):**  In those ecosystems, if the grass don't get eaten, they burn. A fire is 3.6 times more  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:14:38):**  greenhouse gas intensive than a cow chewing the same amount of material. So we don't have  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:14:43):**  a choice of nothing happening. We take the cattle out, it still rains, the grass still  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:14:47):**  grows. At some point, nature wants to cycle it. Okay. It's either the animal eating it  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:14:52):**  or a fire. They're efficient producers of food from non-edible resources. Now, Richard  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:14:58):**  said a lot of the production goes into feeding cattle. We grow soybeans, we grow corn. We  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:15:03):**  decide to do that. We put the cows in a feedlot. If we had the cattle out on grasslands and  
**[0:15:08-0:15:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:15:08):**  managed properly, we can get a massive amount or more production out of it. Okay. So I'll  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:15:15):**  leave you with the thought that at the end of the day, it comes back to your choice.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:15:18):**  Now we've had a whole conversation around from starting with Kate with what's the future  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:15:22):**  going to be? And we've had Bitcoin, we've had all these bits and pieces, and we've had  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:15:26):**  what the capitalist system should be and where we should move to, et cetera, et cetera. What  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:15:30):**  it still comes back to is the cleanest signal we've got is where we spend our time and where  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:15:34):**  we spend our money. Okay. We spend our time in advocating for things, in activating for  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:15:40):**  things, in volunteering for things, in being involved and coming to conferences like this.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:15:46):**  How we spend our money is a big thing. Okay. And every time you shop, every time you buy  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:15:51):**  something, you are sending a really clear signal to society as to which direction you  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:15:54):**  want them to head. Okay. So hopefully, as I said, the takeaway is there's a huge difference  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:15:59):**  between livestock and properly managed livestock, and don't blame the animals for something  
**[0:16:02-0:16:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-tony-lovell#t=0:16:02):**  that we've done. Thank you.

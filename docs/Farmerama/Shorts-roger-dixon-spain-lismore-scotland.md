**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to this Farmerama short, featuring an extended interview with Lismore-based farmer  
**[0:00:10-0:00:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:00:10):**  and holistic land manager Roger Dixon-Spain.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:00:29):**  Do you want my surname as well?  
**[0:00:31-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:00:31):**  Yes.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:00:32):**  Roger Dixon-Spain, 74 years old.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:00:35):**  I spent the whole life in farming, actually came to Scotland thinking that I was never  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:00:42):**  going to farm again, that was 16 years ago.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:00:45):**  I used to farm 1500 acres of alluvial silt down in Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire, actually  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:00:52):**  it's a mixture of alluvial silt and there was some peat, blackish soil, which was actually  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:00:58):**  fast disappearing.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:01:00):**  Industrial farming, I wouldn't have called it that a few years ago, but I now realise  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:01:05):**  that although I was very good at the job that I did, I got to the top of the ladder and  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:01:11):**  then found out that it was against the wrong wall.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:01:13):**  I suppose I'd never wanted to farm in the first place, I was one of these young men  
**[0:01:17-0:01:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:01:17):**  who was expected to farm by their family and fell into line and did as I was told, and  
**[0:01:24-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:01:24):**  was not enjoying farming at all.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:01:27):**  We wound up on Lismore because of a botched holiday booking.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:01:32):**  Gillie and I had had some pretty horrid stuff happen to us.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:01:37):**  We decided that we were going to spend the rest of our lives adventuring, doing all the  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:01:41):**  things that we'd either never had time to do, or the things we hadn't dared do.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:01:46):**  So we raced on motorbikes, we flew aeroplanes, we rock climbed, we did all sorts of crazy  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:01:52):**  stuff.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:01:53):**  And one of the things I wanted Gillie to try was sailing, and so we booked ourselves on  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:01:57):**  a charter boat.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:01:59):**  About two weeks before we were due to join this boat, they rang us up and said, we've  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:03):**  had a bit of an accident with the boat, we don't want to leave UK waters, so we're not  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:07):**  going down the west coast of France, we're going to the west coast of Scotland.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:10):**  I went, oh.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:12):**  And Gillie said, oh for goodness sake, it's just sailing.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:15):**  And so we came to Scotland.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:16):**  That was end of August, beginning of September 2001, and we were living in Scotland by the  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:23):**  6th of January the following year.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:25):**  Do you want to just tell me where we are now?  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:28):**  Well we're on the island of Lismore.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:30):**  This property fell into our laps as a result of having to go and see a solicitor about  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:35):**  something completely unrelated in Oban.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:38):**  Telephone rang and the solicitor, having talked to this person on the phone, said, think I've  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:44):**  found your house.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:45):**  I said, pardon?  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:46):**  He said, I think I've found your house.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:47):**  That was a woman who wants to sell a place on Lismore.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:51):**  I said, where's that?  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:53):**  He said, trust me, you need to go and have a look.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:55):**  This is just absolutely gorgeous.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:02:57):**  So the next day we came out here.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:03:00):**  We arrived at 11.30 and by 1.30 the deal was done.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:03:04):**  So Lismore was an accident, Scotland was an accident, and maybe we were, as they say,  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:03:11):**  being led to what we're doing now.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:03:14):**  I had no intention of farming, but this house just happened to have 74 acres attached to  
**[0:03:19-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:03:19):**  it.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:03:20):**  So that's where it started and that was 16 years ago.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:03:25):**  Lismore sits in the middle of the seaward end of the Great Glen, about five miles northwest  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:03:31):**  of Oban.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:03:32):**  It sits like a ship in between two masses of mainland Scotland and it is one of the  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:03:39):**  only bits of limestone in Scotland.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:03:42):**  It is relatively speaking a lot more fertile than the land on the mainland either side  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:03:48):**  of us, but it's still marginal land.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:03:52):**  Most of the croft that we've got is rock and hill.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:03:56):**  Good productive soil is not what we've got here, however compared with the rest of Scotland  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:04:01):**  it's terrific.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:04:02):**  So can you tell me a bit about your approach on this 74 acres of marginal land and how  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:04:06):**  you came to be using that approach?  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:04:08):**  Yeah, well it started off, I think there's a crofting law which says if you don't use  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:04:13):**  your croft, your next door neighbour in crofting law is entitled to come and use it if you  
**[0:04:17-0:04:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:04:17):**  don't.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:04:18):**  So we got some grazing animals.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:04:20):**  I've never dealt with animals in my farming career because they were available on the  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:04:25):**  island.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:04:26):**  We bought these Highland cattle.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:04:27):**  We started off with three and we now have a small direct sales business which has been  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:04:34):**  going for, well I suppose 14 years now.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:04:37):**  And we're producing some really high quality, 100% grass fed beef and lamb.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:04:44):**  Ten years ago we were watching a film by Rebecca Hosking called A Farm for the Future.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:04:51):**  This film was extraordinary, 45 minutes and it took as long as it took to watch the film  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:04:57):**  to have my whole belief system completely reversed.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:05:01):**  At the end of the film I believed none of what I'd spent my whole life believing.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:05:06):**  I couldn't sleep for two or three days.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:05:08):**  I just completely turned me inside out and I suddenly realised that I'd spent my whole  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:05:13):**  working life doing the wrong stuff.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:05:16):**  I'd been into ploughing the whole of my life and I thought that was a necessary part of  
**[0:05:22-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:05:22):**  the business of growing food and managing land.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:05:25):**  So oh dear, huge shock.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:05:29):**  But we immediately got into the business of researching this whole deal in depth and we  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:05:36):**  have met some extraordinary people around the world on this journey.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:05:41):**  And I can now say that I'm a holistic land manager, I'm a regenerative farmer, I'm really  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:05:47):**  really excited about what we're doing here.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:05:50):**  It's earth shattering stuff, the realisation that as a species we've got it so horribly  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:05:54):**  wrong.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:05:56):**  We got into looking at holistic management because we watched Alan Saver's TED talk,  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:06:03):**  which I found totally inspiring.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:06:08):**  And he was saying that as a species we've always managed our lives in pretty much the  
**[0:06:13-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:06:13):**  same way for time immemorial.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:06:17):**  But we're always firefighting, we're always dealing with today's challenge, today's problem.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:06:24):**  But what we haven't ever realised is that there are always unintended consequences that  
**[0:06:29-0:06:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:06:29):**  flow from something that is dealt with in isolation rather than in the round.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:06:37):**  The whole of what you're dealing with has to be considered in whatever situation you  
**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:06:42):**  find yourself in.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:06:43):**  And Alan's always saying that if the universe is a piece of string and you pull the string,  
**[0:06:51-0:06:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:06:51):**  everything moves.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:06:53):**  The H word actually has some connotations with people, which means long hair and sandals  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:06:59):**  and flowers in your hair, but it's not that at all.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:07:03):**  What does it mean in practice?  
**[0:07:05-0:07:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:07:05):**  I think it's the depth of the thinking that goes into absolutely everything that we do  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:07:13):**  now.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:07:15):**  Everything that we do here is contextual.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:07:17):**  So when we're making decisions here now, every decision that we make, whether it's our personal  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:07:22):**  life, whether it's to do with the farm, the croft, whether it's to do with the lives of  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:07:28):**  our children, all the challenges that we meet and the decisions we have to make have to  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:07:34):**  be filtered through that settled, holistic context.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:07:39):**  Alan Savery has put together a decision-making framework.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:07:44):**  Every decision is put through seven testing questions, but the whole thing is really filtered  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:07:49):**  through this holistic context that we spent months and months and months writing down  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:07:56):**  on paper.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:07:57):**  So really, really thoughtfully designed view of where we're headed.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:08:06):**  And we're not talking five, 10 years from now, we're talking 50, 100, 150 years from  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:08:11):**  now.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:08:12):**  So that we're dealing with land and with a business that will benefit people down the  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:08:18):**  generations in perpetuity if we get it right.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:08:22):**  So what does that look like in terms of the mob grazing and the paddocks and the livestock  
**[0:08:27-0:08:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:08:27):**  you've got?  
**[0:08:28-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:08:28):**  I know that mob grazing is a popular term for the way in which we are now starting to  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:08:36):**  think about grazing animals.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:08:38):**  I would like to use the term holistic planned grazing, because the holistic planned grazing  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:08:44):**  takes into account the environmental, social and economic aspects of what we're trying  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:08:51):**  to do.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:08:53):**  And so we're not just moving animals from one paddock to another.  
**[0:08:57-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:08:57):**  This is a choreographed dance.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:08:59):**  I think probably we run our lives here on observation a lot.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:05):**  You know, how do I know when to move cattle?  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:07):**  Feel.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:08):**  I mean, it's just looking.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:10):**  You go and put the cattle and sheep into a paddock, which is defined by electric fences  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:15):**  so you can help whatever size you like.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:18):**  You put them into a paddock.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:19):**  You observe what happens for 24 hours and then you make up your mind, oh, it was a little  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:26):**  bit small or it was a little bit big or and you adjust the size and you just adjust it  
**[0:09:31-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:31):**  on a daily basis.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:32):**  You know, you might move the animals after 24 hours.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:36):**  You might move them off to 12 hours.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:37):**  You might leave them for 36 hours, maybe 48 hours, but definitely not any longer than  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:42):**  three days.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:43):**  When the grass is growing fast, you move them fast.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:46):**  When the grass is growing slow, you move them slow.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:49):**  I didn't understand what overgrazing meant.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:51):**  I thought that was too many animals on a piece of ground.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:55):**  It's not.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:09:56):**  The definition of overgrazing is that the forage is exposed to animals for overly long  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:10:03):**  periods.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:10:04):**  So when you get the spring flush, you've got regrowth within 24 hours.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:10:08):**  You don't want animals grazing the regrowth.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:10:10):**  So that's why you move them quickly.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:10:13):**  And a measure of what's been happening to us here, we have 90 virtual paddocks.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:10:21):**  In the first year we did mob grazing, we only managed to graze each paddock once.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:10:26):**  This last year, we grazed most of them three times, some of them four.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:10:30):**  And we got more animals.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:10:32):**  So we are producing a lot more grass.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:10:35):**  And we don't know what we're going to see in the next two or three years.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:10:39):**  I am led to believe there is a latent seed bank of plants that haven't germinated, seeds  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:10:45):**  that haven't germinated for maybe 100 years, 150 years.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:10:50):**  I'm led to believe by my peers and the people who know more than I do, that when conditions  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:10:56):**  are right, it'll all come.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:10:58):**  And then you start to see diversity and all the wonderful things that you want to see.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:11:05):**  And dare to believe that you will see, but you think when?  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:11:11):**  And that's where you have to be patient and trust that you're doing the right stuff.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:11:17):**  And I think we are.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:11:18):**  You know, we see pastures being allowed to express themselves.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:11:23):**  You know, you don't see that in too many places.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:11:25):**  You don't see too much long grass.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:11:27):**  But you know, long grass makes sense from a photosynthesis point of view.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:11:30):**  You know, if we're going to maximize solar gain.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:11:33):**  You know, like, I don't know if I ever thought it, but, you know, there's that nuclear reactor  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:11:38):**  up in the sky and most people are disconnected from the knowledge or even the thought that  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:11:44):**  that's what everything runs on.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:11:47):**  So it has to be the answer.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:11:48):**  You know, it's like people bang on about technology.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:11:52):**  And yeah, it's really useful.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:11:54):**  You know, we live on the net because it's useful to communicate with people.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:11:59):**  And I'm sure that, you know, in my farming career, I saw lots and lots of wonderful,  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:12:03):**  supposedly wonderful things happen.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:12:06):**  But they're all, all the technology that we use is a human construct.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:12:10):**  And because it's a human construct, if it goes wrong, we can fix it.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:12:14):**  But when it comes to land management, water management, when it comes to human relationships,  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:12:21):**  when it comes to all those sort of things that aren't human constructs, then those are  
**[0:12:27-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:12:27):**  testament to our lack of understanding because we get it so horribly wrong a lot of the time.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:12:34):**  We live in a biological universe.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:12:37):**  So to my mind, it must be that the answers are probably going to be biological, not technological.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:12:45):**  The problem is that, you know, we're so invested in this system that we've got, you know, whether  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:12:51):**  it's growing commodities or whether it's transporting food, you know, we have a system which has  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:12:57):**  no resilience built into it at all.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:13:00):**  And I would say, simplify everything.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:13:04):**  Get to use and understand nature's chemistry set and use that.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:13:11):**  Don't use the technological stuff.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:13:13):**  Use what's there for free.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:13:15):**  You know, this photosynthesis, you know, it's like the mantra here is no bare ground anywhere.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:13:21):**  And boy, does it make a difference.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:13:26):**  If you go out into our pastures in the summer, you can't find the soil.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:13:31):**  It's just a mat of dead, dying, decomposing plant food.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:13:38):**  You can pass it and pass it and pass it and eventually you'll come to some soil.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:13:43):**  But if you try and penetrate that with a hoof, you can't.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:13:46):**  It's like a trampoline.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:13:49):**  We're squaring the circle.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:13:50):**  You know, it's like if you don't have animals, well, you know, all the stuff that's said  
**[0:13:54-0:14:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:13:54):**  about animals and much vilified livestock, they are part of this wonderful circular system.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:14:02):**  Birth, life, death, all the stuff that goes on in between.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:14:09):**  And you know, we're now living with that real time.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:14:14):**  And I think it's inspiring to do that.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:14:19):**  We are totally out of what used to be understood as agricultural practice.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:14:25):**  It's a completely different mindset.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:14:27):**  Because Alan Sabriel said, well, it's because you're thinking holistically about everything.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:14:33):**  So what are the changes you've seen on the farm since you started adopting this approach?  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:14:39):**  Since we started planned grazing, it started off by being mob grazing, I have to say.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:14:44):**  But I think we've seen our forage production triple out of the 74 acres.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:14:50):**  We've got about 20, 24 acres of grazing.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:14:55):**  We've got about the same of stockpile forage.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:14:59):**  In other words, grass that we let grow through the summer and then graze during the winter.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:15:05):**  And we have about the same of woodland and rough grazing and non-intervention areas.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:15:14):**  A lot of the croft is rock and rock and hill.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:15:18):**  We've got we've got heather.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:15:19):**  We've, you know, so some of it's a bit acid, but there's not a lot of what we call flat  
**[0:15:24-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:15:24):**  grazing ground.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:15:25):**  So how many livestock have you got?  
**[0:15:29-0:15:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:15:29):**  We've got 10 Highland cattle, 10 Texel, cross blackface hoggets.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:15:37):**  So in terms of livestock units, about 20 livestock units, something like that, because we have  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:15:43):**  our animals out all year round, they're not housed.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:15:47):**  The winter time is a bit of a problem if we've got too many feet on the ground because it  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:15:50):**  just make a horrible mess.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:15:51):**  So it's a balancing act between the amount of mess that animals will make on the land  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:15:56):**  during the winter, on top of which we recognise that the living that we would help other people  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:16:03):**  to make here is not going to be based on cattle and sheep.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:16:08):**  They're a management tool.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:16:10):**  They make a profit.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:16:11):**  But realistically, we're not going to be making enough money to support somebody's living  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:16:17):**  here if it's just cattle and sheep.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:16:19):**  So how do you make a living of 74 acres on an island in Scotland without having to rely  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:16:26):**  on subsidies and government handouts?  
**[0:16:30-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:16:30):**  That is the purpose of doing what we're doing because other than returning land soil to  
**[0:16:37-0:16:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:16:37):**  being healthy, learning to grow topsoil, learning to grow soil biology, sequestering carbon  
**[0:16:45-0:16:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:16:45):**  and being able to show people that we have the answer to climate change, we also want  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:16:51):**  to have the answer to rural communities being able to support themselves financially without  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:16:57):**  government help because we're all going to have to do that at some point.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:17:01):**  So if we can learn to do that, then we're going to be ahead of the curve and then we'll  
**[0:17:04-0:17:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:17:04):**  be able to teach other people to do the same.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:17:07):**  So how are you going to make a living from this other than from livestock?  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:17:12):**  It's likely to come from a mixture of the animals that we've got at the moment because  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:17:17):**  we supply our regular customers with meat and they've been continuously asking us for  
**[0:17:24-0:17:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:17:24):**  chicken.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:17:25):**  We're just building our first egg mobile.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:17:30):**  We've had hen houses on wheels, but we need to be following the cattle.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:17:35):**  So Alan Savery's wisdom, not his wisdom, but if you go out and observe nature and you look  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:17:41):**  at the Serengeti and you see a load of water buffalo, what's on their backs?  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:17:46):**  Egrets.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:17:47):**  You know, there are birds, there are birds everywhere.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:17:49):**  So pasture sanitizers and also, you know, food for laying hens and that sort of stuff.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:17:56):**  Julie and I have spent two and a half years getting ourselves to be qualified to slaughter  
**[0:18:02-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:18:02):**  chickens here and Julie on her own got legislation rewritten to allow us to do that, to allow  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:18:11):**  new people into the industry.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:18:14):**  We are the first new people in the chicken industry in Scotland since devolution.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:18:20):**  The profitability of it looks really good.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:18:23):**  We would be producing pasture raised chicken, pasture raised eggs and the rest of the income  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:18:30):**  would come from education and a tourism offer.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:18:34):**  And it could be either tourism in the sense that everybody knows tourism, in other words  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:18:38):**  people on holiday, or it's going to be the business of educating people into this new  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:18:45):**  way of looking at farming, land management and food production.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:18:49):**  A human health, animal health, the whole nine yards.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:18:53):**  Because once we start down this path, everything changes.  
**[0:18:58-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:18:58):**  Absolutely everything.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:18:59):**  My job, I guess in the future, and that of my wife Julie, will be helping to educate  
**[0:19:05-0:19:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:19:05):**  people to know how to do what we're doing here and what the benefits are, but also to  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:19:13):**  help young people to get into farming.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:19:16):**  People who have never been in farming before.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:19:19):**  Farmers are so invested in what they've learnt to do over a lifetime they're virtually impossible  
**[0:19:24-0:19:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:19:24):**  to persuade.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:19:25):**  So we're either looking for low hanging fruit, those people who know there needs to be a  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:19:29):**  change but don't know how, or young people who are open minded enough to just come in  
**[0:19:34-0:19:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:19:34):**  and learn how to look after the land that we rely on as our base asset as a species.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:19:42):**  Because if we muck that up, we're toast.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:19:55):**  Five years ago, we both simultaneously injured ourselves.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:20:00):**  So at that point, we started to realise that we were not getting the work done.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:20:06):**  And so we set about trying to find a young couple that would take over from us.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:20:10):**  We personally don't want to be doing the work.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:20:13):**  We want to hand that on to somebody else.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:20:15):**  We want to be responsible for getting the message out there, helping them to educate  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:20:20):**  themselves, being front men for people to visit here whilst they're learning their trade,  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:20:27):**  and just generally sort of enjoying the process because it's extraordinarily exciting.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:20:33):**  If you want to know about the power of recovery, you just have to look at what 16 years has  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:20:38):**  done us just extraordinary.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:20:41):**  So I think you know, our countryside is in for a renaissance big time.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:20:47):**  If we're going to sort the climate change thing out.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:20:51):**  What's going to make that change happen?  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:20:53):**  People like me, I guess.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:20:55):**  People like Richard Perkins, people like Gabe Brown, people like Alan Sabre, you know, he's  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:00):**  saying, look, take my stuff, interpret it and make it work in your particular geographical  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:05):**  climatic zone.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:07):**  Work it out.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:08):**  You've got the basics.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:09):**  That's what we're doing.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:18):**  If I was farming today, if I was farming in the fens, I'd have probably have eight, eight,  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:23):**  10,000 head of cattle.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:25):**  And my job would be to move them once or twice a day.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:31):**  That would be my job.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:32):**  And once I've done that, because once they're trained, you know, if you'd seen the cattle  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:36):**  moving this morning, they get really, really excited when they know they're going to be  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:40):**  moved.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:41):**  I mean, you think they're big, lugubrious animals and then they behave like school children  
**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:47):**  when you when you take them to a new pasture.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:50):**  So I would I would do that once or twice a day.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:53):**  I would have no chemical bill.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:55):**  I'd have no fertilizer bill.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:56):**  I'd have no machinery bill.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:21:58):**  I'd probably have not much of a labor bill.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:22:01):**  And once I'd moved my cattle, OK, so you have to put the infrastructure in to do it.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit#t=0:22:05):**  But once that was done, I moved the cattle once, twice a day and I'd spend the rest of

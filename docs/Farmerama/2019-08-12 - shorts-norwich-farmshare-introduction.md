## Shorts: Norwich Farmshare introduction  
**[0:00:00-0:00:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, my name is Joel Rodka. Last year I was setting up a market garden on a farm near  
**[0:00:17-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:00:17):**  Peterborough. I recorded various podcasts throughout the year, charting my journey in  
**[0:00:25-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:00:25):**  trying to establish a market garden and trying to make it successful. Unfortunately, that project  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:00:32):**  didn't work out for various reasons. There wasn't a particularly good relationship with the landlords.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:00:38):**  I had some problems with the growing conditions which I don't think were going to be resolved  
**[0:00:46-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:00:46):**  very quickly to do with the soil and the wind. There was no shelter on the site there. There  
**[0:00:56-0:01:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:00:56):**  were problems with the location because of its geography and relation to my family and also  
**[0:01:03-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:01:03):**  because of personal commitments. So that came to an end at the end of last year and I decided to  
**[0:01:12-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:01:12):**  leave there and move back to Norwich. Over the winter I got chatting to a friend of mine, Jack,  
**[0:01:18-0:01:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:01:18):**  who was working at Norwich Farm Share, which is a CSA just on the edge of Norwich. They were having  
**[0:01:25-0:01:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:01:25):**  some issues with finances and Jack was only doing one day a week over the winter. So we discussed  
**[0:01:35-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:01:35):**  the possibility of me joining Norwich Farm Share and both being the growers at Norwich Farm Share  
**[0:01:43-0:01:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:01:43):**  and that's what happened. So in March this year I joined Norwich Farm Share. I am doing two days a  
**[0:01:52-0:01:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:01:52):**  week and Jack is doing two days a week. We both work Thursdays which is a harvest day and we then  
**[0:01:59-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:01:59):**  work one other day. We also have a volunteer day which is also on the Thursday. So it's now August  
**[0:02:06-0:02:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:02:06):**  the 6th and I've been here for five months and it's going pretty well. There are lots of challenges  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:02:17):**  as they're on every farm and every new job but there's also lots of opportunities. It's got a  
**[0:02:23-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:02:23):**  lot of potential as a project and as a site. We've got about three acres of land which is gently  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:02:30):**  sloping and south-facing so the aspect is south-facing which means we've got sun all day.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:02:36):**  On the east, west and north side we've got big coniferous and deciduous trees which give us  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:02:44):**  great shelter but don't shade the site. So that's excellent. The soil is pretty good, it's quite  
**[0:02:50-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:02:50):**  sandy but it seems to have enough fertility and we haven't really noticed any problems with plant  
**[0:02:57-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:02:57):**  growth. Before I joined they had the whole site rabbit fenced and we're still dealing with rabbits  
**[0:03:06-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:03:06):**  which are using holes which we haven't found. I think we may have blocked up the last hole last  
**[0:03:13-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:03:13):**  week and hopefully we won't have any more rabbits inside the fence but they've been a bit of a  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:03:19):**  problem and we've had some problem with birds. So the fenced-in area is about three acres and  
**[0:03:26-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:03:26):**  we are probably cultivating about a quarter to half an acre. We have two big polytunnels which  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:03:34):**  Jack put up last year, a smaller propagation tunnel and a small salad area. We are growing  
**[0:03:40-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:03:40):**  on 30 inch or just over 80 centimeter wide beds with 40 centimeter paths at the moment. We are growing  
**[0:03:50-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:03:50):**  on 25 meter beds and we have six plots of nine beds and this week we have just filled every bed.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:04:00):**  The main weeds that we've got are nettles and buttercup and a few others and we're just about  
**[0:04:08-0:04:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:04:08):**  getting on top of them now. It's taken us the last couple of months to deal with them but they're now  
**[0:04:15-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:04:15):**  sort of under control. The site is pretty good really. As an organization we are mainly a  
**[0:04:26-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:04:26):**  membership organization selling weekly veg boxes to we now have just over 70 members. I think at  
**[0:04:34-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:04:34):**  its maximum a few years ago they had about 120 so we harvest on a Thursday take all the produce to  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:04:43):**  a collection point and then the members come and weigh out their produce and take it home. We're  
**[0:04:49-0:04:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:04:49):**  also starting to sell to restaurants. We don't think we've got enough members to fund ourselves  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:04:56):**  through the winter so we probably need about 90 to 100 members so that is overshadowing us a bit  
**[0:05:03-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:05:03):**  at the moment but we're confident that we can recruit more members and we're hoping that we  
**[0:05:13-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:05:13):**  can build on the really amazing success we've had already this year in terms of how much we've grown  
**[0:05:21-0:05:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:05:21):**  and just establishing systems, working in a partnership, getting new volunteers involved  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:05:28):**  and hopefully we'll have enough money to carry us through to next year and we can really start  
**[0:05:35-0:05:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:05:35):**  building on the foundations that were established over the last 12 months. I'll stop there. I will  
**[0:05:42-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:05:42):**  try and do regular updates. It's just been non-stop since we started working together in March so  
**[0:05:50-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:05:50):**  hopefully I will have a bit more time. I'm actually going away to Italy for a short break and then  
**[0:05:57-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:05:57):**  we'll be back for the autumn winter push so I will try and update on what we're doing on the farm,  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:06:04):**  what our plans are, what's working well, what isn't working well and how this kind of organization  
**[0:06:10-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:06:10):**  works and what are the pros and cons. So hopefully you'll tune in to the next episode. Thanks for  
**[0:06:17-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-norwich-farmshare-introduction#t=0:06:17):**  listening and see you next time. Bye!

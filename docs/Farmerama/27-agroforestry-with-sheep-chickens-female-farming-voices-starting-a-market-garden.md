This month we dip into the wonderful world of agroforestry.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:00:20):**  Abby has been in California and she reports from an event celebrating women's leadership  in farming.  Today we have the first in a series of reports from a young farmer who is setting up a new  
**[0:00:30-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:00:30):**  farm from the ground up.  Thank you Katie and hello to Abby who is with me in London.  Katie is in Glasgow.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:00:49):**  Hello.  To start, here are some voices from the first agroforestry conference in the UK.  The conference brought together farmers and foresters, two groups who, it turns out, rarely  
**[0:01:02-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:01:02):**  find themselves in the same room.  By mixing farming and forestry, a well-managed agroforestry system can produce as much as  40% more yield from the same plot of land than if you were growing the two crops independently.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:01:18):**  The Woodland Trust is one of the organisations leading the charge on farms in this area by  helping farmers to plant new native trees on their land.  John Tucker is head of Woodland Creation.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:01:29):**  Woodland Trust is a charity, I guess we're like the National Trust for Trees, so we're  an NGO.  We have a number of aspirations and one of them is to see more native trees and woods  
**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:01:41):**  in the landscape.  We were formed in 1972 and probably for the first 35 years of our existence we did our  own thing.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:01:50):**  We bought woodlands or we bought bare land and planted trees to create new woodland.  And about 10 years ago we realised if we really wanted to make a difference, that model just  wasn't going to work.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:02:00):**  So we had to find a way of working with existing landowners and help them make a difference  for us.  So our starting point is you've got to understand the objectives of that landowner, everybody's  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:02:14):**  objectives are going to be different and then it's up to us to come up with, you know, what  difference, how trees can make their objectives work and it will be different for all sorts  of different landowners.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:02:25):**  So we have a number of schemes depending on what people want to do, so if it's agroforestry  systems we have financial support through our core hotels, we can pay a certain number  of euros per tree for schemes that come in, so that's one way.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:02:41):**  We have a scheme that if people want to do slightly bigger areas, if they want to plant  say half a hectare of woodland, we have a scheme called Morewoods where we can cost  share through that scheme.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:02:54):**  If it's being planted with a contractor we can do all the design, we can organise all  the plants, we can organise the contract and then we'll split the cost 50-50 between us.  If the farmer wants to plant the trees themselves then we cost share, we pay 60%, the farmer  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:03:11):**  pays 40%.  So there are some good support mechanisms out there, there are lots of, you know, we  deal in various farm tree packs as well that people can apply for online.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:03:25):**  So my suggestion would be go to our website, there's a, you know, they can go on there,  there's a place you can contact us for more information, just come and talk to us.  From the day we heard from all types of farmers who'd benefited from the scheme, from potato  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:03:42):**  farmers to small mixed cow and grain farms.  Nicole and Paul Renison raise sheep and cows in the Pennines.  We chatted to them about their experience and how they ended up working with the Woodland  
**[0:03:54-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:03:54):**  Trust.  Hi, I'm Paul Renison, I'm with my wife, my good lady, Nick Renison and we farm on the  East Fellside near Penrith and we're predominantly sheep but we do have a dairy heifer rearing  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:04:09):**  enterprise and we're starting a small suckler herd.  The Woodland Trust have given us help with building tree boxes which they've planted,  they've built the tree boxes and they've planted them up.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:04:21):**  So we've got about three or four different tree species in each box.  We've probably got about 40 or 50 tree boxes around the farm and they've also just recently  helped with 200 metres of hedging on the entry up to the farm.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:04:38):**  Yes, our long term plan now is to keep planting, basically keep going with it because we're  seeing an economic advantage from doing it and keep going until we run out of space.  Well our farm is in the Pennines and it's bleak, there's lots of stone walls, hardly  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:05:01):**  any trees really, no hedges and so we've got these sheep and we've got to keep them alive  and we've got to produce lambs.  Shelter is a real problem so the hedges help with the shelter, the trees we've planted  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:05:15):**  in to create shelter belts, they help keep the lambs alive.  But also we'll be there for quite a few years and trees and hedges just make it a nicer  place to be and you don't really want to spend all your life living on a bleak, miserable  
**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:05:35):**  hill farm.  So hopefully it will help us make money and look prettier.  When we first started at this farm we were lambing indoors and we've soon come to a conclusion  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:05:49):**  that it's pretty labour intensive and we wanted to lamb everything outdoors.  So we've moved away from having fairly unproductive hill sheep towards a white-faced flock but  with that comes the fact that the lambs are probably slightly less hardy so we thought  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:06:09):**  well we're going to need to make some more shelter, more windbreaks and luckily Pete  Leeson turned up on the scene and given us an awful lot of help with planting our trees  and also his knowledge and understanding of the subject.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:06:28):**  He's quite an environmentalist and worries a lot about soil and stuff and because of  my background I was kind of brought up on a farm so it's all very commercial and he  wanted to double fence it three metres wide which is quite a lot of field to take out.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:06:52):**  So we had quite a lot of arguments in the field with the fencing contractor, they got  quite heated, I don't think I cried but I could well have done.  My concern was that it was going to take a big chunk of perfectly productive grassland  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:07:08):**  out so I had to get over that and watch all this perfectly good field being fenced but  as soon as we started planting and it started to grow I had to kind of eat my words because  it has been a huge benefit to the farm.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:07:25):**  It's probably saved many lives and it's only been up for two years and now we're looking  at doing more and planting more kilometres around the farm as hedges.  I think lots of farmers say to us so how much did you get paid for planting this hedge and  
**[0:07:46-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:07:46):**  I think as an industry we've got to realise that some environmental things we just need  to do off our own back just for the good of the countryside and for future generations  to come.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:08:00):**  We've seen a benefit from doing this in terms of shelter, it just seems like a no brainer  and if other farmers did it they would definitely see a benefit but it's a wider issue than  that really.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:08:14):**  The next step is to try and get this in the hands of the government and see if we can  put it into the next common agricultural policy or whatever it's going to be called in the  future.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:08:27):**  David Brass started the Lakes Free Range Eggs Company, one of the largest producers in the  UK.  They source from a collective of farms including their own and produce 300 million eggs every  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:08:40):**  year.  On all of these farms at least 20% of the farm must be planted in trees and they have  research which suggests that the trees benefit the chickens as well as greatly reduce the  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:08:53):**  amount of ammonia from chicken poo that's put into the environment.  I'm David Brass up in the Lake District and we farm chickens, free range chickens in the  Lake District.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:09:02):**  We think it's a little bit different as we plant lots of trees instead of open fields  outside for them to go out into.  It's a wooded area which they're much happier with, they come from jungle fowl, it's a bit  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:09:12):**  cliche, a bit naff but that's what they do, they're timid animals so they like to have  somewhere to hide from buzzards and things.  It started in 1997 when we first started planting trees, we just saw that on open fields, there's  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:09:25):**  an odd tree in the field, chickens would go underneath it and stay there rather than be  out in the open field.  So we thought to encourage birds to range outside we'd plant more trees and it worked  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:09:32):**  so we just kept doing it ever since.  Plant what's there, it grows very well, it also improves the biodiversity of the area  so why not.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:09:39):**  Plant them in rows, 4 to 5 metres apart, 2 metres apart within the rows because they're  easily managed for the first few years.  You can just drive up and down the rows with a topper to tear the grass out rather than  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:09:48):**  have to do it manually.  And then look after them, keep looking after them, they need more and more work, well not  more and more work, just every year they need some maintenance to look after them.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:09:58):**  We plant what's there, we do employ a guy who's a consultant in tree planting and technically  it's called Upland W8 Limestone Woodland but actually it's just what's there.  If we want to improve the biodiversity of what we're doing and the marketability of  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:10:11):**  our eggs which are all free range, why not improve the environment for red squirrels  and barns and bats and barn owls and things.  At the same time, some people maybe plant apple trees, we don't, we just go for what's  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:10:25):**  native to the area.  Biggest issues?  Oh little issues really, as you go along you just gradually change the way you plant them  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:10:33):**  and the planting plans and some of the species that you don't do particularly well.  And then the biggest lesson really we learned was to make sure you maintain them.  It doesn't take a lot of work but just every year there'd be something different you need  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:10:45):**  to do to look after your trees.  They don't just grow themselves, well they will grow themselves but it's a much slower  process.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:10:53):**  It's kind of interesting, over the years we've worked with a, it's a research establishment  down in Oxford, the Farm Animal Initiative and they put some science into what we do  so we actually do know the numbers.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:11:03):**  16,000 bird type free range unit, if you plant the trees, 20% of the ranging area with trees  it'll probably cost you maybe three, three and a half thousand pounds to do it, plus  your own labour to actually plant them but that's a direct cost.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:11:14):**  You recover that back in the first year, so after that, you know, three thousand pounds  a year, better profitability.  The birds don't die, they just show their mortality is less, they're less stressed,  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:11:24):**  they don't get the same diseases so that gives you more better quality eggs so it pays you  back.  It's a no brainer, once you get into chickens it's a no brainer really.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:11:34):**  And at the same time when you walk the dog at five o'clock in the morning it's nice to  walk through trees rather than just open muddy fields so no, there's no downsides to it  at all.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:12:05):**  Katie Hackmire is a farmer, food activist and the organiser of a symposium on women's  leadership in the food movement.  It took place near Sebastopol, California back in September and Abby was there.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:12:17):**  She spoke to Katie about her roundabout route into farming, why the event is so vital and  the ways men in the food movement can support their female colleagues.  My name's Katie Hackmire, I am the owner operator of Red H Farm among other things.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:12:31):**  I've been working in the food movement for about a decade now and what I've noticed over  time is that not only do I know factually that women grow half the food in the world  or more but anecdotally my own feeling and what I discovered was shared among most of  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:12:45):**  my female colleagues was that the food movement itself was very heavily populated by women  in the non-profit sector and academia, all these different avenues, it's women that you  see everywhere.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:12:54):**  And yet the voices here in the US that really prevail are male.  So the leading chefs are male, the leading journalists are male, the farmers that we  hear about all the time are these like old white male farmers and it became very frustrating  
**[0:13:07-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:13:07):**  and kind of enraging.  And I just felt like I really wanted to create a space where we could celebrate this more  quiet leadership that's happening because the people that are actually doing the work  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:13:17):**  on the ground, again anecdotally to me, it feels like it's women doing a hell of a lot  of the work.  And figuring out ways that their voices are not appropriated by the male executive directors  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:13:28):**  of the non-profits and things like that, it seemed really important to me.  And so creating this space where everyone can come together, so it's a conference celebrating  women but it's certainly not only for women, the more men that come I think that more powerful  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:13:39):**  that is.  So that women from across the movement, whether they're farmers working in policy and academia  and advocacy can come together and cross-pollinate and learn about the different things that  
**[0:13:47-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:13:47):**  are happening.  This year's theme was around storytelling and connection and collective resistance because  we're all struggling with this very dire political situation here in the US.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:13:57):**  That I also felt like bringing that theme kind of a more politicized theme this year  was also really important to help strengthen people's morale and also just the connections  that can be built through that.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:08):**  This work is really hard.  It's been quite a challenge for me to figure out how to balance doing the work on the land,  which keeps me grounded and I think makes me feel more genuine and rooted in the work

It's not hard emotionally, I mean I'm exhausted for sure, but it's hard financially.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:28):**  It's like, you know, it's work that is not traditionally financially valued in our society.  And so figuring out how to make this all financially viable is definitely a big step and figuring  out who really wants to support this work is a big step that will help with the longevity  
**[0:14:44-0:14:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:44):**  of it.  From a personal standpoint, it's like everything that I want to be doing.  You know, I mentioned at the end of the conference today that yesterday I was thinking, okay,  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:53):**  this might be it.  Like, you know, this is, it's a lot of work.  Like it's amazing, but it's a lot of work.  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:14:57):**  I have no idea how many people are going to come.  And then as soon as the first panel was 10 minutes in, all I think is, oh my God, how  can I not do this?  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:03):**  I have to keep doing this.  I have to keep bringing these people together and doing this work because it's so, it's  so moving and inspiring and it like, I feel like it's so important for us to all come  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:12):**  together like this.  So I think it's, it's time to start listening.  It's time to quiet your own voice and it's time to make space.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:22):**  I think that there's this idea that, oh, as long as we like hire women in our companies  and make jobs for women that somehow that is feminism and that is creating gender equality  and things like that.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:32):**  And I think it's actually about more than that.  It's about taking a step back in some ways and actually opening up that space for women  who are doing this work and who are doing it more quietly to step into a space of not  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:44):**  necessarily recognition, but like a space of being able to shine in the work that they're  doing.  I don't know if in the UK you have this concept called mansplaining that we have here in the  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:15:53):**  US.  It's baffling the people that talk to me about the food system, the men that at the farmer's  market want to explain the food system to me and I have to stop them and say, I teach  
**[0:16:04-0:16:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:04):**  this at a university.  I don't need you to explain it to me.  Stop and listen.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:09):**  Like know that the women around you have an amazing amount to say and amazing amount of  wisdom and knowledge and create that space is one is one huge piece.  And then provide allyship.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:21):**  We all know convening here how much power there's in this room and the amazing work  that's being done by women around the world.  There's an issue around women trying to make that understood by men and what women need  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:34):**  are their male allies to make that understood to other men.  We need men who are on board and who get it to be schooling the people around them, the  men around them that are still living in the dark ages around what all this means and what  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:16:50):**  they're not seeing in the world.  And that kind of allyship is going to be really crucial.  Just be quiet and listen and then speak out to your brotherhoods.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:01):**  Katie also spoke about the multiple pressures of expectation placed on small scale farmers  and why the current land tenure system makes this situation untenable.  Her comments relate to the USA, but they could also apply to the UK and elsewhere.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:16):**  So we're in a situation here in the US.  I mean, I could say a lot about this issue of land justice.  There's a book that was just published by Food First, the Institute for Food Development  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:24):**  Policy called Land Justice, Reimagining Land, Food and the Commons in the United States.  So it is US specific.  But I think that the themes and the dialogue are certainly applicable across the world,  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:36):**  and particularly in a place like Britain.  There's a lot of dialogue around colonialism and race and class and things that I think  are really applicable to anywhere in the Western world.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:45):**  I wrote a chapter that looked at the issue of land access and land security and tenure  for the new farming generation.  And we have this huge conundrum here that I'm sure is similar in Europe.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:17:55):**  The production value of land can never match the market value.  So food production and farming, ecological farming will never support the land that it  needs to grow on.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:18:06):**  The market for ecologically grown products is inherently in areas where the land values  are the highest, all sorts of political layers to that, of course.  But it makes farming really difficult because farmers really have very insecure land tenure.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:18:17):**  So essentially, this is the deal.  We're expecting this new generation of farmers to make high risk, high cost, low return financial  commitments, which in a neoliberal economy that we are stuck in, we would never expect  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:18:31):**  anywhere else.  And I think that what we're doing in expecting this Bohemian class of farmers to just keep  doing it for the love of it and to continue this movement and this new wave of back to  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:18:41):**  the land, I think we're building a house of cards.  We're expecting farmers to steward the land for future generations, to manage these environmental  systems, to create this whole new food economy that we want, to create this cultural situation  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:18:55):**  that we want, which is really what these boutique farms that I am a part of are doing.  And most importantly, the biggest thing that we're expecting globally is for small scale  farmers to essentially be on the front lines of mitigating climate change.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:19:08):**  And we're expecting all this from people who are essentially sharecropping on wealthy people's  land.  You can ask anyone who's rented in the food system, any grower or producer that's rented.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:19:18):**  It's so complicated and it's so challenging working with landowners and it's no one's  fault.  It's just about different expectations or different understandings and personalities  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:19:27):**  and all those things.  It's not that anyone's to blame, but we have this private property system here in the U.S.  that means that farmers can't actually afford the land that they need to farm on.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:19:36):**  And yet we're expecting them to solve all of these social and environmental crises that  we have.  Land is like a farmer's investment portfolio.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:19:44):**  There's certainly financial benefits to ecological production quickly, but the real benefit is  in these long, deep, complex ecosystems that are built, these landscapes that are built  over time, decades, generations.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:19:55):**  And if we want farmers to be farming in that way, when they could make as much money farming  still organically, but like in a much less regenerative way, then we need to figure out  ways that actually make sense for them and that they actually have tenure on their land.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:08):**  That's a piece of the dialogue around land justice that I can bring.  There's certainly a much larger political dialogue around indigenous land, around black  agrarianism, around gender and land, all sorts of things.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:21):**  And the piece that I've engaged with is kind of this piece that I have a very personal  connection to.  Okay.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:27):**  So thank you to Katie and Katie.  Abby, you were at the conference.  What did you make of it?  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:37):**  I had actually never been to a conference that was all women speaking.  All of the many different stories the women were telling were really inspiring.  So in a way, I guess it's like any great conference you go to, it was a really nourishing  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:20:53):**  experience.  It was about how can we all work together to have a more diverse voice coming from the  farming world?  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:03):**  Because there certainly are many women working in the farming world.  How can that be more reflected in communications and in leadership roles?  And in particular, they were asking, what does it look like for if you have a female  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:18):**  rancher?  Okay.  So Abby, for this is in the UK, a rancher is that's like somebody who has a lot of cows.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:28):**  Exactly.  Someone who has a lot of cows or sheep and they range over a large area.  So there was a rancher there who's about my age and she was asking questions like, you  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:39):**  know, the reason she'd gone into ranching was after many years in the farming industry,  she'd really gotten affinity with regenerative agriculture in terms of how she can use these  wonderful animals to regenerate land on a large scale.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:21:59):**  And also she has a real affinity with animals.  And she was saying, what does it look like to manage animals in a more feminine way?  Because for her, a lot of the people she'd seen managing animals did it in a very kind  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:14):**  of aggressive sort of taking charge of the animals.  And for her, well, physically, you know, she wasn't in the position to really be doing  that.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:25):**  And so it's questions like that, like what are those differences?  And she put it as like, what is a feminine land ethic?  My main takeaway is that there are already many exciting women working in the farming  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:38):**  world and the food world.  And that we need to be more proactive about surfacing those voices.  Thanks.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:22:50):**  And that's actually something that we take quite seriously when we're putting Farm  Armour together, and we are about to start publishing some data about the diversity of  the people who make the show and the people who we have on air.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:23:08):**  It's been interesting to look at the data from the last few episodes.  And sometimes we think we're doing a good job, but this is really actually holding ourselves  to account and saying, are we doing as well as we thought?  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:23:18):**  And I think the answer is we can do a lot better.  Yeah, agreed.  We rely on supporters to keep the show alive.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:23:30):**  So if anyone wants to support us or know someone they think would like to, then please get  in touch.  We'll send you our supporters offer with more information.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:23:45):**  Over the next few months, we're going to be checking in with a farmer who's taking on  the job of creating a market garden from scratch.  Joel Rodker is just at the start of this journey.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:23:56):**  And we'll be along with him for the ride, learning with him and sharing experiences  which I bet are oh so familiar to so many of you.  Here's Joel to introduce himself and set the scene.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:10):**  My name's Joel.  I'm setting up a market garden in Cambridgeshire, just outside Peterborough.  I'm on an existing farm which is run by Stephen and Lynn Briggs.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:22):**  And they are arable farmers with some fruit, fruit tree agroforestry.  They're opening up a farm shop soon.  And I'm going to be growing the fresh produce for the shop.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:36):**  So that's hopefully going to include vegetables, herbs and flowers.  So so far, I'm in the third week now and I'm only here two or three days a week.  I have dug over 360 meters squared.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:24:52):**  It's pretty slow going.  The soil is really amazing.  It's very light, it's very fertile, but there's quite a lot of couch grass root in the soil.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:25:01):**  So I'm trying to get as much of that out as possible, which is heavy going.  I can't really think of an alternative to digging it out of a fork.  But I am probably going to cover some of the area with silage sheet just so I don't have  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:25:17):**  to worry about the weeds coming back until I get around to digging it.  I'm getting lots of transplants in plugs from Delfland Nurseries because I haven't had time  to sow anything myself.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:25:30):**  So I've got lots of brassicas, some onions, spinach, a few other lettuces and things,  which I am going to put in and have been putting in over the winter.  Most of that won't need covering, shouldn't need covering.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:25:47):**  I guess at the moment, things that I'm a little bit concerned about are the lack of irrigation.  We're still applying for an irrigation license.  So there is a sort of temporary watering system set up, but it's not that efficient.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:02):**  I can use watering cans, but that takes quite a long time.  So hopefully, given the time of year, it shouldn't be too dry, although it hasn't rained much  recently.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:11):**  I'm thinking about how I'm going to arrange the post-harvest infrastructure.  That's quite a big job.  I'm not quite sure where that's going to go and how that's going to be designed.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:23):**  And getting ready for sowing in spring, I guess, is another big challenge that I'm thinking  about what seeds I need to water, what crops I want.  There's a lot of different things going on in my head at the moment, but I guess while  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:38):**  I'm digging out the couch grass, I've got a lot of time to think.  So I can mull all those things over in my mind.  And once I've dug enough ground to plant the plugs that I've bought, then I can maybe start  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:26:54):**  to look at some of the other infrastructure that needs doing.  I guess the best thing so far has just been starting, because I've been thinking about  this for a long time, and to finally be setting everything out and doing what I've been thinking  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-27-agroforestry-with-sheep-chickens-female-farming-voices-starting-a-market-garden#t=0:27:10):**  about for a long time is quite hard to believe, actually.  So that's a great feeling.  Yesterday a friend came over and took some drone footage, and that was really nice to

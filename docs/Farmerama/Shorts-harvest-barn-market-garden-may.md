**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:00:00):**  It's Thursday the 24th of May, I'm in the polytunnel again and it's actually raining  as you can hear. I think the last time I recorded something for Farmerama it was raining and  I was in the polytunnel but actually it's been very dry and warm the last few weeks  
**[0:00:20-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:00:20):**  so this is unusual and very welcome. Although I have just been hoeing one of the blocks  that was full of red shank which is a weed which is new to me but it's everywhere and  that was starting to get a little bit out of control so I've just been hoeing but of  
**[0:00:42-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:00:42):**  course hoeing before rain is not a good idea. I think half of the block was okay by the  time I'd done that most of the weeds had shriveled up in the sun but then clouds came in and  it started raining so I may have to do it again if some of those weeds don't die. So  
**[0:01:01-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:01:01):**  I'm in the polytunnel surrounded by trays of seedlings. I've sown since the polytunnel  went up hundreds of seedlings, tomatoes, peppers, chillies. Some of those peppers and chillies  haven't germinated as well as I was hoping and maybe they take a bit longer than I thought.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:01:20):**  I've also had a bit of trouble with lettuce and spinach which I think is due to high temperatures  so I'm going to try and keep those trays out of the polytunnel after I've sown them. But  most things are doing really well. Lots of brassicas, onions, leeks, lettuces, courgettes,  
**[0:01:41-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:01:41):**  squash, some sweetcorn, cucumbers. So I'm waiting to plant those out. The main delay  with that is that there seems to be some kind of nutrient deficiency in the soil. It may  be lack of nitrogen due to the cold and wet winter but I've got a feeling it's a trace  
**[0:02:02-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:02:02):**  element like boron or manganese, possibly iron. A lot of the plants that were in the  soil already have got yellow blotchy leaves. Some of them have just died. So that's a bit  worrying and a bit frustrating. So another delay. Everything feels like it's very far  
**[0:02:24-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:02:24):**  behind but hopefully things will catch up. So I'm just trying to sow a few trays of seedlings  each week which is good for a succession so I'll have batches of crops coming in to harvest  in succession which would be great because I don't really know how much of everything  
**[0:02:44-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:02:44):**  I can sell and now certain things are bolting so I haven't actually got much coming on.  There's going to be a bit of delay before I have new crops to harvest so that's a bit  of a shame because the shop could do with some more produce. I'm just about managing  
**[0:03:02-0:03:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:03:02):**  to get some bags of salad leaves, was getting head lettuce, spinach, some spring onions  and parsley now I'm able to harvest. So it's a little bit frustrating but great to be able  to get things going in the trays in the polytunnel and give them a bit of a head start before  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:03:23):**  planting out.

**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:00:00):**  It's Thursday the 24th of May, I'm in the polytunnel again and it's actually raining  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:00:10):**  as you can hear. I think the last time I recorded something for Farmerama it was raining and  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:00:15):**  I was in the polytunnel but actually it's been very dry and warm the last few weeks  
**[0:00:20-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:00:20):**  so this is unusual and very welcome. Although I have just been hoeing one of the blocks  
**[0:00:27-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:00:27):**  that was full of red shank which is a weed which is new to me but it's everywhere and  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:00:37):**  that was starting to get a little bit out of control so I've just been hoeing but of  
**[0:00:42-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:00:42):**  course hoeing before rain is not a good idea. I think half of the block was okay by the  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:00:51):**  time I'd done that most of the weeds had shriveled up in the sun but then clouds came in and  
**[0:00:55-0:01:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:00:55):**  it started raining so I may have to do it again if some of those weeds don't die. So  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:01:01):**  I'm in the polytunnel surrounded by trays of seedlings. I've sown since the polytunnel  
**[0:01:07-0:01:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:01:07):**  went up hundreds of seedlings, tomatoes, peppers, chillies. Some of those peppers and chillies  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:01:14):**  haven't germinated as well as I was hoping and maybe they take a bit longer than I thought.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:01:20):**  I've also had a bit of trouble with lettuce and spinach which I think is due to high temperatures  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:01:26):**  so I'm going to try and keep those trays out of the polytunnel after I've sown them. But  
**[0:01:32-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:01:32):**  most things are doing really well. Lots of brassicas, onions, leeks, lettuces, courgettes,  
**[0:01:41-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:01:41):**  squash, some sweetcorn, cucumbers. So I'm waiting to plant those out. The main delay  
**[0:01:50-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:01:50):**  with that is that there seems to be some kind of nutrient deficiency in the soil. It may  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:01:57):**  be lack of nitrogen due to the cold and wet winter but I've got a feeling it's a trace  
**[0:02:02-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:02:02):**  element like boron or manganese, possibly iron. A lot of the plants that were in the  
**[0:02:11-0:02:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:02:11):**  soil already have got yellow blotchy leaves. Some of them have just died. So that's a bit  
**[0:02:17-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:02:17):**  worrying and a bit frustrating. So another delay. Everything feels like it's very far  
**[0:02:24-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:02:24):**  behind but hopefully things will catch up. So I'm just trying to sow a few trays of seedlings  
**[0:02:31-0:02:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:02:31):**  each week which is good for a succession so I'll have batches of crops coming in to harvest  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:02:40):**  in succession which would be great because I don't really know how much of everything  
**[0:02:44-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:02:44):**  I can sell and now certain things are bolting so I haven't actually got much coming on.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:02:52):**  There's going to be a bit of delay before I have new crops to harvest so that's a bit  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:02:56):**  of a shame because the shop could do with some more produce. I'm just about managing  
**[0:03:02-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:03:02):**  to get some bags of salad leaves, was getting head lettuce, spinach, some spring onions  
**[0:03:09-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:03:09):**  and parsley now I'm able to harvest. So it's a little bit frustrating but great to be able  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:03:17):**  to get things going in the trays in the polytunnel and give them a bit of a head start before  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-may#t=0:03:23):**  planting out.

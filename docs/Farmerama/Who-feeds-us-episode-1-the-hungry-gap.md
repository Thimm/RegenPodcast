**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:00:00):**  Of course, in January, nobody thought we were going to be where we are now.  
**[0:00:05-0:00:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:00:05):**  Nobody thought we're going to be in sort of a national lockdown, or even international  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:00:09):**  lockdown come March.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:00:14):**  We entered lockdown and realised that the restaurant was no longer going to support  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:00:17):**  the farm and we had to make some quick changes and work out a way to flip those roles on  
**[0:00:23-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:00:23):**  our head.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:00:25):**  We literally shut down overnight.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:00:28):**  I think for a while it was sort of stunned.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:00:33):**  I still actually struggle to believe it tangibly or really what's just happened.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:00:40):**  A lot of people were losing the breadwinner and were really struggling and coming to me  
**[0:00:45-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:00:45):**  and saying Ursula, I've got no food, I can't feed my kids.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:00:51):**  There is a lot of grief that is on pause.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:00:54):**  I've had people say to me, listen, Ursula, my husband left the house or my son left the  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:00:58):**  house in an ambulance.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:01:00):**  So I could only speak to them on the phone through a nurse.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:01:04):**  And then the next thing I know, they're telling me that that coffin over there has my son  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:01:09):**  or has my husband in there.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:01:12):**  I'm not accepting that because I didn't go through the rites or the rituals.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:01:16):**  I didn't get to kiss him goodbye.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:01:18):**  I didn't get to hold his hand.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:01:20):**  I didn't get to comb his hair.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:01:34):**  Who Feeds Us? from Farmerama Episode 1 The Hungry Gap  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:01:41):**  This series is a chorus of voices from people across the British Isles, people on the land  
**[0:01:47-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:01:47):**  and the seas, on allotments and city roofs.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:01:50):**  The stories of farmers, growers, community leaders, healers, chefs, beekeepers, fishers  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:01:57):**  and others.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:01:59):**  This is Who Feeds Us?  
**[0:02:02-0:02:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:02:02):**  As the COVID-19 lockdown hit the UK in early 2020, our nation suddenly looked very different.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:02:11):**  Supermarket shelves were empty and for the first time in most people's lives, we started  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:02:15):**  to question how we were going to feed ourselves and our families.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:02:20):**  Almost overnight, localised food systems went from being niche fantasies to a vital source  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:02:26):**  of sustenance for many people around the country.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:02:30):**  One thing this pandemic has made clear is that food doesn't come from supermarket shelves.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:02:36):**  It never did.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:02:38):**  Food comes from the soil, the sea and the hands of people.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:02:44):**  In this series, we hear from those people.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:02:47):**  People who stepped up back in March to feed the nation, who are still feeding us today  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:02:52):**  and who we're all relying on to feed us in the future.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:02:57):**  This is a celebration of these key workers, a thank you and a call to action so we don't  
**[0:03:03-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:03:03):**  forget just how key they are.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:03:11):**  I'm Katie Ravel, one of the producers of Farmorama.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:03:15):**  There's something else I'd like you to know about this series.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:03:19):**  It's the result of contributions from a huge number of different people, 23 in total.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:03:24):**  We worked with six audio producers as well as six community collaborators from across  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:03:29):**  the UK.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:03:32):**  These community collaborators highlighted stories from within their communities and  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:03:36):**  it's these stories that we'll be sharing with you throughout the series.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:03:40):**  You'll also find a collection of additional stories on our blog.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:03:44):**  We've taken this approach because we want you to hear stories from the ground, literally  
**[0:03:48-0:03:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:03:48):**  and figuratively.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:03:50):**  Amidst the dramatic headlines and apocalyptic news footage, as we all stockpiled flour and  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:03:55):**  tinned tomatoes, what was really happening on our farms and market gardens, in our dairies  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:04:01):**  and bakeries, in our food banks and community kitchens?  
**[0:04:05-0:04:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:04:05):**  Who are the people who baked that loaf of bread, delivered that milk and harvested those  
**[0:04:12-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:04:12):**  vegetables?  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:04:14):**  In the words of one of our community collaborators, Highlands-based farmer Carl Gordon,  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:04:19):**  Food is something that connects everyone more than just about anything else.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:04:24):**  Everyone has to eat.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:04:26):**  Getting to know someone you get your food from is really a massive part of hopefully  
**[0:04:32-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:04:32):**  what's come out of this.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:04:33):**  And I think there's a lot of people who maybe have done that for possibly the first time.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:04:38):**  They felt that the farmer has become something or the food producers sort of returned to  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:04:43):**  being something that is important within a community, as opposed to someone who just  
**[0:04:48-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:04:48):**  does something that gets put in the back of a truck and off it goes somewhere else.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:04:55):**  By getting to know our food producers, we can make a big difference in terms of what  
**[0:05:01-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:05:01):**  everywhere looks like because you're looking at somewhere as opposed to anywhere.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:05:08):**  In this first episode, we'll hear four stories from four very different corners of the food  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:05:13):**  system.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:05:14):**  From people supplying high-end restaurants to people on the front lines of emergency  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:05:19):**  food provision.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:05:20):**  They've all been profoundly affected by the crisis and they've all responded in creative  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:05:25):**  ways to sustain themselves and their communities.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:05:32):**  In this episode, they share their experience of the crisis so far.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:05:37):**  We'll be meeting each of them again in the final episode to hear their visions for the  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:05:41):**  future.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:05:43):**  We begin with a farmer and a chef who have an especially close partnership.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:05:48):**  My name is Jane Scotta.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:05:50):**  I am a biodynamic farmer at my farm called Fernborough, which is in Herefordshire, which  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:05:56):**  is on the Welsh-English border in the West of England.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:06:00):**  I grow vegetables, fruit and flowers for Sky's Restaurant Spring in London and have been  
**[0:06:07-0:06:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:06:07):**  doing that for the past six years.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:06:09):**  I'm Sky Gingell and I'm, I guess people call me a chef, but I feel much more comfortable  
**[0:06:17-0:06:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:06:17):**  with the word cook and I have a restaurant in London called Spring and I also work, as  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:06:26):**  does Jane actually, with a hotel in Hampshire that also, Jane's in the process of converting  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:06:32):**  to a biodynamic farm, so we work on that project together as well.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:06:36):**  Well, I've been taking my produce to London for quite a long time before I met Sky.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:06:43):**  I was selling at Borough Market and then at Morby Street and I think perhaps Sky had visited,  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:06:50):**  knew about the vegetables and just out of the blue she wrote to me one day, this was  
**[0:06:55-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:06:55):**  probably in about June 2015, that she was opening a restaurant in October of that year  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:02):**  and she was looking for a farm to work with and would we be interested and it was exactly  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:07):**  what we had in mind.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:08):**  I sort of, yeah, it fell out of the sky really, it's lovely.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:11):**  It was 2014, Jane.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:13):**  Was it?  
**[0:07:14-0:07:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:14):**  Yeah, yeah, it's our sixth year working together, we're coming to the end of our sixth year.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:21):**  I'd always sort of known about these kind of relationships that certain restaurants  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:25):**  had with farms, like a really intimate, very personal relationship.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:29):**  It's kind of like a marriage and over the years we've had a few disagreements because  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:33):**  there was so much to iron out, especially in the beginning and you know, we had to learn  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:37):**  to trust each other, didn't we?  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:40):**  I make money and I'm able to do it in the way that I want to do it, by working with  
**[0:07:45-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:45):**  Sky.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:46):**  I mean, I know I've said this before to you Jane and I genuinely mean this, I don't think  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:51):**  I could work without Jane any longer and I don't really know where her work finishes  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:56):**  and mine begins.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:07:58):**  There's absolutely as much, and sometimes a lot more actually, of Jane's work on that  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:08:03):**  plate than there is mine.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:08:05):**  I'm very inspired by seeing the plates because they're doing exactly what I would like to  
**[0:08:10-0:08:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:08:10):**  have done with the food that I grow.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:08:17):**  Often I taste something and then it's like a memory and then I search for that for later  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:08:22):**  and I think with just growing it I knew I'd find that.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:08:25):**  I mean, certainly did with potatoes, you know, I remember tasting potatoes as a child and  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:08:31):**  I really liked them and then just my early adult life, never finding anything that would  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:08:36):**  ever taste like that again.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:08:38):**  It was the will and the wanting to get it right and appreciating the variety and the  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:08:44):**  richness that it brings.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:08:48):**  It's always felt really right being in a kitchen and being around food.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:08:52):**  I mean, I think I love it probably more now than I did in the beginning.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:08:56):**  It's been something that I've never tired of and actually I think our relationship is  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:09:01):**  so lovely because it really has opened up a whole new kind of vista for me actually  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:09:07):**  and way of cooking which has kind of completely re-inspired me in the last few years.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:09:12):**  Spontaneity as well of the seasons, you know.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:09:15):**  It's the pure beauty of the whole thing, it's just completely mesmerising.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:09:27):**  For me I always know that Skye always has my interests at heart and when I'm growing  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:09:34):**  food or harvesting that then that's how I feel about picking it and making sure it's  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:09:39):**  the best I can do for her so that her business thrives and we can always do this.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:09:45):**  Yeah we've got each other's backs that's for sure.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:09:50):**  Definitely.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:09:52):**  And then coronavirus hit and virtually overnight the UK's restaurant industry shut down.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:09:59):**  I think it was March the 14th that we closed.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:10:02):**  I think that was the day if I'm correct that you know Boris Johnson made that statement  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:10:07):**  where nobody go to clubs, pubs, restaurants anymore but he hadn't actually officially  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:10:12):**  closed them down and I think from the moment that that happened it was really obvious that  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:10:18):**  you could no longer continue you know to run and open the restaurant and so we literally  
**[0:10:23-0:10:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:10:23):**  shut down within two days of that happening and then I think for a while it was sort of  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:10:31):**  stunned like it wasn't it I mean it was just like you know I think the comprehension of  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:10:37):**  what was happening was just I still actually struggle to believe it tangibly or really  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:10:44):**  what's just happened I was incredibly aware of all the people that also it's not just  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:10:49):**  us and you know the kind of 58 people that worked at the spring it was also Jane and  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:10:55):**  the farm and so we kind of reinvented ourselves very quickly didn't we Jane and we opened  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:11:00):**  a shop.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:11:01):**  Yeah within a week made a website.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:11:03):**  Yeah made a Shopify account, sold Jane's veg boxes, learnt to pack boxes, learnt to do  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:11:11):**  deliveries and then and at the same time we added you know stuff that spring does all  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:11:16):**  our breads the butters we make, liqueurs, jams, cordials and we're actually still doing  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:11:22):**  that so we've been doing that for six months now.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:11:26):**  But lockdown came into effect just as the UK was entering its least plentiful growing  
**[0:11:31-0:11:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:11:31):**  season.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:11:32):**  I was doing a little box scheme sort of with the overflow of produce myself anyway before  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:11:38):**  but then suddenly it went absolutely mad and you know it was a bad time really it was a  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:11:42):**  time that we had very little so we were really scratching around and we sold out of everything  
**[0:11:48-0:11:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:11:48):**  within five weeks I suppose.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:11:51):**  Then of course you know that season had ended and everything was going into the ground but  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:11:57):**  wasn't big enough yet so we had about a five-week slot where there was very very little to sell  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:12:03):**  you know if it had happened in July we'd have you know been laughing but so that that sort  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:12:08):**  of you know stopped us in our tracks a bit.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:12:13):**  When the coronavirus came and people really wanted fruit and veg it was also in what's  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:12:18):**  known as the hunger gap it was a time that there is little and then and also getting  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:12:23):**  people to try and understand they go I really like your box of fruit and vegetables but  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:12:27):**  actually I really would like to see a potato or this or that and you go okay well if you  
**[0:12:31-0:12:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:12:31):**  want to eat seasonally and you want to buy locally they aren't here.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:12:38):**  People think of spring and they think oh my gosh the winter's over and the winter's actually  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:12:43):**  a very deep and rich kind of tapestry of I it's one of my favorite seasons actually I  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:12:49):**  have to say I in fact I think it is my favorite growing season because I love what comes and  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:12:55):**  the flavors that come from the winter are so kind of nutty and sweet and crinkly and  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:13:00):**  irony and like delicious but um but I think people see spring and they go oh god there  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:13:05):**  must be loads of stuff and actually spring is probably the most fallow time of the whole  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:13:10):**  year isn't it's when you clear the land and replant.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:13:15):**  Nothing will come until the middle of June it has to grow.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:13:21):**  I feel like people wanted to make a connection make some sense of something real they probably  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:13:26):**  thought that they really had time to cook because life had stopped in a different way.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:13:31):**  And they're treating themselves a bit too weren't they at the beginning I think people  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:13:35):**  are buying lots of nice things to cheer themselves up yeah.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:13:40):**  We really noticed that people were buying so many cakes and we saw this cookie dough  
**[0:13:45-0:13:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:13:45):**  like we couldn't make enough cookie dough and jams and ice buns and biscuits and cordials  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:13:52):**  and ice creams we just couldn't make enough ice cream really.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:13:57):**  Can I can I be really dreadful I've got a pan on and I think it might be burning.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:14:03):**  We'll hear more about how Skye and Jane have adapted as well as their thoughts on the future  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:14:12):**  of our food system later in the series.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:14:18):**  Angus Buchanan-Smith grew up in Scotland on his family's dairy farm.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:14:23):**  He trained as a graphic designer before returning to the farm five years ago.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:14:28):**  We're a little farm based just outside Edinburgh in Scotland.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:14:32):**  We're set at the foot of the Pentland Hills so I'm in the office right now but looking  
**[0:14:37-0:14:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:14:37):**  across the farm we've got about it's actually 400 acres of grassland here and we're only  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:14:45):**  actively farming about 10 acres roughly.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:14:50):**  For the last about 100 years my family has been based on this on this ground and it's  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:14:57):**  always traditionally been dairying because of the weather here and because the altitude  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:15:01):**  we grow really good grass but unfortunately the turn of the century there was a bit of  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:15:06):**  a bit of a dairy crisis and my parents just weren't able to make it stack up and it was  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:15:11):**  unfortunately shortly before they had invested largely in a new milking parlour.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:15:17):**  For many years they're really unsure about what else should happen here and they ummed  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:15:21):**  and arred and they had a lot of debt to look after and they were just kind of concerned  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:15:25):**  about what was going to happen and that's that's kind of when me and my brother and  
**[0:15:28-0:15:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:15:28):**  actually some really good friends stepped in and we were like wait a minute surely there's  
**[0:15:31-0:15:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:15:31):**  something else we can do here to preserve the farm and give it a new lease of life.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:15:40):**  Once we started talking about the possibility of actually taking over and having a bit more  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:15:44):**  responsibility it all started to line up and make sense and yeah just really thrilled to  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:15:50):**  still be here today and to see the farm you know it's running in a very different way  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:15:54):**  but to still to still be here and you know and there's a legacy there that I feel very  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:15:59):**  proud to be part of.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:16:06):**  Back in 2015 myself my brother and a few friends identified there was basically another dairy  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:16:11):**  crisis and we thought what can we do to basically help some of these farmers that were struggling.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:16:16):**  So long story short we travelled in the UK hosting dinners on farms and the idea was  
**[0:16:21-0:16:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:16:21):**  to generate more awareness about the importance of supporting local small-scale farmers primarily  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:16:29):**  dairy farmers but whilst doing this we realised that it wasn't just the dairy farmers that  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:16:34):**  were struggling that they were basically all farmers small-scale across the board were  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:16:39):**  struggling in different ways.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:16:41):**  So we came back to the farm and set up a way to host dinners from the farm and spread the  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:16:46):**  same message.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:16:47):**  Angus and his friends set up The Free Company, a project that's grown from a seasonal farm  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:16:52):**  to table restaurant to include a community supported agriculture scheme or a veg club  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:16:58):**  and soon a centre for rural learning.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:17:01):**  So that's basically what we did we did a very minimal renovation on one of the old barns  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:17:05):**  here created this beautiful dining room with these guys and started started cooking these  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:17:09):**  meals and it was we knew that we could grow a certain amount of food ourselves so we've  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:17:14):**  always had the garden that supported the restaurant.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:17:16):**  It basically allowed us to pop up for a short period of time generate a whole lot of buzz  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:17:21):**  about what we were doing about the seasonality of produce at that time get people in and  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:17:26):**  then tell the story about the produce where it's come from how it's grown and also highlight  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:17:31):**  other other suppliers and local farmers that we're working with.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:17:36):**  So much of the food that we grow it all goes straight into the restaurant and the way it  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:17:40):**  works is our guests can arrive and they can walk around the garden and we'll serve them  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:17:45):**  some little snacks or canapes and they can see exactly where everything's coming from  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:17:49):**  and then when they sit down in the dining room we basically walk through each individual  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:17:53):**  course and talk about why we're so excited to be supporting a cheese supplier from the  
**[0:17:58-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:17:58):**  west coast and getting our butter from somewhere else or whatever it may be and it's basically  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:18:06):**  creating a narrative and sharing the stories and sharing the important knowledge that's  
**[0:18:10-0:18:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:18:10):**  kind of rooted in where our food comes from.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:18:20):**  Back in March we had received just under 3,000 reservations for the restaurant and although  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:18:27):**  we are a restaurant based on a farm for the last four years it has been the restaurant  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:18:33):**  that has supported the farm and the creation of the restaurant that has kept everything  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:18:37):**  afloat here so when we entered lockdown and realized that the restaurant was no longer  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:18:42):**  gonna support the farm in that way we had to make some quick changes and work out a  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:18:47):**  way to flip those roles on their head and work out a way for the farm to support the  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:18:53):**  restaurant.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:18:54):**  With the restaurant forced to close Angus and the Free Company team shifted their focus  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:18:59):**  to growing for wholesale and their veg club.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:19:02):**  And so luckily being back in March and going into the spring and the warm weather we were  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:19:07):**  able to pivot and basically upscale the garden.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:19:10):**  We basically upscaled our production as much as we possibly could with the team that we  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:19:14):**  had on board at that time in an effort to basically create a lifeline for us to get  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:19:18):**  through the summer and we're now looking at you know making sure this lifeline continues  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:19:23):**  right through the winter until next year.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:19:25):**  We'll hear more about how the Free Company's been impacted by the crisis and Angus' response  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:19:30):**  to it in the final episode of Who Feeds Us.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:19:34):**  Like many of the people featured in this series Angus doesn't believe the pandemic has caused  
**[0:19:39-0:19:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:19:39):**  our food system to become dysfunctional but it has heightened amplified and focused attention  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:19:46):**  on existing problems.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:19:47):**  I would argue that our conventional supply chains are failing us.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:19:52):**  The fact that there are so few organic farmers out there is very problematic.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:19:56):**  The fact that we have okay yeah we have we have choice we can buy vegetables from all  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:20:01):**  over the world at any one point whenever we like but actually we don't have choice for  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:20:06):**  what's actually grown at our own doorstep.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:20:08):**  It's very hard to go into a conventional supermarket and say I want to buy stuff that's actually  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:20:12):**  grown within a 10 mile radius.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:20:13):**  It's impossible.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:20:15):**  Convenience has driven the food chain to be where it is today.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:20:20):**  Price and convenience.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:20:21):**  So that's something that's a very tall order to compete against in the way that supermarkets  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:20:26):**  are currently supplying food is extremely convenient at a very affordable price.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:20:31):**  The current global supply system is great at delivering food in a way that appears to  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:20:36):**  be convenient and cheap at least if all you're looking at is the till receipt.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:20:41):**  But what the pandemic has made clear is that it's a system that doesn't offer resilience  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:20:46):**  in the face of crisis.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:20:49):**  Can we afford to be reliant on a system based on long tenuous global supply chains and just  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:20:54):**  in time delivery on a system that lacks the flexibility to respond or adapt to unexpected  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:21:00):**  events.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:21:01):**  As consumers as eaters we've grown further and further away from the people the places  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:21:08):**  and the natural systems that produce our food.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:21:11):**  Even like 25 50 years ago almost everyone had a connection to a farm in one way or another  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:21:17):**  you know whether it was a great uncle or a grandfather or whatever they used to live  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:21:21):**  on a farm.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:21:22):**  I think that almost everyone had some kind of connection you know they would go there  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:21:26):**  on their summer holidays or they would hear about their father going to you know do hay  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:21:31):**  harvest or whatever I think I think that very much was the way of life in the UK for a long  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:21:36):**  time and until recently I think we've just recently arrived at the point where so many  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:21:41):**  people just do not have any kind of connection to a farm.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:21:47):**  I think that there is just a there is a divide there is a massive divide between people's  
**[0:21:52-0:22:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:21:52):**  understandings of farms and foods and where their food comes from.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:22:00):**  Reconnecting with where our food comes from means forging stronger ties not just with  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:22:04):**  farmers and other food producers but also with the land itself and with the plants and  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:22:09):**  animals that keep us fed and healthy and that includes insects.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:22:15):**  Salma and Khalil Atan are beekeepers in East London.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:22:19):**  Their interest in beekeeping was sparked by a situation that will be familiar to many  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:22:23):**  of us.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:22:24):**  Khalil used to have really bad hay fever and most of the summer it would be sort of a dripping  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:22:32):**  nose and you know swollen eyes and just looked like he'd been crying all the time.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:22:38):**  It would be so bad that you know I couldn't go out of the house some days it was you know  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:22:42):**  debilitating almost for a day.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:22:44):**  We found out that oh local honey might actually be helpful it might be one of these things  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:22:50):**  that helps towards hay fever and this was about 12-13 years ago we're talking about  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:22:56):**  so we were looking for local honey.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:22:59):**  It was actually quite difficult to get a hold of in our area it wasn't an easy item to find.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:23:05):**  So they took matters into their own hands.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:23:08):**  They trained as beekeepers and took on a hive.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:23:11):**  And now I hardly have to take anything at all.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:23:13):**  You know we have honey day in day out.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:23:16):**  I have it in my tea, I have it in my coffee, we have it every single day you know at least  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:23:21):**  a couple of times a day and I'm sure it's helped me.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:23:25):**  Local honey because it's not finely filtered it still contains all the goodness of you  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:23:31):**  know raw honey and it has all local pollen in there as well.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:23:35):**  So if it's the local pollen from the trees and the flowers which is causing your problem  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:23:40):**  then there's a possibility that it will help you and it's helped me.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:23:44):**  Salma and Khalil have experienced the many advantages that come with short transparent  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:23:49):**  supply chains.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:23:50):**  They're in total control of how their bees are cared for and that influences the quality  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:23:55):**  of their honey.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:23:57):**  In 2011 the bees became part of the community at the East London Mosque.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:24:02):**  At the time we were actually looking for another site to keep our bees.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:24:07):**  So we were looking for another apiary site and we just thought let's just ask.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:24:12):**  We didn't know what they would say, we didn't have any expectations and it took them a little  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:24:17):**  while to get back to us.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:24:18):**  They must have had some interesting conversations I think about that.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:24:21):**  Yeah I mean we found out afterwards they had a few committee meetings about it and you  
**[0:24:26-0:24:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:24:26):**  know they were really for it.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:24:27):**  They were really pleased with the idea, they really liked the idea of having bees on the  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:24:32):**  roof.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:24:33):**  I think a couple of the committee members really really loved honey as well so I think  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:24:36):**  that helped but they were very very supportive from the word go and that was in 2011.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:24:41):**  We had one colony there and now on the roof we have at the moment eight, seven.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:24:49):**  We've got seven on the roof and we have four in a purpose-built observation area as well.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:24:55):**  Because we've expanded so much now and we have so many hives and we get so much excess  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:24:59):**  honey, you know we came up with the idea that okay why don't you set up a business and you  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:25:03):**  know try to sell some honey, make it available to the local community, you know let them  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:25:08):**  share in some of the goodness of local raw honey as well.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:25:12):**  Just as Salma and Khalil were launching their business, Bushwood Bees, the coronavirus crisis  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:25:17):**  hit.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:25:18):**  Of course in January nobody thought we were going to be where we are now, nobody thought  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:25:24):**  we're going to be in sort of a national lockdown or even international lockdown.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:25:28):**  At that time as beekeepers we had special dispensation so we actually had you know official  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:25:35):**  emails from government bodies saying as beekeepers you can and should go and look after your  
**[0:25:41-0:25:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:25:41):**  bees.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:25:42):**  It's wild stock, it's animals at the end of the day that you're going to look after.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:25:46):**  It was actually quite a relief to be honest, it was like you know when everyone else is  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:25:50):**  stuck indoors we're actually allowed to go out beekeeping.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:25:52):**  I mean at the time to be honest in March I don't think anybody expected the lockdown  
**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:25:57):**  to last so long.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:25:59):**  I think at the beginning of Covid like most people we just thought it will probably last  
**[0:26:04-0:26:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:26:04):**  a few weeks and then everything will get back to normal and here we are six months later.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:26:10):**  We've definitely had to make some very swift changes to the way that people pick up honey  
**[0:26:14-0:26:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:26:14):**  for example so it's been a sudden learning experience I would say.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:26:21):**  We've had to learn how to do online sales quite a lot, we've had to set up our online  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:26:25):**  shop quite quickly, we'd have to arrange it so that people would collect bags of honey  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:26:30):**  from the door so we'd have to you know okay what time are you coming we'll leave your  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:26:34):**  bag at the doorstep.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:26:35):**  Which was odd because up until then people loved to have a little chat on the doorstep  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:26:39):**  and you know we loved to talk about where the honey came from and there were always  
**[0:26:42-0:26:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:26:42):**  lots of questions and this was quite clinical but at the same time I think a lot of our  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:26:49):**  local community and a lot of our newer customers that we gained actually appreciated the fact  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:26:55):**  that we were trying our best and you know we are in the middle of a pandemic safety  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:27:01):**  is obviously paramount and I think a lot of our customers did appreciate the fact that  
**[0:27:05-0:27:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:27:05):**  we were making the effort to make collection as safe as possible.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:27:12):**  But lockdown did have some benefits, not least for the bees.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:27:23):**  The one thing that we specifically noticed is even in our local area that every year  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:27:29):**  at a certain time of the year and usually unfortunately at the wrong time of the year  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:27:34):**  we'd get you know the local councils and people like that coming down and cutting the trees  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:27:38):**  down so you know how they've got this thing about pollarding the trees at certain times  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:27:42):**  of the year is to keep them small and usually they do that when the trees are at a stage  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:27:48):**  where it's most beneficial to the insects so they don't unfortunately take account of  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:27:54):**  what the best time is for the pollinators out there it's just what works for the schedule  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:27:59):**  that we have but this year what's happened is because a lot of people haven't been able  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:28:04):**  to get out and do the work that they need to one positive part of that is a lot of the  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:28:09):**  trees haven't been cut down a lot of the grassland has have been allowed to grow wild and nature  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:28:15):**  has flourished you know you're getting insects now which you probably haven't seen in a long  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:28:19):**  time which are coming back to certain parts of the country as well so you know if you  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:28:24):**  look at it from an insect point of view it's actually been very good for them the amount  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:28:29):**  of nectar coming in especially at the early part of the year was significantly more than  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:28:34):**  we would get in other in other years you know there's obviously other factors to take into  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:28:39):**  account you know the year started off nice and warm we had a good amount of rain but  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:28:44):**  even looking at similar years we've had in the past it's actually been a really good  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:28:48):**  year and I think a lot of that is to do with the fact that you know because people haven't  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:28:52):**  been out so much and they haven't been tearing down and making everything so nice and neat  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:28:58):**  out there it's actually been really good for the environment I think we've had some a far  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:29:03):**  larger number of weeds out there which pollinators love and that's that's had a real benefit  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:29:08):**  for the pollinators as well I've certainly noticed more butterflies far more different  
**[0:29:14-0:29:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:29:14):**  types of pollinators out there that you wouldn't normally see in your average summer because  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:29:21):**  of lockdown people have been allowed to go out for one walk a day so they are really  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:29:26):**  they were really taking advantage of that one walk a day so they were I think people  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:29:30):**  were appreciating their green spaces a lot more and I think when you appreciate your  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:29:34):**  green space you start to think about what you can do to help that green space I think  
**[0:29:39-0:29:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:29:39):**  people have consciously been planting more pollinator friendly flowers shrubs trees etc  
**[0:29:46-0:30:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:29:46):**  as well you know something has changed for the benefit of the bees.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:30:00):**  For people running small food businesses like Sky and Jane Angus and Salma and Khalil the  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:30:06):**  pandemic has presented huge challenges.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:30:09):**  They've adapted in inventive ways to keep their businesses afloat and continue serving  
**[0:30:14-0:30:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:30:14):**  their communities but many people have faced a far more fundamental challenge simply getting  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:30:21):**  enough to eat.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:30:23):**  The pandemic has heightened an already urgent crisis in access to food.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:30:28):**  In Sheffield one project sought to address this crisis by feeding people in multiple  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:30:33):**  ways.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:30:35):**  Just a heads up this interview includes brief references to suicide and abuse.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:30:41):**  My name is Ursula, Ursula Mairi and I am the Managing Director for ADIRA which is a survivor  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:30:47):**  led mental health and well-being service that supports black people with mental health issues.  
**[0:30:52-0:31:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:30:52):**  We are a bridge between the black community and predominantly white mental health services.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:31:00):**  I set up ADIRA to become that kind of beacon in the black community where people could  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:31:06):**  go for all those things services that were culturally competent sensitive and appropriate  
**[0:31:11-0:31:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:31:11):**  and led by people who look like them.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:31:19):**  People say oh mental health has increased because of Covid, nonsense.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:31:22):**  Mental health was there before Covid, pain and trauma and death was there before Covid.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:31:27):**  Covid has just exasperated it.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:31:32):**  When Covid hit a lot of people were losing the breadwinner in the family and were really  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:31:38):**  struggling and coming to me and saying Ursula I've got no food, I can't feed my kids and  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:31:42):**  I knew that I didn't even waste my breath saying or referring them to food banks because  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:31:47):**  I knew they would not go to a food bank.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:31:51):**  One because the people there are all white and two because the food is just not culturally  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:31:55):**  appropriate for us.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:31:58):**  I've known white people who have said look you know I'd rather die than go to a food  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:32:03):**  bank simply because of the connotations attached to those two words, food bank.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:32:09):**  Because food banks were started mainly to support people on very low income or on benefits.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:32:16):**  What black people there is that sense of because we have this statement in the black community  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:32:21):**  about you know you've got to be this strong black man, you've got to be this strong black  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:32:25):**  woman, maintain that image at any cost.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:32:29):**  Never let the white man see you needing help or wanting help and especially having to go  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:32:34):**  to him for help.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:32:36):**  So to be seen there is an embarrassment.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:32:40):**  So Ursula coined the term food pharmacy.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:32:43):**  You know when you have a child and the child is ill and they won't take the medicine so  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:32:47):**  you wrap it in a sweet and give it to them.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:32:52):**  That's where the word food pharmacy because I knew if I called it a food bank no self-respecting  
**[0:32:57-0:32:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:32:57):**  black person would come.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:32:59):**  First part of it what we did was we had cooked meals.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:33:02):**  So we had cooked chicken, rice and peas, plantain, fried fish.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:33:08):**  The people who couldn't come out because they were shielding or self-isolating or were elderly  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:33:12):**  knew that okay then the food that's going to be coming from the food pharmacy is food  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:33:16):**  that I eat because even something as simple as that can really affect a person's mental  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:33:21):**  health.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:33:22):**  You know it's not a case of oh god if you're that hungry you'll just eat.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:33:25):**  No it just doesn't work like that and especially for our elderly their body system is so used  
**[0:33:30-0:33:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:33:30):**  to a certain food it's like suddenly giving a person who's been a vegan for 30 years meat.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:33:37):**  You can mess up that person's system by doing something like that.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:33:41):**  So it's just not that black and white.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:33:44):**  Even though the food pharmacy was for the black community it was open to anybody.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:33:48):**  Anybody who wanted you know food and one of the cooked meals was for a Lithuanian family  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:33:53):**  who had been referred to us and they were so lovely god because they took the food it  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:33:59):**  was cooked and it was rice and peas and chicken and you know the father called us and he said  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:34:04):**  look you know thank you so much for the food but please don't deliver any more here because  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:34:08):**  we just can't eat it.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:34:11):**  We don't my kids don't like the texture they don't like the taste they don't like the  
**[0:34:14-0:34:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:34:14):**  flavours and I got so emotional because I completely understood absolutely completely understood  
**[0:34:21-0:34:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:34:21):**  why he and his family struggled with Jamaican food you know but I think for statutory services  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:34:30):**  it's just this is what we've got take it and if you don't then you're not really struggling  
**[0:34:36-0:34:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:34:36):**  then are you which is just not helpful.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:34:39):**  As Ursula says having access to culturally appropriate food is not a luxury.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:34:44):**  It's not about being fussy or ungrateful.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:34:48):**  Quite apart from the fact that being forced to suddenly radically change your diet is  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:34:52):**  physically disruptive it's mentally degrading as well.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:34:57):**  Culturally appropriate provision is about dignity and it's about understanding that  
**[0:35:01-0:35:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:35:01):**  physical health mental health and identity are intimately connected.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:35:07):**  In total over that time period for during Covid we fed over 4,000 people that's just  
**[0:35:13-0:35:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:35:13):**  going on by individual food parcels that didn't include because Adyra became a feeder the  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:35:19):**  food pharmacy sorry became a feeder for other organisations so for example we fed two refuges  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:35:26):**  and a halfway house for ex-offenders.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:35:31):**  That for me was my favourite part of running the food pharmacy because I was the one who  
**[0:35:36-0:35:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:35:36):**  initially reached out to the refuges because I used to be in a refuge 16 years ago and  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:35:42):**  the refuge that I first reached out to was the one I was in 16 years ago and it was a  
**[0:35:48-0:35:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:35:48):**  refuge where I was moved from London to Sheffield by police and social services and I basically  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:35:55):**  had a breakdown and didn't want to live anymore and the staff sitting there for two hours  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:36:00):**  trying to talk me down.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:36:02):**  I was in so much pain mentally and emotionally and psychologically I felt like an awful mother  
**[0:36:06-0:36:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:36:06):**  and I'd let my kids down and you know I lost everything and in that moment I couldn't see  
**[0:36:13-0:36:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:36:13):**  16 minutes ahead.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:36:15):**  If somebody had said to me just you know focus on the next 16 minutes I couldn't I just was  
**[0:36:20-0:36:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:36:20):**  in the second in the second literally so to be able to go back 16 years later and be able  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:36:28):**  to feed women who are now there who are now in that refuge who are now in that very very  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:36:34):**  dark place where I was 16 years ago.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:36:39):**  Oh it just means so so much to me.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:36:47):**  The thing that was beautiful was the first day I went there some of the staff who were  
**[0:36:51-0:36:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:36:51):**  there 16 years ago are still there so you can imagine the tears that day and what made  
**[0:36:58-0:37:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:36:58):**  it hard was that it was bloody corona so we couldn't hug or anything and that was just  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:37:04):**  like no because we just wanted to hug each other.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:37:08):**  I just wanted to hug those women because they saved my life 16 years ago and to hear them  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:37:15):**  say you know we know about Adaira we've heard about Adaira we've been following your progress  
**[0:37:20-0:37:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:37:20):**  since you left the refuge we are so proud of you we're so proud of what you've achieved  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:37:25):**  you survived suicide and abuse and all this and you've not thought well okay I've made  
**[0:37:29-0:37:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:37:29):**  it through off I go and live my best life you've chosen to come back and get other women  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:37:36):**  who are now in that position and help them through what you went through so oh god the  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:37:41):**  tears that day oh how we cried.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:37:46):**  The first hall we were renting was one of my old churches you know black churches everybody  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:37:52):**  in the church can cook so when we we put the call out and said look you know we're planning  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:37:58):**  to set up this food pharmacy and we need some cooks oh there was no shortage there was no  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:38:03):**  shortage what I love about the black communities we teach our men and our boys to cook so it  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:38:09):**  wasn't just women in the kitchen it was it was men as well that came and did the actual  
**[0:38:14-0:38:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:38:14):**  cooking and that was all from the church all the cooks were from that church.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:38:20):**  We'd have volunteer drivers who would come who were who were white and they used to say  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:38:24):**  you know coming there every Friday was like walking into a party because you know we'd  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:38:29):**  have our African music playing or our Jamaican music playing and the volunteers would be  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:38:35):**  young volunteers are all black could be dancing and you know we have such a laugh and it's  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:38:40):**  genuine it's not fake it's not because we're trying no it's genuine you know when I go  
**[0:38:45-0:38:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:38:45):**  there to collect the food we are doing dance-offs oh god yeah and to see some of these white  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:38:52):**  people dance god help me oh jesus and then when they're dancing with my volunteers it's  
**[0:38:57-0:39:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:38:57):**  just like no no no no no that please don't please stop you know it's just a real relationship  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:39:06):**  that I build up with these people so the food pharmacy in terms of been a success was absolutely  
**[0:39:12-0:39:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:39:12):**  brilliant and definitely needed for the black community.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:39:19):**  The food pharmacy was an amazing response to the immediate crisis but as we'll hear  
**[0:39:23-0:39:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:39:23):**  later in the series Ursula expects that many of those the pharmacy served will need ongoing  
**[0:39:29-0:39:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:39:29):**  support to access food.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:39:32):**  For the last decade food bank use in the UK has risen every year.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:39:37):**  From 2019 to 2020 the Trussell Trust an NGO that supports over half of the UK's estimated  
**[0:39:43-0:39:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:39:43):**  2,000 food banks they supplied 1.9 million emergency food parcels that's 74% more than  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:39:52):**  five years ago.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:39:57):**  This year the situation has got dramatically worse.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:40:01):**  In April 2020 food banks reported their busiest month on record.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:40:06):**  So how can we ensure that everyone has access to food and not just any food nutritious and  
**[0:40:12-0:40:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:40:12):**  culturally appropriate food?  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:40:15):**  This is a question we'll come back to throughout the series.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:40:19):**  The idea of dignity is something that's often absent from discussions about our food system.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:40:24):**  It feels like a distraction maybe an optional extra a nice to have but dignity has to be  
**[0:40:30-0:40:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:40:30):**  at the heart of our efforts to create a functioning healthy resilient food system a system that  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:40:36):**  really does serve everyone.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:40:40):**  That means the dignity of all the people in that system the farmers the farm workers the  
**[0:40:45-0:40:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:40:45):**  chefs the processors and you and me the people eating the food and it means the dignity of  
**[0:40:52-0:40:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:40:52):**  the other beings in the system as well the animals and the plants.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:40:56):**  As we'll hear throughout the series food is not just a question of calories.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:41:02):**  Food is nourishment for the body and soul.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:41:05):**  Food is about community culture and our relationship with each other and with the earth.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/who-feeds-us-episode-1-the-hungry-gap#t=0:41:11):**  We are all part of the food system.

**[0:00:00-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:00):**  At the bug farm we do a lot of research about general beneficial invertebrates.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:15):**  So those are the kind of invertebrates like spiders that will be carrying out pest control  
**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:19):**  in our crops, ladybirds who will eat aphids, parasitoid wasps that lay their eggs inside  
**[0:00:25-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:25):**  of aphids.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:26):**  The eggs then hatch and they eat the aphids from the inside out.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:29):**  Or maybe even hoverfly larvae.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:31):**  Hoverfly larvae are predators that will again feed on aphids.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:34):**  So what we want to do is we want to encourage these beneficial invertebrates at the same  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:38):**  time as controlling insect pests, which is difficult.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:43):**  And this is where things like off-crop habitat come in.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:46):**  So planting field margins with florally rich habitat, really, really important.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:52):**  But again, some farmers say, well, I've got small fields with big hedgerows.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:56):**  If I took another margin around the outsides, then I wouldn't have any field left.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:00):**  So I think this is where we look at trying to create patches.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:03):**  You know, those awkward corners that machines really can't get to.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:06):**  Leave those for wildlife.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:08):**  Any damp areas as well, really important for wildlife.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:10):**  What we also need as well is tussoky grasses because a lot of the invertebrates that benefit  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:16):**  us need tussoky grasses on which to breed.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:19):**  So a lot of butterflies, they need long grass stems to breed on.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:23):**  So many insects require this type of habitat.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:27):**  And lots of us have it already in our hedgerows.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:29):**  So what we want to do is to really improve the quality of hedgerows.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:34):**  Get away from the idea that we want them to look neat and take the top off every year.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:38):**  We're all slightly obsessed with neatness.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:40):**  Let them grow up.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:41):**  Let those hedgerows flower.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:42):**  The flowers will turn into berries for our birds in the winter.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:45):**  And look at all of the plants that grow at the bottom of hedgerows, your dead nettles,  
**[0:01:49-0:01:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:49):**  all your umbellifers, your cow parsley.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:52):**  They're all providing habitat for these beneficial invertebrates that not only inherently have  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:58):**  that diversity value but can help us as farmers save money.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:03):**  And the next step of research is how we get them to move from those habitats into our  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:07):**  crops at the time we need them.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:09):**  It's all very well if the hoverfly larvae come and munch on the aphid populations once  
**[0:02:14-0:02:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:14):**  the aphid population's already built up.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:16):**  How do we get them there soon enough that they can actually reduce the aphid population?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:20):**  And that's the kind of research we're doing.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:22):**  And that's what farmers need to know.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:23):**  If they're putting these agri-environment schemes measures, these conservation measures  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:27):**  in place, what benefits is it actually going to bring back to the farm business?  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:31):**  And that's where quantifying, putting a monetary value on invertebrates, however odd that seems  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:36):**  to me as a scientist to look at how everything else benefits us as one species.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:41):**  But when it's in a business situation, we need to do that.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:43):**  And then we can give those data back to the farmers and say, this is why we need to look  
**[0:02:48-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:48):**  after all the wildlife around us.

**[0:00:00-0:00:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:00):**  At the bug farm we do a lot of research about general beneficial invertebrates.  So those are the kind of invertebrates like spiders that will be carrying out pest control  in our crops, ladybirds who will eat aphids, parasitoid wasps that lay their eggs inside  
**[0:00:25-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:25):**  of aphids.  The eggs then hatch and they eat the aphids from the inside out.  Or maybe even hoverfly larvae.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:31):**  Hoverfly larvae are predators that will again feed on aphids.  So what we want to do is we want to encourage these beneficial invertebrates at the same  time as controlling insect pests, which is difficult.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:43):**  And this is where things like off-crop habitat come in.  So planting field margins with florally rich habitat, really, really important.  But again, some farmers say, well, I've got small fields with big hedgerows.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:00:56):**  If I took another margin around the outsides, then I wouldn't have any field left.  So I think this is where we look at trying to create patches.  You know, those awkward corners that machines really can't get to.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:06):**  Leave those for wildlife.  Any damp areas as well, really important for wildlife.  What we also need as well is tussoky grasses because a lot of the invertebrates that benefit  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:16):**  us need tussoky grasses on which to breed.  So a lot of butterflies, they need long grass stems to breed on.  So many insects require this type of habitat.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:27):**  And lots of us have it already in our hedgerows.  So what we want to do is to really improve the quality of hedgerows.  Get away from the idea that we want them to look neat and take the top off every year.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:38):**  We're all slightly obsessed with neatness.  Let them grow up.  Let those hedgerows flower.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:42):**  The flowers will turn into berries for our birds in the winter.  And look at all of the plants that grow at the bottom of hedgerows, your dead nettles,  all your umbellifers, your cow parsley.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:01:52):**  They're all providing habitat for these beneficial invertebrates that not only inherently have  that diversity value but can help us as farmers save money.  And the next step of research is how we get them to move from those habitats into our  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:07):**  crops at the time we need them.  It's all very well if the hoverfly larvae come and munch on the aphid populations once  the aphid population's already built up.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:16):**  How do we get them there soon enough that they can actually reduce the aphid population?  And that's the kind of research we're doing.  And that's what farmers need to know.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:23):**  If they're putting these agri-environment schemes measures, these conservation measures  in place, what benefits is it actually going to bring back to the farm business?  And that's where quantifying, putting a monetary value on invertebrates, however odd that seems  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:36):**  to me as a scientist to look at how everything else benefits us as one species.  But when it's in a business situation, we need to do that.  And then we can give those data back to the farmers and say, this is why we need to look  
**[0:02:48-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-invertebrates#t=0:02:48):**  after all the wildlife around us.

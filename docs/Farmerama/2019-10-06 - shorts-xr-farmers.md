## Shorts: XR Farmers  
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to this short episode of Farmerama. We don't usually do breaking news,  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:00:09):**  but we thought we should share this story with you right away. If you're in the UK,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:00:14):**  you may well see a bright pink tractor on the move over the next few days, and we wanted  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:00:18):**  you to be able to get involved if you're moved to.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:00:23):**  Extinction Rebellion is a global movement born in the UK, calling us all to tell the  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:00:28):**  truth about the environmental crisis we're in, and to hold the government to account  
**[0:00:32-0:00:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:00:32):**  on taking action in this climate emergency.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:00:36):**  Extinction Rebellion is not everyone's cup of tea, and I personally have stayed away  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:00:42):**  generally because they lead with a fear-based narrative to get people into action, and in  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:00:48):**  my opinion, if you start with a fear, then you breed more fear, and I've learnt that  
**[0:00:53-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:00:53):**  never really ends well.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:00:55):**  I think it's also been a struggle for farmers because there's regularly communications  
**[0:00:59-0:01:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:00:59):**  from Extinction Rebellion people that all animal farming is an environmental disaster,  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:01:07):**  and that we should all be vegan to save the planet. In my experience, this is not true,  
**[0:01:11-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:01:11):**  as all listeners of Farmerama know. It's much more about how we farm than what we farm,  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:01:19):**  and so I feel like a lot of the Extinction Rebellion arguments appeared to have missed  
**[0:01:24-0:01:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:01:24):**  some of the nuances of that. However, it can't be denied that Extinction Rebellion is having  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:01:31):**  a global impact, making people more aware of our negative impacts on the natural world  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:01:36):**  all around us, and so one farmer has taken it upon himself to bring positive farming  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:01:40):**  messages to the international Extinction Rebellion starting on Monday.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:01:45):**  My name's Dagan, I manage Broughton Water Buffalo in Hampshire, where we have a regenerative  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:01:51):**  farming system producing water buffalo meat, which we sell locally, and we also do a lot  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:01:57):**  of work for biodiversity and habitat. The discourse at the moment and the media criticism  
**[0:02:03-0:02:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:02:03):**  of farming is very destructive to, and stopping us finding ways to move forward and address  
**[0:02:10-0:02:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:02:10):**  these huge problems we've got with the climate and ecological emergency. I think, of course,  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:02:17):**  farming has got lots of problems like all other industries and businesses have, but  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:02:21):**  I think we need to acknowledge that farmers, many farmers are doing really great work to  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:02:25):**  try and make progress with all this, and I think also we've got to move away from blaming  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:02:31):**  people and criticising people, and we've got to get changes to happen on a big scale where  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:02:37):**  there's incentivisation for farming to change, and ways forward to make progress where we  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:02:42):**  can look after our soils better and our biodiversity as we move forward and try and take proper  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:02:48):**  steps to address the huge problems that confront us all.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:02:52):**  So what are you doing about it?  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:02:53):**  We've been farming regeneratively for 18 years at this farm with the buffalo, no inputs,  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:02:58):**  no chemicals, no antibiotics, planting loads of trees, creating lots of messy wild areas  
**[0:03:04-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:03:04):**  to build wildlife habitat, and that's been very good, you know, and we feel like we've  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:03:11):**  made good progress with that over the years, but we feel now with the way things are getting  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:03:17):**  so bad around us and around the world that we've got to do more, and so we are working  
**[0:03:23-0:03:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:03:23):**  with Extinction Rebellion, we've set up Exile Farmers, which is now in place and is going  
**[0:03:31-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:03:31):**  out there to deliver a very positive farming message and to concentrate our minds on the  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:03:38):**  things that farming can do to solve some of the problems that we've got ahead of us in  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:03:43):**  terms of wildlife and biodiversity, but also growing clean and healthy food and protecting  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:03:48):**  our landscape going into the future.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:03:51):**  So we set up Extinction Rebellion Farmers and we've bought a tractor which we've painted  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:03:56):**  pink and we've got a trailer which is going to take some people and some vegetables and  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:04:01):**  lots of positive messages up to London to join the rebellion next Monday.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:04:06):**  We're setting off tomorrow on Friday, we're going to go through the villages and towns  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:04:10):**  of Hampshire with our tractor convoy and we're going to be spreading this message as we make  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:04:15):**  our way up to London with the ultimate aim of getting ourselves to Westminster on Monday  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:04:19):**  morning to be there to spread positive farming messages and talk about the role of livestock  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:04:26):**  and the vital role of livestock in nutrient cycling and creating biodiversity and building  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:04:32):**  soil and growing good quality grass fed meat.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:04:37):**  And so we're going to be, if we get to London, we'll be able to talk about these things and  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:04:43):**  we'll also be able to go and pay a visit to Defra and we hope to be able to ask them to  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:04:49):**  put the issue of climate and ecological emergency at the absolute top of their agenda as they  
**[0:04:54-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:04:54):**  devise a new farming subsidy system or whatever they're going to do in the years to come after  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:01):**  we have left Europe.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:03):**  And so I think, you know, some of the Extinction Rebellion messages have actually been quite  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:08):**  anti-farming.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:09):**  Could you just comment on that?  
**[0:05:11-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:11):**  Yeah, that's true.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:12):**  I mean, that's one of the reasons that we set up Exile Farmers because I think Extinction  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:17):**  Rebellion has been slightly hijacked by the vegan movement and animal rebellion.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:22):**  The position of Extinction Rebellion is that they don't take sides on particular issues,  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:27):**  they're just trying to get their core demands met, which is to tell the truth on the emergency  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:32):**  and to get the government to act.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:35):**  And they do not take, specifically take the side of the vegans.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:40):**  They're trying to build this movement of movements where we get traction across society to get  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:44):**  pressure on government to act on all this stuff.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:49):**  We've actually been in quite a lot of conversations with animal rebellion to try and find ways  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:53):**  forward.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:56):**  Our ways forward obviously are very different from theirs, but in this state of extreme  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:05:59):**  crisis, we have to put our differences aside to get the government to act.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:06:04):**  We've also been talking to the people at Extinction Rebellion who acknowledge the role of livestock  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:06:11):**  in regenerative farming systems.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:06:14):**  And there are certain areas of livestock farming, obviously, dependence on soya, intensive systems,  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:06:20):**  huge waste problems and emissions problems.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:06:24):**  But that's a very separate thing from animals being used in grazing systems to achieve many,  
**[0:06:31-0:06:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:06:31):**  many, many ends on different levels.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:06:34):**  Well, there was that question about scale.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:06:37):**  And so could you maybe comment on the idea of what a good farm or a bad farm looks like  
**[0:06:43-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:06:43):**  and how you relate to other farmers in this?  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:06:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:06:47):**  So, I mean, I don't think scale is really a factor.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:06:52):**  A large farm or a small farm can be equally badly managed or well managed.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:06:58):**  I think we can constantly get lost in these little side arguments and discussions which  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:07:04):**  detract from the main issues that are confronting us.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:07:08):**  And so the issue of scale, it's not a problem.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:07:12):**  The issue is that we've got this massive dependence on fossil fuels and artificial inputs within  
**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:07:18):**  our farming systems, which is a result of the need to grow foods and historically from  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:07:25):**  the Second World War and the First World War, which put us in a certain position.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:07:29):**  But now with the knowledge and accumulated ways forward that now are being talked about  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:07:36):**  across the board in farming, these can be rolled out on any scale, on any type of farm.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:07:42):**  It's just that that's got to be able to happen.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:07:45):**  And that's got to happen with government leading on it and a government policy that takes all  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:07:50):**  this stuff properly, seriously, and enables farmers to transition to different farming  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:07:57):**  systems as we go forward.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:00):**  Brilliant.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:01):**  Okay.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:02):**  Is there anything else you'd like to kind of communicate around the XR farmers stuff  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:07):**  or, you know, many of our listeners are like new entrant farmers or small scale farmers,  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:13):**  both in the UK and around the world.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:15):**  Is there anything you want to share?  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:17):**  Well, I think sharing is the most important word in this.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:21):**  You know, I mean, I think what's got to be enabled is that farmers have access to better  
**[0:08:27-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:27):**  platforms of knowledge and skills that can be put out into the main farming community  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:35):**  and that we have an opportunity to see that there's different ways of moving forward with  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:40):**  farming.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:41):**  Change has to happen in so many different ways and on so many different levels and it  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:45):**  taps into our food supply system.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:47):**  And we've got to look at the amount of food that is being wasted and thrown away, both  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:51):**  in this country and globally.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:53):**  We have to look at the fact that there isn't a single answer and a single agenda that is  
**[0:08:57-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:57):**  going to solve all this.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:08:59):**  But by communicating and sharing knowledge and not blaming each other, we can use our  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:09:05):**  amazing human intelligence to find our ways out of this rather large hole that we seem  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-xr-farmers#t=0:09:10):**  to have fallen into.

## Shorts: Charles Schembre on Carbon Farm Plans & Monitoring Soils  
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:00:00):**  My name is Charles Shembrey. I work for the Napa County Resource Conservation District.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:00:10):**  My title here is Vineyard Conservation Coordinator. I'm basically a soil conservationist that  
**[0:00:17-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:00:17):**  works primarily in vineyard agriculture, but I do work in some grazing lands as well throughout  
**[0:00:25-0:00:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:00:25):**  Napa County. We're here today to talk about carbon farm planning. We produced, and me being the person  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:00:32):**  on staff, produced the first four vineyard carbon farm plans in the country here in Napa County.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:00:37):**  It's a typical conservation planning process going out, spending a lot of time with the landowner,  
**[0:00:44-0:00:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:00:44):**  the managers, whoever it may be, and just really opening up the full lens on this property of  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:00:51):**  looking at, number one, you want to start with resource concerns. So if there's riparian degradation  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:00:57):**  or any degradation on the land, how can we fix that? How can we alleviate that and improve the  
**[0:01:02-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:01:02):**  situation? There's always a carbon benefit. So we start with that and then we start looking a little  
**[0:01:08-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:01:08):**  bit more creatively, looking at ways that we can get large woody plantings or putting in some  
**[0:01:16-0:01:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:01:16):**  hedgerows. How do we want to improve the farm ecology through inviting more beneficial insects,  
**[0:01:23-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:01:23):**  creating more habitat for wildlife that would promote that ecology of the farm? How do we  
**[0:01:30-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:01:30):**  integrate all that? Start looking at other opportunities that may be energy related.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:01:37):**  So we can talk about the farming equipment or the approach of timing of things and how to  
**[0:01:46-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:01:46):**  even just reduce tractor passes. There's a lot of opportunity. We've looked at ways of integrating  
**[0:01:53-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:01:53):**  solar to power 14 pumps at a property before and the idea of removing vineyard that wasn't doing  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:02:02):**  well and building a solar farm. So really sky's the limit and each site's going to be very different.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:02:07):**  So it takes somebody who has a background and the open mindset to really look at all these  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:02:14):**  opportunities. You can be confined by just doing what the farmer thinks is feasible because there's  
**[0:02:20-0:02:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:02:20):**  this reality of financial commitment. But what we do, what I do and some of our other partners  
**[0:02:28-0:02:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:02:28):**  believe the same thing. We want to look at all the opportunity and provide that in the plan.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:02:35):**  Whether it's a little bit out of financial reality, that's okay. We want to create a plan  
**[0:02:42-0:02:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:02:42):**  that highlights all the potential. So and then from there we can figure out and chip away at a  
**[0:02:51-0:02:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:02:51):**  plan that is like economically feasible in the short term like five to ten year and then you  
**[0:02:59-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:02:59):**  can look at that ten to twenty, thirty, forty year outlook. And then the other big thing that we try  
**[0:03:06-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:03:06):**  to implement for the funding is soil analysis to look at soil organic carbon pools and organic  
**[0:03:13-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:03:13):**  matter and other soil health indicators like aggregate stability, looking at bulk density.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:03:21):**  So we want to look at that soil resource and see if there's opportunity to improve that. So if there  
**[0:03:26-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:03:26):**  is a lot of opportunity, you know, we can begin to discuss, you know, different soil practices  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:03:33):**  and especially looking at, you know, herbicide usage, how much ground cover, what's the photos,  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:03:40):**  what's the like full, you know, current state of photosynthesis on that property and how can we  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:03:47):**  maximize that. There's already been a carbon sequestration or greenhouse gas reduction  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:03:53):**  associated with most of these through the work that's been done at like Colorado State and they  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:03:59):**  produced another common common planner and common farm tool which are models that we can use and the  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:04:04):**  NRCS conservation practice standards are built in there. So the last thing I'm going to do is  
**[0:04:08-0:04:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:04:08):**  quantify the full carbon benefit and greenhouse gas reduction using multiple models and also local  
**[0:04:15-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:04:15):**  research that's been peer-reviewed. I don't get bogged down in the numbers. In fact, I think that's  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:04:22):**  the most irrelevant part of the whole process. We people want to look at the numbers and they want  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:04:27):**  to know like what's the numerical benefit of this, that that's impossible. Carbon, these systems are  
**[0:04:33-0:04:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:04:33):**  so complex, models are hypothetical but it gives us, you know, some kind of ballpark. People also  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:04:40):**  often say, you know, they're trying to do more and more research, more to prove like carbon is  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:04:46):**  going to improve soil or, you know, going no-till or getting more covers on the ground is going to  
**[0:04:51-0:04:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:04:51):**  improve and enhance carbon sequestration. It's like we, the models are there with already numbers  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:04:59):**  because that research has been done for decades. So, you know, I'm at a point personally and  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:05:05):**  professionally where I'm not interested in that conversation about the numbers behind it because  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:05:11):**  it's too complex. Like one farmer can plant cover crop A and the other farmer can plant cover crop  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:05:17):**  A and they both have the same cover crop but they have completely different ways of like managing  
**[0:05:20-0:05:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:05:20):**  their property. And so it's too dynamic but we have these models that can, you know, kind of put us  
**[0:05:27-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:05:27):**  in this like box of understanding. So, yeah, don't get bogged down on the actual sequestration numbers  
**[0:05:34-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:05:34):**  is my opinion. So we developed these plans, we just finished them up last year. So we're still looking  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:05:44):**  for implementation. This is all new, you know, like you might see articles and magazines and things  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:05:51):**  were coming out, you know, and I'm like I pretty much know every single person. I can count my one  
**[0:05:57-0:06:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:05:57):**  hand in the United States that's doing these right now. So it was kind of comical but so there are  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:06:04):**  like rangeland is ahead of the game right now on the West counties, Sonoma County, Marin, where they've  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:06:10):**  been doing this for five years and they're implementing and then you have Fibershed in  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:06:15):**  California. So they're working directly with their producer already, you know, implementing plans and  
**[0:06:22-0:06:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:06:22):**  getting benefits not just on the land but also in the product. With vineyards, we have folks who are  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:06:30):**  beginning to convert to no-till. That's kind of one of the first, you know, easy things to do that  
**[0:06:36-0:06:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:06:36):**  doesn't involve any financial commitment. Some are, you know, already implementing compost or putting  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:06:44):**  on more compost at least than they were historically and those benefits are, you know, still to be seen  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:06:50):**  because we've only really had like one year or they just are going to be coming into a lot of  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:06:54):**  their transition like this next fall. We've been doing this for about three years and we've seen  
**[0:07:01-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:07:01):**  some pretty large increases from large compost applications and biochar and enhancing our no-tillage  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:07:10):**  out there. I mean we're looking at soil organic carbon, soil organic matter, we're looking at soil  
**[0:07:16-0:07:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:07:16):**  organic carbon through the lab methodology of dry combustion. On dry combustion, that's the most  
**[0:07:24-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:07:24):**  accurate way of understanding carbon sequestration in the soil. We look at wet aggregate stability,  
**[0:07:33-0:07:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:07:33):**  we're looking at biological factors like CO2 respiration, potentially mineralized nitrogen,  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:07:40):**  we're looking at the active carbon pools, that labile carbon. These are really soil health  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:07:47):**  indicators. A lot of them have been identified by the Soil Health Institute as tier one indicators  
**[0:07:53-0:07:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:07:53):**  but for and there's more that we're looking at, you know, the physical measurements as well but  
**[0:07:59-0:08:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:07:59):**  for if you're looking at to monitor carbon you really only need to be taking bulk density and  
**[0:08:06-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:08:06):**  soil organic carbon. That's probably all you need. Oh and I would throw in wet aggregate stability  
**[0:08:13-0:08:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:08:13):**  because it is a I think one of the strongest indicators for the structural part of soil being  
**[0:08:20-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:08:20):**  improved and looking at that impact of you know water infiltration. You know we really value soil  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:08:30):**  health improvements and looking at carbon increases in the soil for improving groundwater recharge,  
**[0:08:37-0:08:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:08:37):**  for really getting stormwater to infiltrate into that soil and recharge subsoil moisture so that  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:08:48):**  we can reduce our water usage. I mean that's probably one of the biggest approaches in this  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:08:53):**  whole planning so I think they're interconnected. You know want to improve that water holding  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:08:58):**  capacity so we can measure those things. You know we can it's all it's all related but I mean just  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:09:04):**  to say again simply soil organic carbon you might as well you're going to get organic matter for  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:09:08):**  that if you're looking at that bulk density and wet aggregate stability would be my three simple  
**[0:09:15-0:09:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:09:15):**  measurements. The Healthy Soils Initiative is one of a kind. I think right now top my head I can't  
**[0:09:27-0:09:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:09:27):**  even explain how it came about but I you know I know that there was something passed in 2015 by  
**[0:09:34-0:09:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:09:34):**  the state of California. It was in 2016 we have the soil there's like some soil action plan of  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:09:42):**  California and this is where the soil through the soil health initiative was birthed the Healthy  
**[0:09:47-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:09:47):**  Soils Program essentially and that's where the funding is through that program to fund growers,  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:09:56):**  landowners around the state. So I think it's a great program and it's just evolving. You know  
**[0:10:01-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:10:01):**  there's been some things about it that some of us have disagreed with in the actual language of the  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:10:10):**  grant and the requirements behind it but CDFA has been pretty responsive to these comments and  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:10:16):**  they're starting to shift some of the requirements like the first round of funding they wanted the  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:10:22):**  compost application requirements were not consistent with or practical and you had to  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:10:31):**  apply compost at a certain rate for three years in a row every year and we we generally recommend  
**[0:10:37-0:10:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:10:37):**  compost applications on a much larger application and with a much larger interval so maybe like once  
**[0:10:45-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:10:45):**  every five years maybe even once every 10 years depending on the size of the application and some  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:10:53):**  of the soil monitoring that they were requesting to prove that there was carbon sequestration was  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:10:59):**  kind of unrealistic like they wanted it to happen every year so and again it's dynamic so it could  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:11:05):**  happen it might take three four or five years to see like a small response. You know it's just  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:11:11):**  interesting how the conversation shifts like we used to talk about like right before Trump was  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:11:17):**  hired that you know we could sequester carbon and mitigate climate change through soil management  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:11:23):**  and now like the USDA isn't allowed to use that kind of terminology because climate change doesn't  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:11:29):**  exist or something like that you know so I mean it's just I know that's the interesting thing but  
**[0:11:35-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:11:35):**  it is it is kind of the first time that it's been like recognized at a state level that this is a  
**[0:11:42-0:11:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:11:42):**  real tool for I guess mitigating climate change and that's pretty profound. Yeah we just get a  
**[0:11:54-0:12:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:11:54):**  little bit we don't do justice to this kind of work when we try to look at it just through one  
**[0:12:02-0:12:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:12:02):**  lens you know because we all we've understood for decades sustainable regenerative soil management  
**[0:12:10-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:12:10):**  practices and what it does to the whole ecological function of the land you know from storing water  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:12:18):**  to reducing erosion to enhancing crop productivity to providing habitat and clean water to animal  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:12:24):**  and people so that's really the lens that I'm going to continue walking down like it doesn't  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:12:29):**  need to be a climate lens or a carbon lens but it's about the whole system you know and I think  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:12:35):**  the healthy soils initiative is looking through multiple lenses I don't think it's just about  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:12:39):**  carbon but sometimes we get we seem to get caught up in talking about that but the healthy soils  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:12:45):**  initiative does state that climate solutions can occur through soil management like that that is  
**[0:12:51-0:13:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:12:51):**  known so that is certainly a focus and maybe it's the driving focus that I'm not I'm maybe a little  
**[0:13:00-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:13:00):**  reluctant to to have that focus but so. What I believe is that we have we're in a paradigm that  
**[0:13:15-0:13:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:13:15):**  we need to break out of and even some of us who feel like we're have broken out of that paradigm  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:13:22):**  we still have to step back and recognize that sometimes we're still looking through the a lens  
**[0:13:27-0:13:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:13:27):**  of like traditional farming since World War II you know what what what seems to be  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:13:36):**  the way it should look in particular we we tend to use our eyes to look at the land like in on  
**[0:13:42-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:13:42):**  the farm and things being clean cookie-cutted we have to step back sometimes and think about what  
**[0:13:49-0:14:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:13:49):**  is the end result and what does that mean and how do we shift our you know conditioning away from  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:14:01):**  that and and with our farm that we have I still do that every day I walk out there you know I have  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:14:07):**  to like hit myself in the head sometimes and go you know you go out there and you're just trying  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:14:11):**  to get things done it's like a day to day sometimes just got to stop and you think oh I got to mow  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:14:16):**  this and I got to do that and I got to do that and sometimes I stop and go but why why do I have to  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:14:21):**  mow that area over there and I start thinking about I'm like I don't need to mow that area I  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:14:25):**  can let that just be you know it's just this estate we want to keep things mowed and keep  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:14:31):**  things clean so biologically and like you're looking through the carbon lens you want to be  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:14:35):**  able to sequester as much carbon as you can you need chlorophyll to do that so if you mow something  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:14:41):**  down especially in California where by the way it doesn't rain for like five to six months out of  
**[0:14:46-0:14:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:14:46):**  the year as soon as you mow something it is kind of pretty much dead so um you know and just another  
**[0:14:54-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:14:54):**  quick example is that we've noticed that when you let grasses and other things grow quite tall the  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:15:02):**  do is like trap it captured and this is just anecdotally everything everybody wants things  
**[0:15:08-0:15:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:15:08):**  measured and researched but we see out on these properties where we let covers grow real tall  
**[0:15:16-0:15:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:15:16):**  that atmospheric moisture is condensing and that we find that the topsoil stays more moist in these  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:15:23):**  no-till environments and you have more biological activity as you get deeper into the season is  
**[0:15:28-0:15:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:15:28):**  warming up and you still have a lot of moisture that's actually being grabbed from the air so  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:15:35):**  just like redwoods do that you know they they've found that redwoods have the fog drip and we can  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:15:41):**  get that off of different covers so that's what I mean of opening that lens if you want to capture  
**[0:15:46-0:15:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/short-charles-schembre-on-carbon-farm-plans-monitoring-soils#t=0:15:46):**  carbon you've got to like think like carbon and so um I guess that's my long message there

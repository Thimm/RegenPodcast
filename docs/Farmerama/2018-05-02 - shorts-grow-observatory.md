## Shorts: GROW Observatory  
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to this special feature for Farmerama.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:00:08):**  The Grower Observatory is an EU-wide citizen science project helping people grow food and  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:00:13):**  care for their soils using regenerative practices. They do so through massive experiments using  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:00:18):**  low-cost soil moisture sensors and online courses.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:00:21):**  In this special feature, Nikos Francis speaks to Greek organic olive grower Pavlos Giorgiadis.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:00:27):**  He's one of the initiators of the Grower Observatory and he speaks to him from his olive farm in  
**[0:00:31-0:00:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:00:31):**  Alexandropoli to learn a little more about the project.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:00:40):**  We are on the north-eastern coast of Greece, on the coast of Thrace, in the village of  
**[0:00:46-0:00:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:00:46):**  Makri. Makri is a prehistoric establishment, a very old locality, and it hosts one of the  
**[0:00:56-0:01:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:00:56):**  last remaining traditional ancient olive groves in the Mediterranean.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:01:05):**  Right behind me is the Cyclops Cave, as the legend says, from the Homeric epic. And right  
**[0:01:11-0:01:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:01:11):**  in front of us, you can see the Thracian Sea extending from left to right. Right in front  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:01:17):**  of us is a small fisherman casting his nets right now.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:01:21):**  It's the beginning of November, we are really in the middle of the olive harvest, so there  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:01:27):**  is a lot of activity going on in the village. The village lives off olives, cultivating  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:01:33):**  a traditional local variety, really ancient genotype, and fishing. These are the main  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:01:40):**  two economic activities here in the village.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:01:45):**  I grow olives, I'm a fourth generation olive grower. We manage about 1500 olive trees,  
**[0:01:55-0:02:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:01:55):**  really big, large olive trees, really centuries old. And we are doing exclusively organic  
**[0:02:03-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:02:03):**  cultivation and 100% of this local native indigenous variety. And we have engaged in  
**[0:02:12-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:02:12):**  a path towards quality in the last five years. We made the transition to organic and being  
**[0:02:21-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:02:21):**  one of the youngest farmers, growers here in the village, we don't simply grow olives  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:02:29):**  and produce olive oil and table olives. We try to inspire a process of transition to  
**[0:02:36-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:02:36):**  the local community as well, trying to educate other farmers about organic techniques, techniques  
**[0:02:44-0:02:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:02:44):**  that preserve the soils, that allow growing without chemical fertilizers and pesticides.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:02:52):**  And we are now into a point in the sixth year, since I have taken up the management of this  
**[0:02:57-0:03:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:02:57):**  olive grove, that looks like that people are getting on board this new philosophy. There  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:03:09):**  are more and more trees and more and more land dedicated to organic cultivation, which  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:03:14):**  is obviously good for the village and the local ecosystem.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:03:20):**  So you also are one of the initiators of the Grow Observatory. Can you tell me a bit about  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:03:26):**  Grow and what is the idea behind it?  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:03:29):**  So in Grow we try to build a movement all over Europe, a movement of people who are  
**[0:03:34-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:03:34):**  passionate about the land and soil, who care about the future of life on Earth, who are  
**[0:03:45-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:03:45):**  growing the land with care, with care to the soil, care to biodiversity, care to consumers,  
**[0:03:54-0:04:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:03:54):**  care to the climate. Basically we try to inspire a massive community all around Europe where  
**[0:04:03-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:04:03):**  citizens will start becoming citizen scientists. And through the use of low cost sensing technologies  
**[0:04:13-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:04:13):**  they will contribute soil moisture data to the Grow Observatory. And this data will then  
**[0:04:20-0:04:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:04:20):**  be processed and analysed as an extremely powerful knowledge resource for the scientific  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:04:27):**  community, not only the soil sciences but also satellite science. But the hope is that  
**[0:04:34-0:04:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:04:34):**  this citizen driven data project will also be able to inspire change in policy when it  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:04:43):**  comes to land use management and natural resource management, especially in Greece this is very  
**[0:04:48-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:04:48):**  important because there are a lot of major data gaps when it comes to environmental monitoring  
**[0:04:55-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:04:55):**  and decision making is often, decisions are often taken without any evidence. So here  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:05:04):**  is a big opportunity for Growers, citizens to be able to generate their own data and  
**[0:05:11-0:05:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:05:11):**  provide evidence for better informed policy when it comes to environmental monitoring  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:05:19):**  and management. Which is obviously very very important, not only for Greece but particularly  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:05:23):**  for Greece as the country is located really on the front line of climate change. We are  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:05:28):**  one of the first countries in Europe that we already experience the effects of climate  
**[0:05:34-0:05:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:05:34):**  change mainly in the form of droughts, desertification advances very very quickly and in rates that  
**[0:05:42-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:05:42):**  are quite unpredictable and they are affecting the most vulnerable parts of the farming community.  
**[0:05:51-0:06:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:05:51):**  Greece is a country with 85% of its farmers being small scalers and this obviously generates  
**[0:06:00-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:06:00):**  large costs, large transaction costs but also risk. So the hypothesis behind Grow is how  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:06:07):**  we can bring all those people together, allow them to use new smart technologies, mobile  
**[0:06:13-0:06:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:06:13):**  technologies that exist in order to connect with each other, connect with the science  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:06:16):**  community but also connect with decision makers. So you mentioned that Grow is based on the  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:06:22):**  concept of citizen science, what is citizen science and what is different in this scientific  
**[0:06:27-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:06:27):**  method? Citizen science is an approach that tries to put the citizen in the centre of  
**[0:06:35-0:06:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:06:35):**  the scientific agenda not only as an object but also as a research partner. Land use management,  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:06:43):**  environmental management, climate change adaptation and mitigation are challenges that are too  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:06:49):**  large for any individual scientist or scientific institution to tackle on its own. What is  
**[0:06:56-0:07:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:06:56):**  needed is really interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary and international collaboration. So the problem  
**[0:07:04-0:07:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:07:04):**  is quite complex and it requires a very analytical response and obviously there is also a responsibility  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:07:13):**  for the citizens to jump on the but-wagon of this new understanding that we need to  
**[0:07:18-0:07:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:07:18):**  have over our ecosystems. So the idea is that citizens generate scientific data, data that  
**[0:07:26-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:07:26):**  is useful to science by following a given methodology that is provided by Grow but on  
**[0:07:34-0:07:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:07:34):**  return they receive incentives to continue generating and sharing this data. These incentives  
**[0:07:41-0:07:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:07:41):**  come in the form of personalised advice for their crops, in the form of community, networks  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:07:50):**  of networks of knowledge where people get together to exchange on farming techniques,  
**[0:07:57-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:07:57):**  ideas, concerns that they have about the land and in this way we are really trying to create  
**[0:08:05-0:08:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:08:05):**  a new movement into science as well. Nowadays there are ideas like open science that are  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:08:13):**  more and more advancing, solutions that are based on open data and these are the type  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:08:19):**  of solutions that the more people are engaged the more value they get and of course they  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:08:24):**  have a very strong engagement component because the challenge is how to make this process,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:08:30):**  the scientific process be owned by citizens. How can we place the citizen in a position  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:08:38):**  who is really able to also shape the research agenda where the research questions are not  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:08:44):**  only shaped by sponsors but also from the communities and the final beneficiaries themselves.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:08:50):**  And I think to a certain extent this can be really revolutionary when it comes to raising  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:08:54):**  awareness for environmental protection because when you own the solution then it becomes  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:09:01):**  part of your own personal interest to protect it and this is a really big challenge with  
**[0:09:07-0:09:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:09:07):**  GROW because GROW deals with soils and soils although we step on it, we step on the soil  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:09:15):**  every day, we depend so much on it for our food, for our medicine, for our clothes, for  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:09:20):**  our well-being, for wider environmental services, at the same time we are very ignorant about  
**[0:09:25-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:09:25):**  the soils. We are losing healthy soils much faster than we discover them and this is a  
**[0:09:32-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:09:32):**  unique opportunity with projects like GROW to raise capacity and raise awareness in massive  
**[0:09:40-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:09:40):**  scales and I think this is what is required and I think it can become really really powerful  
**[0:09:47-0:09:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:09:47):**  if we succeed to engage tens of thousands of citizens to follow GROW. So now we are  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:09:57):**  in Alexandroupoli. Alexandroupoli is one of GROW's first pilot places across Europe. How  
**[0:10:03-0:10:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:10:03):**  was Alexandroupoli chosen? Yeah, GROW starts this year with three pilot places all over  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:10:13):**  Europe. One of them is here in my hometown in Alexandroupoli which is right next to my  
**[0:10:19-0:10:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:10:19):**  village. One is in Hungary and one is in Ireland. The idea is that there was a need to launch  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:10:28):**  the project with actual communities in real life conditions but when talking about environmental  
**[0:10:34-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:10:34):**  monitoring we also need to grasp the diversity on climate and growing conditions across Europe.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:10:42):**  So having chosen Greece, Ireland and Hungary we have responded to this need to grasp diversity.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:10:48):**  On the other side myself I'm quite active here in the food movement. The last ten years  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:10:53):**  I have been championing the idea of agroecology and return to the land for more than ten years.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:10:59):**  I'm also involved as a professional grower in the last five to six years so there is  
**[0:11:04-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:11:04):**  a small community of other growers and citizens here in this region that are inspired by this  
**[0:11:15-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:11:15):**  message of transition and that was let's say the first access point to these communities.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:11:23):**  It turns out that this is becoming a really exciting and interesting encounter with people  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:11:31):**  that we know each other from but we get to know better as we interact more and more.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:11:37):**  We get to visit their land and taste their products and really get to understand what  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:11:44):**  are the struggles but also what are the unique points of growing in a place that is really  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:11:50):**  in the corner of the European Union. We are sitting right in front like Turkey is just  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:11:56):**  a few kilometres and we can see it across the sea. So traditionally this region has  
**[0:12:02-0:12:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:12:02):**  been a little bit lagging back in terms of innovation, in terms of opportunity and I'm  
**[0:12:09-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:12:09):**  particularly happy that GROW has provided a message of optimism and hope for this community.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:12:18):**  It's an opportunity to interact with very smart technology which are the sensing technology  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:12:23):**  we are offering but also the ability, the sense of belonging to a wider community that  
**[0:12:29-0:12:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:12:29):**  is working for the good. This is the first sensing mission of GROW and in 2018 we are  
**[0:12:39-0:12:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:12:39):**  planning to scale out in six other GROW places all over Europe so it will be a total of nine  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:12:47):**  where it will be a network of curated communities that will interact with each other, share  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:12:51):**  their data but also engage with GROW through online platforms and fora like the GROW forum  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:12:57):**  and the massive online courses on citizen science, on regenerative farming practices,  
**[0:13:04-0:13:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:13:04):**  on sensing technologies. So it's kind of a non-formal school taking place in the great  
**[0:13:14-0:13:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:13:14):**  outdoors and is made by people for people. So what are the benefits that GROW will offer  
**[0:13:23-0:13:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:13:23):**  to growers and communities that will take part? I've already mentioned some of the benefits  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:13:30):**  that exist for the scientific community, the ability to have a more analytical approach  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:13:37):**  in land monitoring and earth observation and there are also certain benefits when decision  
**[0:13:44-0:13:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:13:44):**  makers have more evidence in order to reach better and wiser decisions. The benefit for  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:13:51):**  a grower is that really for the first time he can have access, the grower can have access  
**[0:13:56-0:14:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:13:56):**  on validated information and advice on growing. The grower has access to some really interesting  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:14:07):**  tools for understanding better the soils. For the majority of growers out there, particularly  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:14:12):**  those that come from older generations, sure there is a lot of traditional knowledge that  
**[0:14:17-0:14:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:14:17):**  is gathered over years of encounter with the land. Unfortunately when it comes to the soil,  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:14:24):**  the soil is like a black box. It is something that we don't understand. Many farmers see  
**[0:14:29-0:14:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:14:29):**  it as inertia, as a dead matter. But the truth is that soil is a living ecosystem. We are  
**[0:14:37-0:14:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:14:37):**  talking about the living soil which is a movement that becomes stronger and stronger every day.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:14:44):**  So really the benefit for participants in GROW is the sense of uniting in a common cause  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:14:53):**  for the good which I believe is extremely important for today's Europe. There are a  
**[0:14:58-0:15:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:14:58):**  lot of things that separate us and the hypothesis we draw is whether the land and earth and  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:15:06):**  soil can be a unifying cause. But of course there are very large benefits when it comes  
**[0:15:11-0:15:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:15:11):**  to food production, quality food production, healthy food, nutritious food. When all this  
**[0:15:20-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:15:20):**  effort comes together and at some point becomes so big that has already shaped a new reality,  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:15:28):**  a reality that is based on agroecology, on permaculture, on urban gardening, on growing  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:15:33):**  rather than consuming. I think we are in a pivotal point right now in the history of  
**[0:15:39-0:15:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:15:39):**  mankind that we really need to put an unprecedented effort in front of the unprecedented challenge  
**[0:15:46-0:15:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:15:46):**  and really get together and work these things out. GROW is an amazing project that brings  
**[0:15:56-0:16:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:15:56):**  together some of Europe's leading scientists, food communities and public institutions that  
**[0:16:06-0:16:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:16:06):**  are willing to open up this process to the everyday citizen out there. And I think what  
**[0:16:13-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:16:13):**  we are looking at here can potentially be very strong and something very hopeful for  
**[0:16:21-0:16:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:16:21):**  the future. I think this is a very very big benefit for individual growers but also for  
**[0:16:30-0:16:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:16:30):**  the society as a whole. So what's coming next? Yeah we have another two years ahead of us  
**[0:16:40-0:16:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:16:40):**  at GROW. The big challenge is to get people informed and aware about the project, get  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:16:49):**  them understand what are the benefits but also what are the responsibilities in terms  
**[0:16:53-0:17:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:16:53):**  of generating credible, measurable data and sharing it openly. We are going to have nine  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:17:02):**  GROW places during 2018 all over Europe. These will be communities that will be coordinated  
**[0:17:08-0:17:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:17:08):**  by GROW but it will be self-organised in different localities. These are communities that are  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:17:17):**  located in rural areas, they are connected with innovation communities and ecosystems,  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:17:23):**  they are connected with local universities, they are aligned with local policies for environmental  
**[0:17:28-0:17:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:17:28):**  stewardship. So we are trying to bring all this dynamic together in the next year. And  
**[0:17:36-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:17:36):**  I have to say that it is a very very important learning process for us that we have conceived  
**[0:17:44-0:17:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:17:44):**  and implemented GROW. GROW is a project that looks amazing in paper, the design is quite  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:17:52):**  thoroughly thought but the actual interaction with the real communities is what really brings  
**[0:17:57-0:18:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:17:57):**  the real knowledge and the real experience. It is this attitude of learning that we as  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:18:06):**  researchers have which merges with the attitude of learning from the growers which I believe  
**[0:18:13-0:18:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:18:13):**  provides a very interesting domain for the knowledge economy. So what I want to, what  
**[0:18:22-0:18:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:18:22):**  I hope lies in the future is a little bit more awareness about the gravity of the challenge  
**[0:18:34-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:18:34):**  of soil degradation, a spirit of collaboration and unity to respond to the challenge and  
**[0:18:42-0:18:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:18:42):**  actually respond to it successfully and in a positive way. But also the opportunity to  
**[0:18:50-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:18:50):**  interact with thousands of growers that are thinking the same way I do and they are growing  
**[0:18:59-0:19:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:18:59):**  in a way that is respecting the land, is respecting the traditions of farming but also merges  
**[0:19:08-0:19:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:19:08):**  it with really high technology. I think this is really really inspiring, to place high  
**[0:19:17-0:19:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:19:17):**  technology sensors in an ancient olive grove, I think this is the key to a future that is  
**[0:19:25-0:19:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory#t=0:19:25):**  based on a healthy future.

**[0:00:00-0:00:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:00:00):**  Hello again, it's Joel here at the market garden at Harvest Barn Shop just outside Peterborough  
**[0:00:16-0:00:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:00:16):**  in Cambridgeshire. This is day 21 of week 7 of my time here at Harvest Barn Shop market  
**[0:00:26-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:00:26):**  garden. I'm only doing about three days a week, a little bit of time off. So it's looking good  
**[0:00:37-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:00:37):**  here on the market garden, still busy even though things are not growing that much. It was very cold  
**[0:00:47-0:00:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:00:47):**  last week, the last couple of days have been quite windy and it rained a lot today and the  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:00:54):**  winds calmed down now. Some things are not growing very much at all, other things like  
**[0:01:00-0:01:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:01:00):**  the Chinese mustard and the Komatsuna, the spinach, they've grown quite a bit and I'd say  
**[0:01:08-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:01:08):**  they would almost be ready to harvest. Harvesting is probably one of my weaknesses, something I  
**[0:01:15-0:01:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:01:15):**  don't know a lot about in terms of when is the best time and how much to harvest at a certain  
**[0:01:21-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:01:21):**  time. It's generally been going really well, I guess the big worry for me still is not knowing  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:01:30):**  who I'm going to sell to. The shop here is due to open, the farm shop is due to open on January  
**[0:01:36-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:01:36):**  the 4th so I could wait until then but if they have a slow start or if I've got more than they  
**[0:01:46-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:01:46):**  can sell it would be nice to know I could sell some leaves to other people and I haven't contacted  
**[0:01:53-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:01:53):**  anybody yet. So I'm doing all this work not knowing if I'll be able to sell anything and  
**[0:02:00-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:02:00):**  obviously if I don't sell stuff it will go to seed, be wasted and that will be quite disappointing.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:02:08):**  But things are looking healthy, they're growing well, I've just been over and re-weeded everything,  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:02:15):**  hoed and taken out and sort of couch grass that's still coming through so everything's looking very  
**[0:02:21-0:02:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:02:21):**  good. There is some minor pest damage on some of the leaves which could be due to I don't know  
**[0:02:30-0:02:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:02:30):**  beetles or probably not bird damage. I guess now the next thing I need to be looking at is planning  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:02:39):**  my crops for next year which is quite hard to do given that I don't know what's going to sell well  
**[0:02:44-0:02:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:02:44):**  here and how much to sow but I'll go for things like beetroot, radish, lots of salads, maybe some  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:02:54):**  beans and peas. I've just been putting garlic and broad beans in but some of those things don't make  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:03:00):**  much money so I've got to get a balance between what's gonna be in demand, what's gonna make most  
**[0:03:07-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:03:07):**  money for me, what's gonna do well in this situation and all of that will come with experience. I'd  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:03:15):**  like to get a polytunnel but that's expensive just trying to work out where that might go but  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:03:20):**  probably pretty essential for getting seed started and growing certain crops which I want to grow.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:03:26):**  So lots of things to think about. Generally I'd say I'm pretty pleased with the way things are  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:03:38):**  going. I think I'm happy with the bed system that I've got 15 meter beds by 30 inches that seems to  
**[0:03:44-0:03:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:03:44):**  work well in terms of sowing and marking out rows, stepping across beds. It's all quite practical and  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:03:54):**  easy. I have thought about bigger beds that some people seem to use meter-wide beds but I think I'll  
**[0:04:00-0:04:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:04:00):**  stick with this for the moment. I've just been at the Land Workers Alliance AGM which is great to  
**[0:04:07-0:04:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:04:07):**  hear people talking about all their different projects, lots of ideas. I've got to try and focus  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:04:14):**  on a few things rather than get carried away. I was talking to some people about seed saving,  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:04:20):**  that would be great to do but perhaps a bit too much to think about in the first year. Maybe try  
**[0:04:26-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:04:26):**  one or two varieties. Some big news is that I have upgraded from my tent to a caravan. I was in a tent  
**[0:04:36-0:04:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:04:36):**  when I was staying here until last week. That was pretty cold, I think it was minus one or minus two.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:04:44):**  The caravan is a bit more cozy and more spacious and it means I can sit somewhere out of the  
**[0:04:50-0:05:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:04:50):**  wind in the evening even though there's no electricity. But that's fine, step by step,  
**[0:05:00-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:05:00):**  things are getting a bit more practical and easier. Not much to report other than that in  
**[0:05:08-0:05:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:05:08):**  terms of exciting news. Farming life goes on and I spend most of my day on my own out in the field  
**[0:05:20-0:05:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:05:20):**  and stop for a cup of tea and chat to the people who are getting the shop up and running. Go for a  
**[0:05:31-0:05:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:05:31):**  swim in the evening, get some chips one evening a week. So it's a fairly unexciting life but  
**[0:05:41-0:05:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:05:41):**  hopefully when the shop opens and spring comes there'll be a bit more people around and life  
**[0:05:49-0:05:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:05:49):**  on the farm which will be nice. Anyway thanks for listening, I hope this is interesting and  
**[0:05:59-0:06:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-harvest-barn-market-garden-update#t=0:05:59):**  it will be great to hear people's comments and feedback about what I'm doing. Thanks, bye.

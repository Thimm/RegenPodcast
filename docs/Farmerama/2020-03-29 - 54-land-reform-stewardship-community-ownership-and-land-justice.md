## 54: Land reform, stewardship, community ownership and land justice  
**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to episode 54 of Farmerama.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:00:13):**  We're recording this on the 25th of March. Here in the UK, the coronavirus outbreak has  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:00:18):**  upended supermarket supply chains. And around the world, farmers are finding themselves  
**[0:00:23-0:00:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:00:23):**  forced to adjust to a rapidly changing marketplace and a lot of uncertainty. With drastic measures  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:00:30):**  now in place to control the pandemic, it already feels like a kind of new normal is forming.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:00:35):**  And that people who are used to taking our food systems for granted are starting to realize how  
**[0:00:40-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:00:40):**  fragile they can actually be. It's a difficult and distressing time for everyone. And our thoughts  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:00:47):**  are with all of you. If there's anything we at Farmerama can do to help you, then please do let  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:00:52):**  us know. At the same time, we're cautiously hopeful that this experience will highlight  
**[0:00:58-0:01:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:00:58):**  just how vital farming and farmers are to everyone's lives. For now, we're not out in  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:01:05):**  the fields reporting, but we do have a lot of interviews stashed away in the hopper.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:01:10):**  So we'll still be bringing you stories from the front line of regenerative farming.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:01:15):**  The farming community is incredibly resilient. And around the world, we've seen many fantastic  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:01:20):**  examples of farmers and growers coming together with the food and hospitality industry, as well  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:01:26):**  as the charitable sector, to create and strengthen local supply chains and ensure no one goes without  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:01:32):**  food. Here are just a few we've got in touch in the last few days. Hello, Farmerama listeners.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:01:38):**  This is Gala. I work at Plour Hatch Farm on the East Sussex, West Sussex border. Hello, it's Fred  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:01:46):**  from Gothany Farm. It's a beautiful sunny morning in Somerset. My name is Monica Acrest and we farm  
**[0:01:51-0:01:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:01:51):**  in the East Sussex. The sun is shining, the ground is beginning to dry up. I've got that kind of  
**[0:01:58-0:02:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:01:58):**  real sense that spring's in the air now. Peas have stopped rooting. They're much, much more grazing  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:02:04):**  now and before long we'll be putting them back on the herbal lace. That is my absolute favourite time  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:02:08):**  of the year. Something to look forward to. And the fields are finally starting to dry out, which means  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:02:12):**  we might be able to get some crops in. We didn't manage to get our autumn crops in.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:02:17):**  And we're about to head into lambing. Last week or so's flown by, I guess, since I heard the restaurants  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:02:24):**  in London would be shutting their doors. And initially, I guess, fairly selfish stresses about  
**[0:02:30-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:02:30):**  flows of cash and pigs. On the shop side, on the selling side, it's all been really, really hectic.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:02:38):**  And having to adapt very fast to this new place we find ourselves in. You know, we've been absolutely  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:02:43):**  at capacity just trying to serve people and keep the shelves stocked. We need to figure out how we can  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:02:50):**  best serve our community, whilst being realistic about it. I think farmers are a fairly sensible  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:02:56):**  breed anyway. When you're out on your farm interacting with animals rather than humans,  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:03:02):**  you're not quite the same risk as if you're travelling on the underground in London, are you?  
**[0:03:08-0:03:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:03:08):**  So it's maybe an advantage to be part of a rural community. We need to make sure, first and foremost,  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:03:18):**  that our staff are healthy so that they continue to work. Otherwise, nobody's getting any food.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:03:24):**  Although the farming calendar waits for no one, let's all take these social distancing measures seriously.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:03:29):**  Hello!  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:03:36):**  So we can protect our loved ones and get back to normal as quickly as possible.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:03:40):**  What I find extraordinary is how the value of food has changed overnight.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:03:46):**  You know, people are suddenly desperate to have their eggs. And yeah, we keep trying to sort of  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:03:52):**  impress upon our customers that the cows are milked every day and the chickens lay eggs every day.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:03:58):**  And they're not going to stop. Already people are beginning to rally around. The bakeries that we  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:04:04):**  usually supply grain to, like Landrace in Bath, Rye Bakery in Frome, Coombshead Farm, Farrow in Bristol,  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:04:10):**  they've all been so quick to fill their customers' baskets with all manner of locally farmed goodies.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:04:15):**  We're very lucky that this crisis is hitting now and we're going into the summer and there's going  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:04:20):**  to be so many lovely things to eat. And I guess that's the strength of these small supply chains.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:04:26):**  And manned by friendships and we're all in it together, we've got each other's interests so  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:04:31):**  close to our hearts. And we're agile. We're able to adapt quickly.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:04:36):**  In a way to be hit with this realisation that supermarkets aren't the be-all and end-all is good for us smaller farmers.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:04:45):**  People realise that localised food systems are more resilient, I suppose, in these strange times.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:04:55):**  And the coming days and weeks will give me and my customers more space to be creative and innovative  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:05:01):**  and get our food out there in new ways.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:05:05):**  I think we're all very grateful here to have the rhythm of the farm and all the day-to-day  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:05:13):**  things we have to do to look after the animals and the plants and soil, of course.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:05:18):**  The reassuring routines of farm work and life have been the tonic.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:05:23):**  Yeah, I mean, the sun's shining. I think a lot of us could cry with gratitude that the sun is shining  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:05:30):**  because it was a really, really challenging winter.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:05:34):**  The sun's shining. Carry on farming.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:05:46):**  This is our second episode digging deeper into stories from the Oxford Real Farming Conference,  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:05:52):**  where we were the official media partners.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:05:54):**  This month, we're exploring what it means to own or to steward land as part of a regenerative farming future.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:06:01):**  We're fascinated and encouraged by the many different ways people are approaching this issue.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:06:06):**  And at the end of the show, we'll share an exciting new opportunity for you to get involved in a shared land ownership model.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:06:16):**  Land reform is an emotive subject, but in the last few years there seems to have been more and more  
**[0:06:21-0:06:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:06:21):**  talk about how we might innovate.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:06:24):**  In the farming community, we all know that land justice underpins everything.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:06:29):**  Those who have land wield more power and of course also have more responsibility.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:06:35):**  Neither feels quite right on either side.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:06:38):**  We're going to hear from current and aspiring land stewards about their approaches to land reform.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:06:44):**  First, here's Molly Scott Cato.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:06:47):**  Until recently, Molly was a Green MEP for South East England.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:06:51):**  You might have seen her rather tearful goodbye to the EU when the UK left at the start of this year.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:06:57):**  When we spoke to Molly, she'd just come out of a session with other political parties.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:07:02):**  They were discussing how they might approach land reform in a way that both ensures the land is well cared for  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:07:07):**  and addresses long-standing injustices around its ownership.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:07:11):**  As a Green, I think of land as a commonwealth and I don't think it's appropriate really for anybody to own land  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:07:19):**  rather than have certain rights over land for a certain time.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:07:23):**  And particularly it's not right that we have vast amounts of our land controlled by private estates.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:07:29):**  Really an aristocratic land regime and that's keeping a lot of people out of farming  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:07:33):**  who could otherwise gain access to that land.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:07:36):**  So it's a sort of massive source of injustice that we tend to take for granted.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:07:40):**  Land is a common treasury and that's an old idea.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:07:43):**  And we've challenged the enclosures that happened in the 16th century onwards  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:07:49):**  whereby the right that everybody has to grow food and to graze animals on land  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:07:53):**  was sort of taken away and major and large estates were created.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:07:58):**  Vast swathes of our countryside has just been passed down from generation to generation of aristocratic families.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:08:05):**  And now we also see people who've made wealth in their own lifetimes whether through banking or,  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:08:10):**  I mean, James Dyson's the most notorious example,  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:08:12):**  those people put their money into land so that they can then pass it on tax-free to their descendants.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:08:18):**  So we're seeing, you know, long-term concentration of land for perhaps a thousand years  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:08:23):**  but also now more land being taken up and concentrated.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:08:27):**  And then people who want to actually farm that land and produce food for us all,  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:08:31):**  they now have to pay rent to people who are not paying tax.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:08:33):**  So the whole kind of economics of land is skewed in favour of a small number of people.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:08:39):**  These have seemed like radical ideas but they've been radical ideas that have always been part of our  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:08:44):**  intellectual discussion and our political discussion and I think it's really good to see them being revived.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:08:49):**  And I think the reason that's happening is that with climate change  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:08:53):**  we know that the most important role that land can play is as a carbon sink  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:08:57):**  and we need to find ways of making sure that happens whatever the individual landowner might think.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:09:02):**  And so it kind of revives that suggestion that we need to have more of a say as the public  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:09:09):**  over how land is used and also have a land reform so more people have access to land.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:09:23):**  Ninian Stewart is co-founder of the Centre for Stewardship  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:09:27):**  and comes from a very long line of landowners in Scotland.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:09:31):**  There have been significant land reforms this century in Scotland  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:09:34):**  including the introduction of Right to Rome but Scotland also has very large swathes of land  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:09:40):**  owned by a small number of individuals. Ninian is one of a number of people  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:09:45):**  looking to move the idea of ownership towards one of stewardship.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:09:50):**  By chance at Falkland we are living and working in what was an ancient seat of the Stewart kings  
**[0:09:58-0:10:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:09:58):**  for 200 years and the Stewart kings before they became kings and queens were in fact stewards.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:10:06):**  So the notion and the word stewardship is an Anglo-Saxon word which originally meant  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:10:13):**  kind of keeper of the hall but in a sense it was the hall at the heart of a community  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:10:18):**  and stewardship has been moved to being I suppose the idea of looking after things for others  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:10:25):**  and for the long term. The farm at Falkland has been in Ninian's family for hundreds of years  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:10:31):**  but ever since he took it over Ninian hasn't quite managed to wrap his head around the idea of  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:10:36):**  owning land. As a teenager my dad had been I suppose what you would call in Scotland a benevolent  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:10:42):**  layered and I kind of thought I don't know if I want to be you know just didn't feel right.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:10:47):**  I've struggled for a long time as to how can you own land, how can you own a hill,  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:10:52):**  how can you own a forest you know it's a funny concept that we've come up with.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:10:57):**  So I've been working with my two children I didn't want to disinherit my children without them being  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:11:03):**  involved in that so between the three of us we absolutely consciously want to move it on  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:11:08):**  into a different form of ownership. So at the moment we're exploring what that wider sense  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:11:13):**  of ownership might look like and I suppose over the last probably gosh it's probably the  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:11:19):**  charitable trust was set up 25 years ago. We had initially entered into a lease on the estate with  
**[0:11:26-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:11:26):**  a guy called Bruce Bennett who initially took on two acres of land and started a small holding.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:11:33):**  He now has 20 acres of land and employs 30 people and has a farm shop and a cafe and yeah the first  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:11:42):**  organic farm cafe in Scotland. About five and a half years ago we set up a new farmer scheme when  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:11:48):**  the first publicity went out we had about 24 people in the room who wanted to do that.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:11:53):**  And in practice four people came on board pretty quickly in fact there happened to be two couples  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:11:59):**  and there is now a third unit so people who have up to two hectares of land.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:12:05):**  So one is called Falkland Kitchen Farm Nat and Brydie and what they do is they grow vegetables  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:12:12):**  but they also Nat is also a cook and so they kind of add value by also doing kind of catering  
**[0:12:18-0:12:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:12:18):**  and all of that. And the other one Medusweet Organics they do a range of vegetables but also  
**[0:12:25-0:12:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:12:25):**  herbs and the initiator the sort of co-founder of that Rosie is a herbalist. So in a sense they're  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:12:33):**  still there five years on and we've now entered into a second five years with both of those  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:12:40):**  entities and that's been really exciting it's kind of been just lovely what happens when you open  
**[0:12:44-0:12:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:12:44):**  the gate to people to be able to kind of come in and give them enough space to take ownership really.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:12:52):**  But the challenge now is to say and how can we really long term sustain that and what does that  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:12:58):**  mean how does how to widen that circle of not just widening the circle of stewardship but also widening  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:13:04):**  the circle of ownership. Partly when you're considering of moving on the ownership there's  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:13:09):**  something about how much of a vision you can bring to it and how much you need to enable and allow  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:13:15):**  that vision to evolve. But I think we've been working for a number of years with a number of  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:13:20):**  stakeholders around the estate as to what it might look like. So I think in some ways the estate is  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:13:26):**  moving in a direction where it's going to be quite diverse. We've been focusing not just on farming  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:13:31):**  but also on forestry so we have a thousand acres of forest within a four thousand acre estate.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:13:37):**  We are doing a lot of things so on the farm for instance we have a wood miser a mobile sawmill  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:13:44):**  so we kind of use that for doing some fencing but also for building huts and all of those things.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:13:50):**  So there's that layer. There is horticultural growing we have some land which is good enough  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:13:55):**  for horticultural growing. A lot of the land is hill land and not that great and so we have  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:14:01):**  a beef herd we have Aberdeen Angus and Belted Galloways and so we've been developing those  
**[0:14:08-0:14:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:14:08):**  breeds and to a point where yeah we can kind of develop and sell food for people. And I think what  
**[0:14:17-0:14:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:14:17):**  we don't quite know is for instance beyond the new farmers as they were and who will have kind of  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:14:24):**  had 10-year leases is where we go with that. So I think at the moment one of the things we are  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:14:28):**  looking at is for instance joint ventures. Sometimes it makes sense that for instance  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:14:33):**  the home farm might be able to get more kids so then can you do joint ventures with different  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:14:38):**  people who come in and do different things. I think what was coming up yesterday what I do  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:14:42):**  think is valid and needed is how when you're trying to go a little bit against the tide try to  
**[0:14:48-0:14:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:14:48):**  go in a different way where can you get support to do that because I suppose from where I am there's  
**[0:14:55-0:15:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:14:55):**  been a real there's a need for change as we make these changes. For me I think there's probably a  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:15:02):**  need for some kind of peer support and you know I think in Scotland Scottish Land Commission have  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:15:08):**  been very helpful in advisory and you know there are bodies who can offer you that support if you're  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:15:13):**  trying to take things in a slightly different way.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:15:15):**  Sebastian Parsons of the Stockwood Community Benefits Society is also a landowner doing things  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:15:21):**  differently. He's been working with a number of organisations to take his own family farm into  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:15:26):**  community ownership in a way that's working for both his family and for the farm's new investors.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:15:32):**  So my story goes back 35 years. My grandfather was selling his farm. He had my mum and then three  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:15:44):**  sons and he'd offered each son a partnership and he hadn't got on with them and bought a farm.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:15:50):**  So he had a very good relationship with his family and he was very good at it. He was very  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:15:57):**  good at it and he'd offered each son a partnership and he hadn't got on with them and bought them out.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:16:03):**  It never occurred to him that my mum was the farmer. Anyway after he bought the last one out  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:16:08):**  he was old enough to retire and he said since none of you are going to take it on I'm going to sell  
**[0:16:12-0:16:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:16:12):**  it but you've got a chance now to put something to me and they didn't manage to put something  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:16:20):**  together. I think the siblings would have done but not with the partners taken into account.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:16:26):**  The land was worth so much money and everybody had different plans and different ideas and  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:16:31):**  different visions and they couldn't agree. It was one of the first two biodynamic farms in the UK  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:16:38):**  and there was when my grandfather said he was going to sell it there was a big fundraising  
**[0:16:42-0:16:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:16:42):**  campaign and they raised over 400,000 pounds to buy it and in fact it was sold to an oil magnet  
**[0:16:50-0:16:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:16:50):**  for 650. But the fact that there was such an effort to raise money to save it signaled to me  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:16:58):**  that it was an important farm and that something really awful had happened when it was sold.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:17:04):**  My sisters and I didn't talk about it but when we grew up we all carried the same sadness  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:17:10):**  and we ended up in business together and we ended up being successful and what we did with our  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:17:16):**  success if you like was we bought a farm. What we realized was we'd bought a farm so we sort of like  
**[0:17:22-0:17:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:17:22):**  retrieved the balance you know there was another biodynamic farm in the world now but what would  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:17:29):**  happen to it? Why wouldn't the same thing happen? Why wouldn't we fall out and if we didn't fall out  
**[0:17:34-0:17:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:17:34):**  why wouldn't our kids fall out? And we basically we hatched this plan to put the farm into a  
**[0:17:42-0:17:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:17:42):**  community trust and to be the farmers as tenants so as long as we wanted to be the farmers we would be  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:17:52):**  and if we didn't want to be the farmers we just walked away the trust would handle it we wouldn't  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:17:57):**  have to have a row. So there's a farm business which my family still owns and a farm that my  
**[0:18:03-0:18:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:18:03):**  family still runs owned by 400 people who have bought shares because they believe in what we're  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:18:10):**  doing they want us to do it. It's something that people get more than just money out of  
**[0:18:18-0:18:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:18:18):**  and from our perspective we are still a family farm and we've just got a lot more people around  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:18:27):**  us who are interested so it's we think of it as a warmth body you know it's like the community that  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:18:32):**  supports us. This question about power and land and autonomy and so on is very difficult because  
**[0:18:39-0:18:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:18:39):**  farmers are very autonomous you know they're their own men or their own women they walk about  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:18:47):**  in their on their own kingdom but with that ownership comes this huge asset value which  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:18:53):**  makes everything go twisted and wrong so as a family what we had to decide was what's our most  
**[0:18:58-0:19:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:18:58):**  important thing and our most important thing is that we can farm you know that the land is respected  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:19:06):**  that the land carries on and nobody's going to chew it up and change it you know and that river  
**[0:19:11-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:19:11):**  is going to babble through this land unpoisoned by our land forever you know the kingfisher isn't  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:19:18):**  going to be driven off the land we're going to have this ecosystem it belongs to this land  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:19:23):**  nobody's going to take it away from the land so all of these things are important to us  
**[0:19:27-0:19:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:19:27):**  so a tenancy means that the owners of the land don't control the farming  
**[0:19:34-0:19:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:19:34):**  the farming is controlled by the farmer that's the autonomy we need we need to be allowed to farm  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:19:41):**  the autonomy that we don't need is we don't need to be able to sell it  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:19:46):**  and we don't need to be able to build houses on it what we need is to have land that we look after  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:19:53):**  that we bring our children up on that we farm  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:19:56):**  by creating different models of land ownership we've got an opportunity to address historical  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:20:01):**  and ongoing injustices and to make land ownership and stewardship serve all communities

**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:21:11):**  land justice and the future of land ownership in the uk and beyond my understanding is that the  
**[0:21:18-0:21:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:21:18):**  first big spike in co2 was in the 1800s when colonizers plowed the great plains and released  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:21:25):**  half of the carbon from the soil into the atmosphere you know a couple generations before  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:21:30):**  the industrial revolution put that next big spike and so if we were to actually convert like all of  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:21:36):**  the lands that are currently cultivated into afro-indigenous farming practices if we you know  
**[0:21:42-0:21:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:21:42):**  land in permanent silvopasture do perennial rich polyculture agriculture make african dark earth  
**[0:21:49-0:21:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:21:49):**  and vermi compost like we've been taught terracing all of those technologies which have existed for  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:21:56):**  thousands of years and have been continued to be approved upon we actually can sequester the carbon  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:22:00):**  that we need and restore the atmosphere to health the angle at which i come out from is the work  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:22:06):**  that we're doing is seeking to restore those practices that leah's talked about in terms of  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:22:11):**  looking at engaging with the land in a new and different way in ways that do not degrade the  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:22:16):**  land but in terms of reverence for the land and in reverence we we we take care and we  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:22:24):**  hold it dear to us and widely climate justice could start to consider these sort of things  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:22:30):**  like the wider dynamics of like our society so not just in terms of the things that we identify  
**[0:22:36-0:22:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:22:36):**  as scientific issues but also you know the racial element and like the politics and the gender the  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:22:43):**  redistribution of of land from the commons to the wealthy i think there's a social element that we  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:22:49):**  have to consider of like why is it that these dynamics are so such that we're in a crisis  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:22:54):**  the thing with british colonialism is like it was very insidiously violent in the sense that  
**[0:23:00-0:23:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:23:00):**  it didn't occur on this land like we don't have necessarily a direct claim my great great great  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:23:07):**  grandfather farmed here but the disruption that occurred in the land that we do come from  
**[0:23:12-0:23:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:23:12):**  therefore gives me that right to this land we didn't come here by mistake we were forced here  
**[0:23:19-0:23:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:23:19):**  by a displacement that sort of the angle which we now start to look at are sort of right here  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:23:26):**  like this is our home many of us can't go back to places that we've been and i think the ancestry  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:23:32):**  or the roots begins now obviously it's very different in the united states because a lot  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:23:35):**  of the bloodshed happened right there you know and the you know the bodies of our ancestors  
**[0:23:41-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:23:41):**  came from nigeria and from ghana togo and benin and came there and so i can trace a lineage back  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:23:48):**  and i know that my grandmother brownlee mccullough was the last to be able to farm the land in rock  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:23:54):**  hill south carolina because of air property exploitation and so i can trace back that land  
**[0:23:59-0:24:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:23:59):**  loss and so there's also there's a a source of belonging in that but also the pain is right in  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:24:06):**  front of us and so i think the particular way that trauma impacts the black community in the united  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:24:11):**  states is very related to to that recent story like my grandmother my great grandmother was  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:24:17):**  a sharecropper was picking cotton or was you know beats in at this tree and so that um  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:24:22):**  um egophobia and that um sense that the land really was the criminal in some way is is quite  
**[0:24:29-0:24:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:24:29):**  clear and present in the black community you know people that feel a certain stigma with the land  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:24:36):**  if we're trying to introduce them back to the land it's like we need to do in ways that are  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:24:40):**  culturally relevant in ways that remind them of a sense of remind them of a time that they  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:24:45):**  felt happy so for instance if they as a kid used to farm somewhere in nigeria you know they've long  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:24:51):**  been removed from that and there's a lot of trauma of i don't want to get my hands dirty  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:24:55):**  that's poor people's work i don't want to do that etc what are the ways in which we can then you  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:25:00):**  know reconnect them with that and there's like there's song song is a very useful way of doing  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:25:05):**  and i think also connecting people to the foods that they eat culturally and that's just one way  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:25:10):**  one of many ways which we can end stigma and really like get people to just open themselves  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:25:15):**  up to the land there is a clamoring to come back to the land which surprised even me for those who  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:25:21):**  do have resistance which is totally understandable it's usually one of two things that work like one  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:25:26):**  is being exposed to a different narrative about our connection to land not being circumscribed  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:25:31):**  by slavery but really be extending thousands of years you know before that and all the contributions  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:25:37):**  and this pride that can come but then also for a lot of young people there's this like almost  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:25:42):**  spiteful resistance when they realize that corporations are just out to kill them by pumping  
**[0:25:46-0:25:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:25:46):**  their bodies full of these you know corporatized highly processed foods that sense of so that  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:25:53):**  survival instinct comes up and they're like i'm not going to let them destroy my life they've  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:25:58):**  already you know taken all these things from me i'm not going to let them take my life and so we  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:26:01):**  need to reclaim our connection to food i will say that the land does most of the work you know if we  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:26:06):**  can get folks to a place where they're over the hump of fear and they get to make that introduction  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:26:11):**  to the land as soon as the barefeet her hands touch the earth she like claims her children home  
**[0:26:15-0:26:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:26:15):**  but honestly like folks want it it's just that the resources aren't always there you know at oofc lion  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:26:22):**  held their first caucus the activity we did we basically asked people in the room to think about  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:26:27):**  the resources that they could possibly offer to aspiring land stewards in people of color in the  
**[0:26:33-0:26:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:26:33):**  uk um also what kind of legacy do they want to leave and in terms of succession it was powerful  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:26:40):**  because i think we have inside of us this this desire to give but not until we're asked but there  
**[0:26:46-0:26:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:26:46):**  was this buzz at the end and i think people felt inspired and people felt like they did come and  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:26:53):**  you know make a difference or something or they did show up in some way i felt inspired in many  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:26:59):**  ways by the conversation i think most notably uh you know this conference was open by reminding us  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:27:04):**  that the empire wins by making us feel that we're alone and that's certainly the case in the uk with  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:27:10):**  black farmers and farmers of color who you can probably count you know on the official record on  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:27:14):**  two hands if that right so it was really in maybe less right so it was really inspiring to me i feel  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:27:20):**  like in that room we were witnessing part of the birth of a movement i feel like this moment i'm  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:27:25):**  getting to witness like the birth of the uk black and brown farming movement um which is very exciting  
**[0:27:31-0:27:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/54-land-reform-stewardship-community-ownership-and-land-justice#t=0:27:31):**  so

### The Natural Lifestylist Podcast  (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 07:53:08)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:00:00):**  Hi, I'm Tony Riddle and this is the Natural Lifestylist podcast.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:00:06):**  So way back in December I had this crazy idea to run from Land's End to John O'Groats in  
**[0:00:11-0:00:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:00:11):**  just 30 days.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:00:12):**  But I wasn't just going to run it, I was going to run it barefoot to raise funds for environmental  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:00:17):**  charities and collaborate with world leading experts to raise awareness and money for six  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:00:23):**  organisations fighting the top sustainability issues of our time.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:00:28):**  I knew running barefoot would raise many a socially extreme eyebrow and with that eyebrow  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:00:32):**  raising behaviour I would be able to provide a perfect platform to highlight the importance  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:00:37):**  of connecting with our environment and those key sustainability issues of our time.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:00:43):**  It gives me great pleasure to introduce you to Richie Norton, aka the Strength Temple.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:00:51):**  I first met Richie at a dinner that We Move magazine had put together and we instantly  
**[0:00:56-0:00:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:00:56):**  hit it off.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:00:57):**  To be fair, there's not a lot to not like about Richie, so hitting it off is a no brainer.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:01:04):**  Richie is an ex rugby player turned yogi, surfer, adrenaline junkie.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:01:09):**  He's spent the last 10 years working alongside sports professionals and some of the most  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:01:13):**  respected pioneers of human performance.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:01:16):**  And what has grown out of this is Richie's own unique blend of meditation, breath work  
**[0:01:20-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:01:20):**  and yoga.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:01:21):**  I'm so aligned with what Richie is putting out into the world so it gives me great pleasure  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:01:26):**  to be able to share this relaxed chat with you.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:01:29):**  Richie shares an insight into his own journey of self discovery and provides some simple  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:01:34):**  yet potent tools to unlock and develop physical and mental wellbeing.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:01:38):**  I hope you enjoy the chat.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:01:49):**  So I'm here with Richie Norton, Richie aka the Strength Temple and I'm so pleased this  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:01:54):**  is happening.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:01:55):**  It's been one of those days when it's probably more important than ever to have Richie here.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:01):**  Richie's great at taking people through the process.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:03):**  I've had just one of those couple, well it's not one day, it's a couple of days where things  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:09):**  just haven't quite panned out how I thought they were.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:14):**  I personally know I can go into the cave, into the pain cave.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:18):**  I know I have tools that help me get out the pain cave, which I know Richie has some great  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:22):**  tools.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:24):**  So this is taking off the path of what we normally perceive sustainability from me.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:29):**  I wanted to talk to Richie about being a sustainable human in what can be, like what I've experienced,  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:36):**  stressful situations and things that kind of take us off the path and that we can have  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:42):**  tools that help us process the path and get back on it so we can continue.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:47):**  Which for me is the path is just being present.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:50):**  So how do we get back to the present moment?  
**[0:02:52-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:52):**  So that's kind of why I wanted you on the show man.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:54):**  I'm calling it a show now, can you believe it?  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:56):**  This is the Tony Riddle show.  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:58):**  The Tony Riddle show.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:02:59):**  We're back on the show.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:00):**  I think you should have a show.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:02):**  Oh let's do a show man.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:03):**  We know enough people to have good chats.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:05):**  We do huh?  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:06):**  We have loads of good chats and create a show.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:08):**  So Richie's here.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:09):**  Hello Richie.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:10):**  Hi mate.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:11):**  Thanks for having me along.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:12):**  It's cool.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:13):**  I'm glad we could make it happen still.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:14):**  Yeah, we had a run booked in didn't we?  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:16):**  We did have a run.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:17):**  We've been training for months.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:18):**  Richie was all fired up for a run and then he put it out there, he's like I don't want  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:22):**  to run.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:23):**  I don't want to run.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:24):**  And then Tony's ankle got blown out.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:25):**  No it didn't.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:26):**  My wish came true now.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:27):**  Of course not.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:28):**  So for those that don't know, my foot swirled up, my left foot swirled up.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:32):**  It made me throw over to my right foot.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:34):**  I've worn the pads out underneath my foot.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:36):**  It's too excruciating.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:37):**  I've taken a couple of days out so we're resting.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:40):**  So it's still a 30-30 challenge.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:41):**  I'm just going to have to do more mileage at the end.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:44):**  Richie gladly came on so he's here for an interview.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:48):**  Cool.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:49):**  You might still sneak in a run maybe.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:50):**  We may.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:51):**  If I end up up north where you'll end up.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:52):**  Yeah I mean that would be great.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:53):**  Maybe that will still happen.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:54):**  Yeah the healing process.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:55):**  I'm putting it out there.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:03:57):**  So Richie, ex rugby player, yogi, XPT, mindfulness, breath work.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:04:07):**  What else is there to Richie?  
**[0:04:09-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:04:09):**  How did you find all this Richie?  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:04:11):**  Many layers.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:04:13):**  Well a big part of it has been coming across you actually.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:04:17):**  Thanks to the We Move guys putting us in alignment through the We Move podcast.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:04:23):**  Oh because we met at the dinner didn't we?  
**[0:04:26-0:04:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:04:26):**  We met at the We Move dinner.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:04:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:04:29):**  Since then it's been a real connection with you.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:04:35):**  You've been a big part for me to actually step out of my comfort zone and to align with  
**[0:04:42-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:04:42):**  I think where your journey has also taken you especially talking about the medicines  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:04:49):**  and the transformations and the lessons and the journey and what it's given you and what  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:04:54):**  it keeps giving you.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:04:55):**  I know I've confined it in you with a lot of that that's helped me structure my next  
**[0:05:02-0:05:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:05:02):**  steps but without going deep into that the background for me is coming from rugby and  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:05:10):**  starting at a very young age thinking that was going to be my future, my career and the  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:05:16):**  wear and tear that put on my body physically, mentally, emotionally and the pressure and  
**[0:05:21-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:05:21):**  when that got taken away because of injury and feeling powerless and not being able to  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:05:29):**  carry on what I thought was going to be my biggest journey, my biggest achievement and  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:05:34):**  relating to where we are now it's a real blow.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:05:38):**  And you're derailed that way because did rugby become like the personality view as well?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:05:43):**  100% it was my outlet, it was everything for me, it was life.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:05:47):**  I was struggling with a lot, rugby was my outlet, training, physical, challenges, social,  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:05:55):**  everything I was going down wrong paths and I realised I had more to give and more to  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:06:00):**  offer but I really didn't know how to communicate it and didn't know how to channel all the  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:06:05):**  energy and all the frustration and anger and all this confusion and the short version is  
**[0:06:10-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:06:10):**  I found my way into breath work, yoga, meditation years later after really losing my way.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:06:17):**  And it seems that there's such polarity to rugby doesn't it?  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:06:20):**  I don't know why but rugby and mindfulness and breath work and yoga seems like such poles  
**[0:06:25-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:06:25):**  apart don't they?  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:06:26):**  If you'd have said to me when I was playing rugby one day you're going to be a yoga teacher  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:06:31):**  and you're going to teach kids and adults how to breathe and how to be more mindful  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:06:36):**  about how they exist and live a more sustainable existence, I would have laughed or just thought  
**[0:06:42-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:06:42):**  you were bonkers.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:06:44):**  So how did that ignite though?  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:06:47):**  How was that moment between the breakdown of rugby, how did you discover the breath  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:06:53):**  work?  
**[0:06:54-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:06:54):**  Do you know what I mean?  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:06:55):**  So it was a really intricate journey over a few years.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:07:00):**  I went to Sydney, I moved to Australia when I was 30 years old because it was my last  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:07:05):**  window to get that Australian working visa and I thought this is my way out of it, this  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:07:09):**  is my way out of the UK.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:07:12):**  I needed a change, I felt like I was just destroying myself grinding in London and I  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:07:18):**  went to Australia and I thought well I'm in Australia I'm going to learn how to surf because  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:07:23):**  that looks like fun, don't come to Australia and not try and give it a go.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:07:28):**  And I committed to a routine of like I've never had a routine, I've not had a routine  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:07:31):**  in a while since I stopped playing rugby, my body felt pretty broken, I wasn't really  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:07:34):**  functioning very well, I stopped training the gym, put on a bit of weight, lost purpose,  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:07:39):**  lost direction and going back into nature, getting in the ocean, getting smashed a lot,  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:07:45):**  almost drowning a few times but what I learnt from that was resilience and persistence and  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:07:50):**  got fit and healthy and then off the back of that I met a girl, as you do, a single  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:07:56):**  guy in Sydney, came across a beach babe and she was a yoga teacher and put a different  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:08:02):**  spin on yoga, she's like you know just go and have a little vibe in my class, it's very  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:08:07):**  playful, we just move and we breathe and I was like okay that's a different delivery,  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:08:12):**  I'm going to go and give it a go and all of a sudden what I thought was loads of shapes  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:08:17):**  and meditations and chanting and you know lycra and lots of women in a yoga class where  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:08:23):**  I already felt intimidated, she gave it a different language and I connected with it  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:08:28):**  on a very different level, breathing became part of how I moved and the tempo of how I  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:08:33):**  went through class so it was at my pace and yeah the next chapter again while I was in  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:08:40):**  Sydney I had to go to a Brazilian college that it was like, dare I say a loophole but  
**[0:08:47-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:08:47):**  it was more a really interesting subject, capoeira, where you'd learn, you get a diploma  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:08:55):**  in capoeira and Brazilian martial arts. Which is really playful again right? Playful, it  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:09:01):**  really spoke to me and also you came away with a coaching course on how to teach kids  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:09:08):**  and the elderly and how to communicate with other people to give them really easy instruction  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:09:14):**  to be able to get them to do some physical exercise but what was tied in with that was  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:09:19):**  this capoeira practical exam that you had to do over this year period while you were  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:09:24):**  on this course. So I started doing capoeira and I started going to yoga and these Brazilians  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:09:28):**  that I was studying with also went surfing at the weekend and had barbecues on the beach  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:09:32):**  and they had brought in community and it was all about community and I just thought wow  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:09:37):**  I feel amazing. I'm not surprised at how many physical boxes you've took there right? Or  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:09:41):**  social physical boxes right? Yeah. That's incredible. And then all my injuries went  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:09:45):**  away, this was the big thing. All the aches and pains and the niggles that I'd been played  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:09:50):**  with that stopped my rugby career going any further, all of a sudden they weren't there  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:09:55):**  anymore, I could move better, I could move quicker. I started to play rugby again. And  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:09:59):**  I wonder how many of those, the emotional attachment to them as well. Big, big. I found  
**[0:10:04-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:10:04):**  a whole new like vibe of life. Surfing got better, I was moving more like fluidly, I  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:10:13):**  was moving in different directions and different planes of motion and like speaking more confidently,  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:10:19):**  more empowered because I felt like I got my power back because I'd reconnected with the  
**[0:10:23-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:10:23):**  things that I was completely disconnected with. And yeah, life began again and I realised  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:10:32):**  I'm going to try and find a way of communicating this to other people that are in my position,  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:10:38):**  rugby players, athletes. I think most human beings today man, I mean it can be people  
**[0:10:43-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:10:43):**  just understanding that it's to find a purpose again isn't it? To find a purpose or some  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:10:50):**  out there might not even realise there is a purpose, you know? Yeah. So often it takes  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:10:55):**  a breaking down to realise there is a purpose. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? To reconnect  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:11:00):**  with it, reignite something. Definitely. And then also you then have the tools as you've  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:11:06):**  gathered to help the others. Big time. I think some of my biggest inspirations and some of  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:11:11):**  the most amazing stories that I've heard have come from people that have overcome struggle,  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:11:17):**  that have hit a dark moment of life or overcome adversity and become more resilient and more  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:11:24):**  empowered and more aware and how that is a gift when you look at it that way to be able  
**[0:11:29-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:11:29):**  to inspire other people. And I went there and I feel like I've been able to align and  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:11:36):**  attract and see and connect those people now because I've seen pain in other people and  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:11:40):**  suffering in other people and wanting to empower those people to see that as a superpower because  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:11:46):**  you have that insight into knowing how to build strength and resilience to overcome  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:11:52):**  physical changes, challenges, emotionally, spiritually and that can come through changing  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:11:57):**  your diet, changing your lifestyle, changing your environment, changing your friend circle.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:12:01):**  Or even just removing the fear of adversity. Do you know what I mean? Changing the relationship  
**[0:12:06-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:12:06):**  with it completely, isn't it? Yeah. This is going to come at some stage to all human beings.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:12:13):**  And we live in such fear of it. Where sometimes leaning in is where you're going to really  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:12:19):**  face what's actually there in front of you, talking to you, communicating to you that  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:12:25):**  you're either suppressing or hiding from. Whereas that's there for you to learn and  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:12:31):**  to be able to move into that next chapter. It's the honesty and the humbling experience  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:12:34):**  of adversity that teaches us the most, right? Lean in. And you know, that's where your growth  
**[0:12:40-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:12:40):**  will come. So yeah, I made myself, made my way back to London as a personal trainer and  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:12:48):**  was very lucky to not have to go and work in big mainstream gyms. I just realised I  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:12:52):**  had this mission, I had this knowledge, I had this insight and I thought, so aligned  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:12:56):**  the UK wasn't really where I was. You know, the gift of Australia was they were so far  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:13:02):**  ahead for me in my eyes with food, nutrition, exercise, outdoor lifestyle and how powerful  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:13:08):**  that was. And I came back to London and I felt like I was surrounded by zombies and  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:13:14):**  robots going through this repetitive cycle. You know, going to gyms, lifting weights for  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:13:20):**  aesthetics and just smashing weights with no real idea why.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:13:24):**  In a just all linear.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:13:26):**  Including, you know, not just general public, but professional athletes and the conversations  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:13:30):**  I'd had with people. It was so like strange for me to have these very open chats about  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:13:36):**  intricacy of how do you mobilise your body and rewild yourself to be more in tune with  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:13:41):**  how your body's working for you. So it all worked better for you because of how you breathe  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:13:46):**  and the way you move and align simple movement patterns. And they were like, what are you  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:13:52):**  on about? Yeah, I mean, you're a professional athlete. The more in tune you are with yourself,  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:13:58):**  more mindful you are about your movement and what you eat and how you behave and how you  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:14:02):**  speak will directly affect the way you feel and the way you perform.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:14:07):**  How successful you become as a human being. Yeah. Just an athlete. Yeah. So when I realised  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:14:11):**  it was it was, you know, so new to a lot of people, I realised this was where I was going  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:14:16):**  to be able to add value. And that was a few years ago now. I've been on a bit of a wild  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:14:20):**  journey through there and did my yoga teacher training in Bali with one of my most amazing  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:14:26):**  friends, Ian Finn. He was over recently. He was over recently in London. And he just had  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:14:31):**  a birthday. Yeah. Yeah. Birthday. And it was a real special day to connect with him again.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:14:37):**  And he's just an incredible human with the ability to look at the individual and go,  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:14:42):**  I'm going to use this language because I see that's where you're going to make a connection  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:14:46):**  with this. And for me, I've embodied that. That's quite a skill set. That's the coach's  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:14:51):**  personality, isn't it? It's like, well, you might not want to be a yoga teacher. You might  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:14:56):**  not want to be a spiritual guru. You might not want to be a teacher or a coach. But we  
**[0:15:01-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:15:01):**  all have this gift to be able to help each other and to inspire others based on our ability  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:15:09):**  to be connected with ourselves and to have this extra strength and resilience to maybe  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:15:13):**  help other people through challenges. And when I want to try and educate people on mobilization  
**[0:15:19-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:15:19):**  and moving a bit better and be more connected with yourself and your family and the environment,  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:15:26):**  you've got to go a bit more inward. And my journey has been very similar. But for me  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:15:32):**  to go and teach a yoga class and use Sanskrit names and traditional yogi words, I didn't  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:15:37):**  connect to yoga that way. My connection to it was I'm going to move my body and breathe  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:15:42):**  and have my own practice based on what my body wants to do in that moment on that day.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:15:46):**  And that's what saved you as well. And that's what saved me because I was able to slow the  
**[0:15:50-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:15:50):**  pace of life down and I was able to see nature differently. I was able to like feel aches  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:15:57):**  and pains that were bothering me that I wasn't addressing. I was ignoring it, suffering a  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:16:02):**  little bit better with it rather than actually going, oh, my back is really feeling tight  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:16:07):**  here. That's given me anxiety. It's given me stress. I'm not moving properly. That's  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:16:10):**  frustrating me. I'm not sleeping very well, but I'm ignoring it. Whereas, well, you're  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:16:15):**  not, you're never just ignoring it. That's the point. Because we start using pacifiers  
**[0:16:18-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:16:18):**  to deal with the ignorance of the symptom. Yeah. Yeah. So I thought, well, this is what  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:16:26):**  I'm going to do. I'm going to search out people that I relate to. And I realize actually I  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:16:32):**  have a similar story. And I bet I can learn something from their journey. Yeah. But along  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:16:38):**  the way, I'm just going out and connecting with these people, just having conversations,  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:16:44):**  enlightening people, sharing topics like we are now to bring awareness to whoever's watching  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:16:50):**  this to maybe go, actually, I need to maybe give that some attention and just giving them  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:16:55):**  that little nudge, maybe giving them a little bit of insight, education to get them up and  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:17:01):**  moving and thinking about the things that really matter because I think there's a lack  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:17:05):**  of perspective on what's really important. Well, it's powerful, isn't it? Because I was  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:17:09):**  stopped on the run by a guy called Stuart Botting. This dude rocks up in his VW, bright  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:17:15):**  red VW transport in a campervan style thing. He's just standing in this country lane with  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:17:20):**  his arms out and I'm running towards this guy. And I'm like, who is this? He's like,  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:17:26):**  hi, I'm Stuart. Hi, Tony. And then as I get closer, he says, I realize you don't know  
**[0:17:30-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:17:30):**  me, but I feel like I know you. And then we chat and we start talking about how he was  
**[0:17:37-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:17:37):**  in a dark space, right? And through following me, through following you, then he got into  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:17:46):**  Rich Roll, then he said, oh, then I found you on Rich Roll, which is amazing. I put  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:17:49):**  two and two together and here I am, I'm on the path. But I was in this dark space and  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:17:54):**  by doing morning rituals, by doing breath work, by doing mobility, by doing ice baths, by  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:18:00):**  turning to a plant-based diet. And now I'm into barefoot. My son and I walk around barefoot  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:18:06):**  and my daughter calls us the barefoot warriors, right? And he just had this glint in his eye  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:18:12):**  and you could see he's transformed, right? And he's transformed through social media  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:18:18):**  because that's the tribe, right? That's where we're pushing content out into. So it's not  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:18:23):**  just meeting the individual or putting the class on, there's that tool as well now, isn't  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:18:27):**  there? To open up the space, which is like doing massive festivals. You have a huge following,  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:18:33):**  right? Imagine that it's like doing a talk to 58,000 people if they're all listening.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:18:38):**  Do you know what I mean? And he had, do you know what his glint was? I said, you've got  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:18:42):**  an amazing glint in your eye, man. What's going on? He said, well, I just get up and  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:18:47):**  I know what I'm doing now. I start with a routine, I have a routine. And I was like,  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:18:51):**  oh, you found purpose then? He's like, yeah, I think I found my purpose. And he said, for  
**[0:18:55-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:18:55):**  a man, a family man with kids to find purpose again has been one of the most powerful gifts  
**[0:19:02-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:19:02):**  he could find. You know? How old was he? I'd say he's probably 50, you know? Young. So  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:19:10):**  much potential, so much opportunity. Potentiality there is like whatever he wants it to be.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:19:15):**  That's what I love about it. When you tell me those conversations, I think, well, how  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:19:20):**  can I share that with my dad? Because I know he would love, you know, the opportunity to  
**[0:19:25-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:19:25):**  maybe do something different. He's outgoing, he's looking for the next thing, you know,  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:19:28):**  he's got time on his hands. How do you inspire people that are maybe looking for something,  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:19:33):**  but don't quite know where to start and just give them that little nudge and, you know,  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:19:37):**  to get going? Well, I think you keep doing what you're doing, Richie. Do you know what  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:19:41):**  I mean? That's what it seems like. Yeah. And especially for parents, right? It's like,  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:19:46):**  they don't want to be told by their own kids how to behave, but they're observed their  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:19:50):**  behavior because they're their kids. So rather than being told, it's just be. And then once  
**[0:19:55-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:19:55):**  you be, then people see. And then the C turns into we, something else. I like that. I love  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:20:02):**  that. That was good. You had that recording. Yeah, man. I'll turn that off. Write it down.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:20:09):**  I'm glad you brought up the whole Rich Roll thing as well. He, I mean, he was one of the  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:20:14):**  third podcast I ever came across when I got into the whole podcast space. Big, really  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:20:19):**  like his vibe. Yeah. Really hope I get to meet him one day and amazing guy. He's an  
**[0:20:24-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:20:24):**  incredible guy. I was listening to him on the way down here actually. And one guy sent  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:20:31):**  me a video message yesterday, the power of social media. And I do, I've got a great relationship  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:20:36):**  with social media. Now at one point I lost my way with it and my relationship wasn't  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:20:40):**  very positive. It was a bit like, and this guy reached out to me very in a very vulnerable  
**[0:20:46-0:20:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:20:46):**  way, ex-military and he had something happened to him and he, and he at the right time at  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:20:53):**  the right moment, because I'd put content out at a time when he was listening to Rich  
**[0:20:57-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:20:57):**  Roll, your podcast checked out, you followed, you found me. And one word that came out of  
**[0:21:05-0:21:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:21:05):**  my post one day, the day after, because he just found me resonated with him. And that  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:21:11):**  gave him the confidence to go, I've never shared this with anybody. And he shared, and  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:21:17):**  I sent him a voice note back straight away. He lives in the US and, and he just needed  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:21:23):**  to like have a soundboard to be able to express something that had been pushed down and suppressed  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:21:29):**  because he felt completely stuck. And for me having these conversations where I love  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:21:33):**  it so much and I get quite emotional and the whole thing is that's how powerful this can  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:21:36):**  be. If you're there to do good. And if you're there to create a message, you're there to  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:21:41):**  inspire other people, whatever your tool is, don't be afraid to share it. You never know  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:21:45):**  who will be listening, who will be watching. Yeah, I guess it's learning or finding the  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:21:51):**  tribe around you that enables you to understand that this is all about being again. And if  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:21:57):**  you're just being, then in theory, everyone around you can grow from that. Because that's  
**[0:22:03-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:22:03):**  the authenticity again, isn't it? What we were talking about earlier, being authentic,  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:22:08):**  finding the authentic Richie within the story, right? Yeah. So I'm Tony now, right? And I've,  
**[0:22:15-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:22:15):**  let's say I'm smashing out hours in the office. Get back, whack in a microwave meal, stay  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:22:26):**  up, watch a bit of news on my joe in Chandler chair. Have all the lights on around me eventually  
**[0:22:33-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:22:33):**  creeping to bed probably about just past midnight. Wake up to the beep beep beep in the morning,  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:22:40):**  hit snooze, beep beep, beep beep snooze, get up, go and smash some coffee because that's  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:22:45):**  the only thing that can ignite a bowel movement. And then probably skip breakfast because I've  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:22:50):**  run out of time. Get a shower, cover myself in chemicals aftershave, smash the door shut,  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:22:57):**  leg it as fast as I can to the tube because I'm in hypertension already and get involved  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:23:02):**  with the whole commute that's probably gone through the same process. Can't bear to look  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:23:06):**  at someone on the tube because I'm feeling ashamed of myself in reality and arrive at  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:23:11):**  the office to sit down. What would you advise me? I'm already anxious reliving that whole  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:23:17):**  experience. Yeah man. I've been there. Yeah we've all been, that's how I know it you know.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:23:22):**  I left London because I acted on my gut instinct that that was not a healthy place to remain  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:23:30):**  and it wasn't sustainable. So I wanted to practice what I preach and I wanted to like  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:23:35):**  make the move and it was a big move that happened over two weeks because I know how easy it  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:23:40):**  is to get caught up in that routine and the habit and not know how to get off that ride.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:23:46):**  Oh yeah I'm just gonna throw in here, we're not, anyway anyone's listening, we're not  
**[0:23:49-0:23:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:23:49):**  judging you for that behaviour just highlighting that that's what's been normalised and we  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:23:56):**  just want to give you some tools to help you just see maybe a different way. Yeah I'd be  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:24:02):**  a hypocrite if I said that I've got it all figured out and that I have a routine that  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:24:07):**  is nailed and it's always perfect. No no no no. Well when you do think you've got it figured  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:24:11):**  out then the process shows you and actually you're still in the process. Get back in your  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:24:16):**  box. So because I've been there I can authentically say I know where you are at if you are living  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:24:22):**  that life and it can feel a bit, you can feel lost, you can feel a bit helpless, you feel  
**[0:24:27-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:24:27):**  stuck, demotivated, like upset, frustrated, angry all these things or maybe just completely  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:24:35):**  unaware that you're in that space and maybe just need a little reminder to just check  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:24:40):**  yourself and take a little step back and just reassess if that is your life, are you happy  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:24:47):**  and what are the little changes you can make to maybe get on a new ride to start to make  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:24:53):**  changes that are more positive, that are maybe one step closer to where you really want to  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:24:58):**  be because you know that's not sustainable and it's affecting your health physically,  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:25:02):**  mentally, emotionally, spiritually however you want to look at it. But also it's affecting  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:25:07):**  the health of others because that's what you're also the addition to the normalised behaviour  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:25:12):**  right? Definitely, your family whether it's your wife, your partner, your kids, your friends,  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:25:17):**  your work colleagues, if you're not living a life of fulfilment and purpose and you're  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:25:23):**  waking up happy and you have time and you feel healthy and you're eating well and you're  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:25:27):**  getting time to do the things that you love it's like you're resenting something and you're  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:25:32):**  wishing something was different and that affects your mood, your personality, your energy.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:25:37):**  Your energy then affects that person that you're around the most and the people that  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:25:41):**  your environment so you're in the office and the rest of the people around you like it  
**[0:25:45-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:25:45):**  just passes through everybody that you're around. So having rituals that I've embraced  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:25:53):**  living the life that I live now is really the key for me to keep on that journey and  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:25:58):**  to be able to then share the ups and downs that that brings when you step out of that  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:26:03):**  those habits that do keep you on track. So the takeaway here I guess to maybe inspire  
**[0:26:09-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:26:09):**  people to start those changes is okay well just maybe audit your life a little bit and  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:26:16):**  see where you can make little changes that are sustainable, that are realistic that will  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:26:21):**  have an impact straight away. So I do these morning routines you just described a morning  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:26:25):**  routine that is definitely not going to set you off in the right frequency. So one thing  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:26:31):**  before you wake up is sleep. You know Matthew Walker created a huge wave of interest after  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:26:36):**  all the science that he brought to the table which I endorsed massively because it transformed  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:26:42):**  who I am by prioritizing getting a good night's sleep before you go to bed. How much technology  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:26:48):**  you've got your phone and your iPad in front of your face taking in all this stimulation  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:26:53):**  before you get in bed and then expect to have a good sleep it's not going to happen. Beyond  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:26:58):**  the device even the news at 10. Yeah you know crazy. Yeah the crazy stuff that's going on  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:27:03):**  in the world would that be discussed around a campfire. Feed your brain with all that  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:27:07):**  fear and destruction and pain and suffering and worry and then let it completely immerse  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:27:12):**  your subconscious so then you go into your dream state with all this other clutter. So  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:27:18):**  sleep is definitely something to audit and there's so much great information out there  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:27:22):**  to how to improve that you know when you eat switching off you know a little bedtime ritual

**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:32:46):**  quite overwhelming intimidating to try and tackle all these things that you think aren't

**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:33:20):**  I think if we can leave a really positive message from these chats it's like okay well

**[0:33:57-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:33:57):**  the basics consistently becoming basic back to basics I think I'm all human I need that

**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:34:12):**  I take on too much well I think the I think the more work you do the more you understand  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:34:18):**  or can align with there is no perfect that's the point no that's all control isn't it once  
**[0:34:24-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:34:24):**  you let that go then you realize ah okay I just need to strive for the be the best example  
**[0:34:30-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:34:30):**  of self rather than what I perceive perfection to be yeah and that's sometimes can be the  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:34:39):**  negative side of what we're talking about social media right yeah you can look at that  
**[0:34:43-0:34:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:34:43):**  and that's not sustainable no so someone gave me a great tool and it was to delete the accounts  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:34:50):**  that were creating anxiety yeah that's it you don't have to be on Instagram no just  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:34:55):**  look at the things that you feel are empowering you and that you can gain simple tools again  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:35:00):**  to make small changes that might be sleep this week okay let me let me go and geek out

**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:35:19):**  phase and I don't want to dwell on this too much because we can go deep into the social  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:35:23):**  stuff well yeah we could talk for hours I know we could but this is something I can  
**[0:35:29-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:35:29):**  relate to because I've had this feeling of like oh what if someone gets upset because  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:35:33):**  I've stopped following them because I've just decided to unfollow them because at that moment  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:35:39):**  in time I decided that I wasn't in a place where I wanted to see that I didn't want to  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:35:44):**  hear that I didn't want to watch that because at that point in my life it wasn't making  
**[0:35:49-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:35:49):**  me feel good about myself so I decided I'm going to put my attention onto something else  
**[0:35:55-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:35:55):**  that does nurture a good feeling brings happiness to makes me smile yeah maybe I'll follow a  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:36:02):**  few animal accounts about zoo animals being cared for and rescue dogs and stuff like that  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:36:07):**  I love that it makes me feel good yeah nothing to do with my business but I love animals  
**[0:36:11-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:36:11):**  and they make me feel good I love animals being rescued and I love animals being cared  
**[0:36:15-0:36:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:36:15):**  for I just followed loads of pet channels for a while and it brought me back into a  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:36:19):**  nice place of well there are good humans out there doing nice things and myself you know  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:36:25):**  I will also then do a little detox on certain things because I realize I'm not in that space  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:36:31):**  anymore that was just a distraction that channel that person I was following was where I used  
**[0:36:36-0:36:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:36:36):**  to be I'm not there anymore I've evolved from that yeah thank you for what you did give  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:36:42):**  me but now I'm not in that place I'm now going on this path and that makes me feel even better  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:36:47):**  because I've evolved I've grown and I think you know we all have that ability to choose  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:36:52):**  don't we we don't have to suffer we just choose to suffer sometimes you know and chronically  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:36:57):**  go into that point of I want to suffer and I can't stop watching them for whatever reason  
**[0:37:02-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:37:02):**  whereas that's your choice yeah don't become a victim within that system but also I think  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:37:08):**  the big one for me has always been it's it's none of my business what other people think  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:37:13):**  of me yeah so you know if I want to remove an account then I remove an account otherwise  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:37:18):**  I'm on it to please them and I'm prioritizing them over me we care a lot about what other  
**[0:37:23-0:37:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:37:23):**  people think exactly and you're the most important person you are the most important person and  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:37:30):**  if you start to follow accounts and search into social media looking for distraction  
**[0:37:35-0:37:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:37:35):**  okay we'll just be a bit more conscious and aware of what those distractions are doing  
**[0:37:41-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:37:41):**  to you and now are you living in someone else's bubble that is probably an illusion and how  
**[0:37:49-0:37:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:37:49):**  is that making you feel and in that moment you have a choice to carry on or to divert  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:37:52):**  your attention to something that really speaks to you that will lift your vibe that will  
**[0:37:57-0:38:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:37:57):**  bring value into your life and there's so many great people doing that now and it's  
**[0:38:01-0:38:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:38:01):**  awesome to see it's not just about you know getting you know flaunting yourself and promoting  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:38:07):**  your next thing there's a lot of great people speaking truth and inspiring and going down  
**[0:38:13-0:38:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:38:13):**  to the root of you know where we can make change and I'm really proud to know that I'm  
**[0:38:18-0:38:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:38:18):**  making that shift and really be more thoughtful of where I'm taking my attention and I see  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:38:26):**  a lot of that happen now so I'm excited about where the industry is going and how people  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:38:30):**  are taking that responsibility to heart and seeing how serious it actually is to influence  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:38:35):**  someone is a real powerful tool and you've got to think about what you're influencing  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:38:40):**  them with oh exactly that's that's a real powerful gift yeah yeah and if you think of  
**[0:38:46-0:38:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:38:46):**  it that way you know if we're looking to the external world outside then we need to probably  
**[0:38:52-0:38:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:38:52):**  think oh what's going on inside that I keep needing to reach out for and so as an influencer  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:38:59):**  it's important then to realize that people are looking to the external world and that  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:39:04):**  the messages we need to give are going to be about getting them to understand what's  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:39:08):**  going on inside and we have to check ourselves don't we we sometimes go off lose our way  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:39:13):**  a little bit because we got stimulated by something and we thought well maybe we should  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:39:17):**  put some attention or triggered by something triggered and then we respond we react yeah  
**[0:39:23-0:39:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:39:23):**  and then you look back and go I don't remember that I don't know why I put that out there  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:39:26):**  I don't know why I like express that emotion for that but it triggered you for whatever  
**[0:39:31-0:39:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:39:31):**  reason yeah I think we were talking about this earlier and I think it's a very interesting  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:39:35):**  space that it feels like this is an ego by the way this just feels like the more work  
**[0:39:41-0:39:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:39:41):**  you do when you do go or something does trigger you or adversity I was talking about adversity  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:39:48):**  earlier right suddenly it's like wow okay my world's ending right now I've set up this  
**[0:39:53-0:39:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:39:53):**  30-day challenge and right now I can't run anymore the world's going to end and sobbing  
**[0:39:58-0:40:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:39:58):**  in my hands and roaring into the traffic because I can't run anymore right and then it was  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:40:02):**  like wow okay that that's triggering and then it's recognizing I'm triggered I'm now the  
**[0:40:07-0:40:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:40:07):**  victim this is happening to me right is it or is it happening for me okay let's sit away  
**[0:40:13-0:40:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:40:13):**  from it and I think the more work you do the less time you spend in the trauma of it all  
**[0:40:21-0:40:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:40:21):**  you know the more you can highlight what it is and what's coming up for you yeah and that's  
**[0:40:28-0:40:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:40:28):**  a huge part of self-awareness yeah and being responsible for your actions and your behavior  
**[0:40:36-0:40:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:40:36):**  and owning it don't blame anybody else your choice yeah you choose it's on you you know  
**[0:40:43-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:40:43):**  just stop for a second observe what's going on embrace it acknowledge it you know just  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:40:50):**  accept that's what's going on in that moment and understand why and strip it back a little  
**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:40:55):**  bit to get back to the the trigger and knowing again it's all down to you maybe it's a past  
**[0:40:59-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:40:59):**  trauma maybe it's something that you'd you know you brought on yourself and I think the  
**[0:41:06-0:41:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:41:06):**  more aware we can be and just accepting and being that vulnerable person that has actually  
**[0:41:12-0:41:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:41:12):**  becomes quite empowered from that vulnerability hopefully that inspires more people to lean  
**[0:41:17-0:41:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:41:17):**  in and kind of like sit with what's coming up to maybe work back from that and understand  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:41:23):**  it and use that as a strength yeah for me I think I think breath's one of the most breath  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:41:28):**  is one of the most potent tools for that you know oh I'm I can feel I'm elevated I can  
**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:41:33):**  feel there's a bit of anxiety there I'm gonna do some breath any breathing tools what do  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:41:39):**  you recommend so many breathing tools what's the simplest form to help someone down regulate  
**[0:41:44-0:41:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:41:44):**  what would you do so to simplify down regulation based on my own personal experience is what  
**[0:41:50-0:41:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:41:50):**  I see resonates with a lot of other people when I teach real foundation classes and workshops  
**[0:41:57-0:42:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:41:57):**  is one being aware of what's happening with your breathing being aware of what's happening  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:42:03):**  in the process of a breath a lot of people say I can't meditate I can't breathe I get  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:42:08):**  so distracted got a really busy mind I'm really overstimulated I'm super stressed whatever  
**[0:42:12-0:42:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:42:12):**  the stimulus is whatever the emotion is is okay well one thing don't beat yourself up  
**[0:42:18-0:42:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:42:18):**  if you feel you can't do it just observe the next breath and then observe the next breath  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:42:26):**  but if your mind is still busy don't worry except that's the way you feel in that moment  
**[0:42:32-0:42:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:42:32):**  observe the next breath nasal breathing compared to mouth breathing there's a purpose for both  
**[0:42:38-0:42:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:42:38):**  yeah but day to day if we're looking to down regulate and to bring calm and to get into  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:42:45):**  more restful digestion state and you know calm and repair repair repairing restorative  
**[0:42:50-0:42:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:42:50):**  whatever you want to call it down regulation is to start to slow down the breath to take  
**[0:42:58-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:42:58):**  control of the breath and then be aware then of what happens physically emotionally mentally  
**[0:43:05-0:43:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:43:05):**  when you start to lengthen those breaths go a little bit deeper and then inhale for the  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:43:12):**  nose and then exhale for the nose if you struggle with nasal breathing people still do yeah  
**[0:43:17-0:43:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:43:17):**  and I'm very aware of that work towards inhaling for the nose so it slows it down and then  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:43:24):**  lengthen the breath out when you release it slow it down even more and then observe the  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:43:29):**  next breath and then starting to count the breath I think is the key part because then  
**[0:43:33-0:43:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:43:33):**  it's less brain chatter when you're having to internally count so inhale for four seconds  
**[0:43:40-0:43:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:43:40):**  have a really conscious mindful pause before you breathe out and then count how long it  
**[0:43:45-0:43:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:43:45):**  takes you to breathe that exhalation and then repeat it yeah maybe it's a little bit longer  
**[0:43:51-0:43:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:43:51):**  the next time maybe it's a little bit shorter but take your next breath so I always get  
**[0:43:57-0:44:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:43:57):**  people to play with it because if I set the intention of right I want you to all breathe  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:44:01):**  in for four seconds and then exhale for eight seconds because that's what I find works for  
**[0:44:06-0:44:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:44:06):**  my you know balance okay well that person might and feel anxious because they can't  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:44:14):**  hit the four eight they can't hit the four eight so you do you one day it might be different  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:44:19):**  maybe you're super stimulated one day and you and that four becomes two and the eight  
**[0:44:24-0:44:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:44:24):**  becomes three and like and I can't breathe into my nose today okay well what can you  
**[0:44:29-0:44:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:44:29):**  do can you do a out for your mouth okay when then can your next breath be in for the nose  
**[0:44:35-0:44:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:44:35):**  and out for the nose so that's a long way to explain that but I want them to have permission  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:44:41):**  to know that each day might be a little bit different yeah but just observe and accept  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:44:46):**  that's the way you feel in that moment and then work on it which ties in with being present  
**[0:44:51-0:44:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:44:51):**  be present because the awareness of your breath the awareness of the process is a mindful  
**[0:44:57-0:45:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:44:57):**  act which allows you to be less stimulated by your environment or whatever's triggered  
**[0:45:02-0:45:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:45:02):**  you whatever's wound you up it might just be one breath that gets you to go yeah the  
**[0:45:13-0:45:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:45:13):**  breath is what I need to get you back to the present to bring you back to assess to recalibrate  
**[0:45:20-0:45:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:45:20):**  to check in to then go about whatever it is you've got to tackle next even if that's a  
**[0:45:26-0:45:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:45:26):**  good night's sleep because you've got 10 rounds of solid consistent breath and you build on  
**[0:45:31-0:45:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:45:31):**  it the next day you build on it the next day and if you forget one day it's okay we all  
**[0:45:37-0:45:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:45:37):**  do it you know you can always come back to that it starts with breath it ends with breath  
**[0:45:41-0:45:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:45:41):**  yeah and I want to add to that because I have this whole thing about a PB I'm writing about  
**[0:45:45-0:45:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:45:45):**  at the moment because I had this with the ice bar I thought I'm gonna I've got to get  
**[0:45:48-0:45:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:45:48):**  in the ice and I've got to get my PB and it's for me it's now just a present best or a profound  
**[0:45:53-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:45:53):**  best so every day every minute is going to be different every hour is going to be different  
**[0:45:58-0:46:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:45:58):**  that's the point you know it's whatever that present best can be in that moment nice man  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-5-Richie-Norton-e5gq2p#t=0:46:06):**  that was our present best it was I like that I'm hyped I always love chatting about this

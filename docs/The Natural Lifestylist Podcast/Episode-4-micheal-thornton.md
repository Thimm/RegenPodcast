### The Natural Lifestylist Podcast  (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 18:56:52)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:00):**  Hi, I'm Tony Riddle and this is the Natural Lifestylist podcast.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:06):**  So way back in December I had this crazy idea to run from Land's End to John O'Groats in  
**[0:00:11-0:00:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:11):**  just 30 days.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:12):**  But I wasn't just going to run it, I was going to run it barefoot to raise funds for environmental  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:17):**  charities and collaborate with world leading experts to raise awareness and money for six  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:23):**  organisations fighting the top sustainability issues of our time.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:28):**  I knew running barefoot would raise many a socially extreme eyebrow and with that eyebrow  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:32):**  raising behaviour I would be able to provide a perfect platform to highlight the importance  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:37):**  of connecting with our environment and those key sustainability issues of our time.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:43):**  I had the pleasure of getting behind the mic with the man with the sustainability plan,  
**[0:00:49-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:49):**  Michael Thornton.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:51):**  Michael Thornton is an engineer, entrepreneur and the founder of Carbon Analytics.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:56):**  After close to a decade working on sustainable water, power and projects around the world  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:01):**  as a civil engineer, Michael accepted a scholarship for an MBA in social entrepreneurship at Oxford  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:07):**  University with a question in mind.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:11):**  How do we transform our global economy to understand and value the natural world it  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:16):**  depends on?  
**[0:01:18-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:18):**  And how do we do it without relying on government?  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:21):**  Well Carbon Analytics, his company that automates carbon footprinting for businesses and supply  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:26):**  chains is the result of that question.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:29):**  Michael and I continued the conversation away from the mics as we go for a 10 mile run to  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:33):**  finish my 30 for the day.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:35):**  Now trust me when I say that this is the man with the sustainability plan.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:40):**  Ever since this conversation I've been spreading his Carbon Analytics message to my brothers  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:44):**  and sisters.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:45):**  So I really hope you enjoy the conversation.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:47):**  So I'm here with Michael, Michael Thornton.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:53):**  This is great because Michael has found me through the Rich Roll podcast.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:56):**  Listening to the Rich Roll podcast.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:59):**  Inspired by that, then found out about the run and then was here in the UK.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:03):**  So it's all kind of just come together.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:04):**  It's incredible.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:05):**  Power of social media.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:07):**  So Michael, CEO, CEO of Carbon Analytics.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:16):**  This is amazing system here and I think we can all benefit from listening to Michael.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:23):**  Me personally, it's something that I have to justify sometimes.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:28):**  Like the Rich Roll podcast for instance.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:30):**  It was like, okay, I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk about sustainability.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:34):**  Yeah, I'm going to fly to LA.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:36):**  You know, just simple things like that.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:38):**  Or, oh, we got to get a train or we got to get a car.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:42):**  You know, certain things we can be doing.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:43):**  There's certain things we can think about at least offsetting these days.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:47):**  So let's get a bit of background on Michael.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:50):**  Who is Michael?  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:51):**  Oh yeah, good one.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:53):**  Well, I guess started off as an engineer really.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:56):**  So went to school.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:57):**  My whole family is an engineer.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:59):**  I think you mentioned your dad was an engineer.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:01):**  Yeah, yeah, there we go.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:03):**  So yeah, I came from a family of engineers.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:06):**  Always had two hats, the engineering hat.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:08):**  So I was a civil engineer undergrad and then also got an environmental policy degree.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:11):**  So kind of had those two worlds and then a few years ago added in a business hat and  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:17):**  went to business school at Oxford for a school scholarship, social entrepreneurship.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:22):**  And that's the carbon analytics is the collision of those.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:24):**  So quite familiar with the UK now.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:27):**  Now familiar with the UK, although I haven't been out to this region, which is...  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:30):**  That's my first too, man.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:31):**  This is definitely my first.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:32):**  Gorgeous out here.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:33):**  Yeah, yeah, beautiful.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:36):**  And then really the idea of carbon analytics is that there's one way of thinking about  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:43):**  sustainability which is that we should all go back to living in caves and that's how  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:47):**  you can avoid those flights and you can avoid any impact on the world.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:51):**  As William McDonough said, striving for zero is not very exciting.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:56):**  It's not a place that most people would be excited to go.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:59):**  So I think we have to look at what's the opposite of zero and that's 100% sustainable world.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:03):**  That's where we can travel and visit each other and have these great important interactions  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:09):**  and learn, but do it in a way that's not gonna threaten the entire planet.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:13):**  And to do that, we have to change the system.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:17):**  And how do we do that?  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:18):**  So our idea is that the core kind of problem we have is that our economy...  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:23):**  Economy, you can think of it as a machine.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:25):**  You can think of it as a calculation engine that figures out how do you allocate resources?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:30):**  If I wanna go buy a sandwich, what needs to happen in the rest of the economy to bring  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:35):**  that sandwich to me?  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:36):**  And someone will make some bread and someone will make some mayonnaise and whatever else,  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:41):**  and then someone will put it on a plate and bring it to you.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:44):**  And all of that has all these impacts and the economy is very good at calculating what  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:48):**  that should cost and it brings you a value and says, okay, yeah, four quid, there's your  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:53):**  sandwich.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:54):**  Oh, for our convenience.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:55):**  For your convenience.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:57):**  But the problem is that that calculation engine, although it's very efficient, it doesn't understand  
**[0:04:59-0:05:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:59):**  the world that it's living in.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:00):**  It has no knowledge of our environment, no knowledge of our social system beyond what  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:05):**  we push on it.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:07):**  So in economics, you call that externalities.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:09):**  These are things that happen when you buy your sandwich that you don't intend to happen,  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:13):**  but they're real consequences.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:15):**  Inconveniences of the convenience.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:17):**  Inconveniences of convenience.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:18):**  There you go.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:19):**  Yeah, not like that.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:20):**  And so because we don't have a system that can incorporate that, it's just gonna get  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:25):**  trampled.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:26):**  It's gonna get trampled that we have this brilliant engine for commerce and convenience,  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:32):**  but if it doesn't understand the world, it's gonna trample that world.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:35):**  And that's where we're at.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:36):**  And so our idea is that we need to build the next economy that understands the physical,  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:42):**  biological, societal limits that the world has that are the realities and can change  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:48):**  the calculations to incorporate those.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:51):**  So speaking less, kind of theoretically, it's like if you buy a sandwich, you're causing  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:57):**  carbon emissions.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:58):**  There should be a price in that sandwich for those carbon emissions.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:01):**  Yeah, so someone said to me the other day, we were talking about sustainable fashion.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:03):**  I used to have a clothing brand and he quit.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:08):**  Think it was along the lines of, a bit like Patagonia, right?  
**[0:06:13-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:13):**  Just being here has an impact.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:16):**  So it's like, I think they said something along the lines of, well, we're trying to  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:22):**  do this, this, and this, and this for our business to be sustainable.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:25):**  And they said, well, the best thing you can do for a business to be sustainable is to  
**[0:06:28-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:28):**  not have a business.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:29):**  Do you know what I mean?  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:30):**  Because it can't survive that way though, can it?  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:33):**  So yeah, I love this.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:35):**  And it's, you know, that's like, I run into a lot of environmentalists who are still,  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:40):**  or they have the mindset that people are bad, that we've got too many people on the planet.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:45):**  And that's bad.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:47):**  And like, what a system that we've set up where more people is bad somehow.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:52):**  Like there's something fundamentally wrong with that.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:54):**  Like should we all, you know, is the ultimate environmentalism for us all to go away?  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:58):**  No, that's crazy.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:59):**  Well, you know, I posted up, you know, on social media, because I put stuff about my  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:04):**  family up there and people like that.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:06):**  And you know, we were just like, oh, we're expecting another baby.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:09):**  And this woman jumped into my stories and was like, how dare you?  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:13):**  How selfish of you bringing another child into this world, there's already enough beings  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:18):**  on the planet.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:19):**  And I just thought, oh, my God, can you imagine if, you know, so someone could have said that  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:24):**  16 years ago, when Greta Thunberg was born, right?  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:28):**  Someone could have said that, because what we're looking at is the people within governments  
**[0:07:31-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:31):**  of today that have a certain maturity or level, then they're not really in the process of  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:38):**  understanding it, you know, and we almost need those younger generations to come through.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:43):**  Which would of course, increase the numbers on the planet.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:45):**  So yeah, we have to make it sustainable for the numbers that are there that are going  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:48):**  to shift the change of the future, right?  
**[0:07:50-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:50):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:51):**  Yeah, I think I think it also, you know, it's kind of like, do you believe people are good  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:57):**  for the universe?  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:58):**  And I think, I think I do.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:00):**  Well, the universe obviously thinks we are right.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:02):**  I think the universe does.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:03):**  And I think churning us out.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:04):**  Exactly.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:05):**  It brought us here.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:06):**  Yeah, hopefully, you know, we should, we should do what we can.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:09):**  And I think might be cribbing on Elon Musk, who's probably cribbing on someone else a  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:13):**  little bit, but to further the light of consciousness, you know, in the universe and do all we can  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:18):**  to keep this this going.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:20):**  And I think the way to do that is to have more people, people are great.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:23):**  The problem is the way we the world we have right now, the system we've set up to support  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:28):**  all those people doesn't understand the world doesn't understand the climate doesn't understand  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:34):**  the soil doesn't understand toxicity.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:36):**  So well, in simple terms, doesn't understand how to support a number of people has no idea  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:41):**  and no and it's a math, you know, if you think of it as a mathematical engine, that those  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:47):**  walls on the economy just don't exist.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:49):**  They're not there.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:50):**  Because when you, you know, when you cause an externality, that data is not even in your  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:54):**  transaction.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:55):**  So when you're trying to optimize how much should this cost, there's no, well, all we  
**[0:08:59-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:59):**  know is the template.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:01):**  There's no there's no limits.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:02):**  So our idea is carbon analytics is to find a way to put those that data in every transaction  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:09):**  so that when you make a financial transaction, you have some understanding of those limits  
**[0:09:14-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:14):**  of the world.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:15):**  And then if enough people, you know, I think there's enough people that care about those  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:20):**  limits that that starts to put a price on those transactions is the core idea.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:25):**  So in other words, you know, if you can, in every when you buy a sandwich, if you can  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:30):**  see how much carbon is in that sandwich, there's enough people that will say, Hey, we should  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:34):**  have we should, you know, not kill our climate to get sandwiches that enough people will  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:38):**  put a price on that.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:39):**  Yeah, that sends a signal down to the suppliers and says, Hey, we should get lower carbon  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:44):**  plates and lower carbon mannays versus higher carbon.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:46):**  And that's how you create a system that can optimize around climate and all these limits  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:51):**  that we have.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:52):**  And that's, that's possible.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:53):**  That's what you're saying.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:54):**  That's Yeah, so what you're doing, that's pot.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:55):**  That's incredible, isn't it?  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:58-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:58):**  So it took a while.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:59):**  Yeah, it took us a couple of years of R&D in the UK.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:03):**  Started out of Oxford, lucky enough to get a number of grants from the EU and UK.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:08):**  To develop the economic system so that now we can we have an engine that plugs financial  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:14):**  data in.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:15):**  So hooks up to QuickBooks and zero looks at each transaction a business makes and puts  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:19):**  a carbon footprint on it.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:21):**  And then critically, we also look at not only the initial good, but the supply chain behind  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:26):**  it.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:27):**  So, so business don't have to be signed up for that.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:30):**  You can already analyze it.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:31):**  We or do they they have to be so if they want to look at their own business, they need to  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:35):**  sign up.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:36):**  Okay, good.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:37):**  So if we if they're not signed up, we're still going to put a footprint on you.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:41):**  So I was wondering just have you and we do the way we do that is we look at, have you  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:45):**  released any data about your carbon?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:47):**  Probably not.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:48):**  That's 99% of businesses.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:49):**  So if not, we look at what do we know about you as an industrial entity?  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:52):**  And where are you likely to spend your money?  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:55):**  So really, what we're doing is we're figuring out, I'm going to spend 100 pounds, where  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:58):**  does that 100 pounds go in the economy?  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:00):**  Who is now running to get you goods or services?  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:03):**  And what is that going to do to the environment?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:05):**  And we're calculating all that back for every transaction.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:08):**  So if we know nothing about you, we know you're a sandwich shop.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:10):**  And here's how sandwich shops typically are going to impact the economy to infinity.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:16):**  And that encourages the companies to then take responsibility, right?  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:19):**  That's the idea is we can if we get the buyers, the purchasers to start incorporating carbon  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:25):**  into their decision making, then you have a pressure and a reason for lower carbon companies  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:29):**  to be preferred over higher carbon.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:31):**  And so then you can use the economic capitalist system, which is very efficient, but you can  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:38):**  now optimize on not just price, but price plus carbon.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:41):**  Apply that filter to that.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:42):**  Exactly.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:44):**  And that's the core idea.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:45):**  And then the, so that's the kind of the theory of change.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:48):**  And then the next hard problem is how do we turn that into a business?  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:52):**  And what we realized is that carbon footprinting is kind of stuck in the stone ages.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:55):**  It's very manual right now for companies.  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:57):**  Typically, a consultant will come in.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:58):**  They'll measure usually whatever is easy to measure or whatever, utility bill, very precise.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:04):**  You've got how much power a company has used.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:07):**  You can put a footprint on that quite easily.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:10):**  What's hard to put a footprint on is your IT services or your insurance company, the  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:17):**  full supply chain that actually supports what you do.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:19):**  So that's usually ignored is the way that they do it.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:23):**  So we've realized that we can upgrade that whole industry really with our system and  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:27):**  automate it using the financial data.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:30):**  So because it's data you've already got, we can process it with our technology, automate  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:34):**  it and make it a lot faster, a lot cheaper for companies.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:37):**  So now we're starting to work with a lot of B Corps, a lot of small and midsize fashion  
**[0:12:41-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:41):**  food type companies.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:43):**  So this is like macro or right down to micro at this stage, right?  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:50):**  So it's really, what's your footprint as a business across the world?  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:51):**  You know, we, like, for example, we just worked with a company, Rebel Kitchen.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:55):**  That's where I was going to go next.  
**[0:12:57-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:57):**  Who's with you?  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:58):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:59):**  Who's on board?  
**[0:13:00-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:00):**  So they're a great one.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:01):**  They're like an alternative milk company here in the UK.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:03):**  They're doing quite well.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:06):**  And they wanted to get their carbon footprint.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:08):**  So we worked with them, used our system, and they not only got their company's footprint,  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:11):**  but their full global impact of their supply chain.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:15):**  Oh, wow.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:16):**  So the whole thing's traceable right back.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:19):**  All to quote unquote to infinity, which is like basically until those, until that a hundred  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:23):**  pounds disappears in terms of impact on the economy, they got their footprint and then  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:27):**  they offset the entire thing.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:29):**  So if you now go buy some alternative milk from Rebel Kitchen, it's truly offset.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:34):**  And you can, you know, basically the carbon is now priced into that system.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:38):**  It's in the future world.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:40):**  So what's in the, how do we offset it?  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:43):**  What is, what's involved with offsetting?  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:45):**  So offsetting is a whole, you know, we're not offsetters.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:48):**  There's a whole other industry there.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:49):**  And effectively what offsetters do is they have projects around the world that cause  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:54):**  carbon to be up, you know, stored in some way.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:56):**  So usually it's a reforestation project.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:59):**  Could be something like cook stoves where you're basically reducing the amount of fossil  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:03):**  fuels that are burned for cooking.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:06):**  And those are good projects in and of themselves.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:09):**  But the almost the more important thing from our perspective is that they, they mean that  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:13):**  a company has put a price on carbon.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:15):**  They've put a price on this externality and they've decided to operate in this world where  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:19):**  the climate matters and the offset is there, you know, here's the money to prove that that's  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:25):**  what they're doing.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:26):**  And then that, that creates a forcing function within that company so that when they're making  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:31):**  a purchasing decision, they should be buying from the lower carbon supplier because that  
**[0:14:34-0:14:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:34):**  means their offset is lower.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:36):**  So they've, they're now taking that, that you know, initiative of, of around what they  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:42):**  want to do for the climate and they're pushing it into the supply chain because they're the  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:45):**  buyers.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:46):**  That's the biggest power every company has is they're going to spend millions of pounds.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:49):**  Around the world, they're now going to get to say we want lower carbon options for what  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:54):**  we're buying.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:55):**  Wow.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:56):**  Um, which, you know, that's how I think we can take the 2% of companies that really unfortunately  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:02):**  care about this and push that and make it an economy wide thing.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:06):**  More in the bubble.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:07):**  Oh, sorry.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:08):**  More inside the bubble.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:09):**  Blow the bubble up.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:11):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:12):**  Lovely.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:13):**  Blow the bubble up.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:14):**  Get, get, get more people involved.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:16):**  So anyways, yeah.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:17):**  Maybe, maybe the long way of saying all that, but just a bit of music coming in the background  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:21):**  there.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:22):**  Have you got that?  
**[0:15:23-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:23):**  No.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:24):**  Okay.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:26):**  It's a little party in the park.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:27):**  I thought we might be picking up on that then.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:29):**  So within the 2% you've got involved, so who else you got involved here in the UK?  
**[0:15:33-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:33):**  How many of you got?  
**[0:15:34-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:34):**  Yeah, so we, so we're still, we're still pretty young.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:37):**  So we, we launched the version one of our platform around two years ago.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:41):**  We had around a thousand companies sign up.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:43):**  Um, in some ways the mistake we made was that was free.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:45):**  So we got people kinda, you know, coming in, testing it out, but not really committed.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:50):**  So we've just launched the second version of our platform, which is paid and we've got

**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:25):**  Um, and uh, lots more fun ones on the way.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:26):**  I'm sure man.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:27):**  So what was the spark?  
**[0:16:28-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:28):**  What was, what was it?  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:29):**  What was it that triggered it for you?  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:31):**  This original, the idea, the concept, this is what I need to do now.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:35):**  So I, you know, behind this run, it's been right.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:38):**  Okay.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:39):**  For me, it's been, the parenthood really has been a big driver for me.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:43):**  That's really interesting.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:44):**  I'm glad you say that.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:46):**  Our CTO joined us with exactly that.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:47):**  He said, you know, I'm, I'm, I've worked on games and flight simulators and all that all  
**[0:16:52-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:52):**  my life.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:53):**  And I just had kids and we got, we got to do something about this.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:57):**  Because you just look at it and you think, you know, imagine what they're going to be  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:00):**  thinking in, I think Hugo mentioned something in one of the pods we did from Surfers Against  
**[0:17:05-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:05):**  Sewerage.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:06):**  And he was saying about, um, whale oil or something that we would have been using, you  
**[0:17:11-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:11):**  know, and then we, we move on so many years.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:13):**  And, and we think, Oh, what were we thinking?  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:15):**  What are we doing?  
**[0:17:16-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:16):**  All these generations that have no concept of that.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:19):**  You know, and for my kids is saying, you know, 10 years time to look back and say, wow, what  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:25):**  a mess you all made.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:26):**  You know, it's going to be that we have to, I mean, we have to be doing something, right?  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:30):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:31):**  And that's going back to that Greta Thunberg conversation.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:33):**  It's just, yeah.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:34):**  You know, you guys aren't listening.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:37):**  And like sometimes it takes people from the outside to come in and say, have you ever  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:40):**  actually looked at this whole system?  
**[0:17:43-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:43):**  Certainly.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:45):**  This is insane guys.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:47):**  Like I think, I think about automobiles that way.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:48):**  Like imagine if you tried today, if, if cars and roads didn't exist to try to propose automobiles  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:53):**  as a system for transport, like I just imagine those conversations like, okay, so what we're  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:58):**  going to do is we're going to have people get in these two ton metal boxes and drive  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:03):**  at a hundred miles an hour, a hundred kilometers an hour down the road.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:07):**  And that's how they're going to get from point A to B. And you'd be like, well, what's going  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:09):**  to prevent them from, you know, hitting pedestrians and other people.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:12):**  Well, we're going to paint a line on the road.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:15):**  That's going to be great.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:16):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:17):**  And it's going to burn flammable gas.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:19):**  It's going to have a huge impact.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:20):**  It's insane.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:22):**  You tried to propose it, but, but you know, here, here we are.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:24):**  And sometimes it takes someone from the outside to come in and say, well, that's dumb guys.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:28):**  What are you doing?  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:30):**  And then it, then it just takes, then it takes a little bit of time for people to hear that  
**[0:18:34-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:34):**  you're done.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:35):**  What are you doing?  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:36):**  You know?  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:38):**  Cause that's that.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:40):**  Just going by my runs, what I've been doing is yes.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:42):**  It's a flawed model, man.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:43):**  You know?  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:44):**  So going back to the spark.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:48):**  Um, yeah.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:49):**  I mean, I mean, you know, so I spent a long time as an engineer working around the world,  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:51):**  did a lot of sustainable infrastructure projects, water, power systems, which is really great.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:56):**  One thing I realized is that we, we had a really hard time pushing the clients, the  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:01):**  cities and companies that were working with towards green solutions.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:04):**  And I was as a young engineer, almost, you know, jumping into Excel and trying to create  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:09):**  a model for why this was going to be better for the climate and better for their finances  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:13):**  longterm.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:14):**  And I was like, this is, you know, really, we should be further along in this system.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:16):**  So I kind of had that in the back of my head.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:19):**  Always wanted to start a company.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:20):**  And then when, when I went to Oxford, just, you know, brought this question of how do  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:25):**  we, how do we shift this system in a meaningful way?  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:27):**  And what can I do as an, you know, an aspiring entrepreneur to do something about that?  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:31):**  And, you know, I think there's a couple of really big challenges in the world and there,  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:36):**  you know, there's sustainable transport, sustainable power, sustainable food.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:39):**  There's a lot of people working on those.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:41):**  The one I saw that really not enough people were thinking about is how do we, how do we  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:46):**  shift our, how do we shift the incentives in the economy?  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:50):**  And without relying on government to do that.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:53):**  And so that was the nexus is really hard challenge.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:57):**  We did a kind of a brainstorm a few days at the business school with some, some other  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:04):**  brilliant people came out with this idea and I said, and we, you know, we were like, actually,  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:08):**  maybe there's some, some legs on this.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:10):**  Let's, let's try to hash it out further.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:11):**  And it's, you know, been almost six years, but we've, we've now got a business model  
**[0:20:16-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:16):**  and a technology that we think can work.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:19):**  And is there any conversation in there?  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:21):**  Like, well, I was discussing with Hugo the other day, you know, how they, they, they  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:24):**  were one of the big voices in getting the charge on plastic bags, let's say, and changing  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:30):**  legislation.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:31):**  So is there that conversation that's happening between say, carbon analytics and the government?  
**[0:20:38-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:38):**  Is there that kind of...  
**[0:20:39-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:39):**  Not too much yet.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:41):**  So we're...  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:42):**  Do you feel as it grows that it's going to have a louder voice and it's...  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:45):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:46):**  There'll be more ears available.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:48):**  So the conversation we're having right now is more at the, more at the carbon footprint  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:54):**  and offset space.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:55):**  And it's around what should we be measuring for companies?  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:58):**  And we're really pushing the idea that you shouldn't just measure what is possible to  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:01):**  measure, you know, or based on whatever receipt, you know, easy to measure things, you should  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:07):**  always be measuring a hundred percent.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:09):**  What's the full impact of a business?  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:12):**  Because right now we have, you know, some ideas around you're carbon neutral if you've  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:16):**  offset just your offset office downtown, but you're going to ignore your factory over in  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:20):**  China.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:21):**  And that's like, no, you have...  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:23):**  And the transport from that to that.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:24):**  Yeah, and the transport and the farms.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:26):**  It's like, no, you haven't really done that.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:28):**  So, so...  
**[0:21:29-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:29):**  Full traceability.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:30):**  Exactly.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:32):**  So we're pushing right now is that, okay, if we're going to be doing that, let's measure  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:34):**  a hundred percent.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:35):**  Let's get to something that's comparable company to company to company.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:38):**  And if, you know, I think if we can do that, that's going to create a lot bigger market  
**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:41):**  and pressure.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:42):**  And then we, yeah, I would love to speak at the government level.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:47):**  And we've had, I guess, some really early conversations here and over in the US.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:51):**  But, you know, I think we've got some growing to do before we'll...  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:54):**  Well, I think they have some growing to do.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:56):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:21:57-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:57):**  That's true too.  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:00):**  I mean, it's a nascent space.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:01):**  Where's the mic drop?  
**[0:22:02-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:02):**  Tell me where the mic's from.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:03):**  I do it.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:04):**  I was wondering if that was you.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:05):**  Very good.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:06):**  No, no, no, no, it's just random.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:07):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:08):**  Yeah, it'd be nice for them to open their ears, wouldn't it?  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:15):**  I feel on multiple levels there.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:18):**  But again, I guess it's more voices come in, the more they have to listen, it's becoming  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:22):**  that level, isn't it?  
**[0:22:24-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:25):**  So what about...  
**[0:22:26-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:26):**  Because when we talk about sustainability, let's say sustainable fashion, and people  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:28):**  that I've spoken to that have tried to make shifts within their companies.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:32):**  And it's the financial implications of that for them usually, you know.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:37):**  And then the other end of that scale is from the consumer's perspective, that, oh my God,  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:42):**  I've had to pay whatever for a t-shirt, whereas a t-shirt from Fals Fashion is this much,  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:47):**  and I'm paying double for this.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:49):**  So what about the financial implications for the company and then for the consumer within  
**[0:22:55-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:55):**  the company?  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:56):**  How does that look?  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:57):**  Yeah, I mean, it's a real thing and some things should be more expensive.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:01):**  I'm totally with that.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:02):**  I really am.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:03):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:04):**  But yeah, I think that, you know, I guess I take a slightly different view on some of  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:10):**  this than a lot of people in the space in that I think if you've priced it properly  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:14):**  and everything is included in the price, you know, the negative environmental externalities,  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:19):**  there's nothing inherently wrong with say, Fals Fashion versus long-term fashion, you  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:24):**  know, versus this versus that.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:25):**  It's just as long as it's priced properly, that should be okay.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:29):**  So I think what, you know, yeah, maybe a roundabout way of getting at it, but I think what you  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:38):**  need to do is if you can get the environmental externalities priced in, what you'll end up  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:42):**  finding is some things probably can be more efficient than they are.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:47):**  And that just because something has a low cost doesn't mean it's necessarily bad and  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:51):**  you can, by saving environmental impact, you can save money in fact, in a lot of ways.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:57):**  Yeah, I don't know if I'm quite, quite,  
**[0:23:59-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:59):**  No, no, no, no, no, you're making sense there.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:02):**  Okay.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:05):**  So, you know, like flying is a really interesting example where, you know, you might, you might  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:10):**  to do the environmentally preferable thing, you might take a drive from one place to another,  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:15):**  but actually if you, if you work it out, the, the fuel costs, you're going to spend more  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:19):**  fuel than you would on the flight.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:21):**  And actually it turns out that that increased spending is an indication that you've actually  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:24):**  probably emitted more carbon than a flight would have taken.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:27):**  By driving.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:28):**  By driving.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:30):**  And that's certain routes in certain situations.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:31):**  And especially if you're alone in a car and all that, but the, you know, really the economic  
**[0:24:36-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:36):**  system is a very good calculation engine.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:38):**  It's a very good optimization engine.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:40):**  And if we can put carbon and environmental impact right alongside price, it should be  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:45):**  able to optimize really well.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:48):**  And probably we would find there's more abundance than we think in the world, not less.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:53):**  So it doesn't need, doesn't mean if we include environmental impact that we're going to need  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:58):**  to all stop buying and enjoying the world.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:00):**  I think, I think probably quite the opposite.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:02):**  We'll enjoy it more.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:03):**  I mean, can you see it, can you see it as the, it would lead to the individual having  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:08):**  a handle on this as well.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:09):**  I could say, right, okay, I'm going to fly, then I have to drive, then I can do this and  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:13):**  I can look at what would be the carbon footprint of all of that.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:17):**  And I could calculate it over time.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:18):**  Do you think that's possible?  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:19):**  Do you think that's moving, shifting that?  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:21):**  Yeah, I think it's definitely possible.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:22):**  I mean, we looked at it.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:24):**  And there's a couple of companies that do it in the space and they've done it even with  
**[0:25:28-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:28):**  credit cards, which is really interesting.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:30):**  I think the challenge has been the business model around it.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:32):**  Our consumer, is there enough spending willingness there amongst consumers to be able to build  
**[0:25:39-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:39):**  the system and then build the offsets around it?  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:42):**  And so far that's, yeah, hasn't panned out yet, but certainly could.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:47):**  If we had enough interested people, that's something we could do with our technology.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:50):**  It's such an interesting space, isn't it?  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:51):**  Because it all feels like it's so bizarre because it feels like it's all at this acorn  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:55):**  level.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:56):**  What do you mean acorn level?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:58):**  The acorn is waiting for this amazing oak tree to grow from it.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:02):**  You know, it does feel that the whole space feels like that.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:04):**  I think that suddenly people are listening and it's like there's been enough people speaking  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:08):**  in the space, but suddenly it's opening up.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:12):**  I think that's right.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:13):**  And it's, yeah, I mean, it's also challenging because, you know, as much as we want to do  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:19):**  as individuals, to some degree, we don't hold all the power directly.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:26):**  But the power that we do hold is the power to persuade these companies that this is something  
**[0:26:30-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:30):**  we care about.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:31):**  So we can't necessarily, we don't necessarily have enough products on the market where we  
**[0:26:34-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:34):**  can buy good flights or bad flights.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:36):**  But what we can do is say, hey, we want, we need to change this system.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:40):**  And that's what we really need to be demanding a change in the system and being angry, not  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:44):**  at, you know, Al Gore for taking a flight, but angry that flights emit carbon that damages  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:49):**  the planet in the first place.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:52):**  And it's, I don't know, it's an interesting time.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:55):**  And all of this is very new.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:56):**  You know, carbon measurement rules are very haphazard and exist, don't exist all over  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:01):**  the place.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:02):**  Carbon legislation is very new and barely exists all over the place.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:04):**  So we have all these people trying to do something, but we don't quite have the direct tools yet  
**[0:27:10-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:10):**  that are powerful enough.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:11):**  Okay.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:12):**  So how do businesses get involved?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:13):**  So, I mean, really easy.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:15):**  Go to CO2analytics.com.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:19):**  Very quick to link your finances, especially if you're on Xero, sign up, link your finances.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:24):**  We charge an annual fee for companies meant to be 90% less than a consultant would charge  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:29):**  and yeah, you know, and if you can't afford that and are just excited about what we're  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:34):**  doing, like, please do get in touch.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:36):**  We're always looking for champions and people who can help push us to their suppliers or  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:40):**  find other ways to push this.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:42):**  Or help connect in some way or another.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:46):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:47):**  Boom.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:48):**  Wonderful.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:50):**  And, you know, I really appreciate what you're doing on this run raising awareness.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:53):**  I mean, it's kind of like, it's one big long chain from people all the way down to our  
**[0:27:58-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:58):**  supply chain.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:59):**  We need people at every stage of the chain pushing and pulling and pulling and pulling  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:03):**  towards a better cleaner economy.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:06):**  And it's not just business, it's individuals, isn't it, within that, you know?  
**[0:28:11-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:11):**  So as an individual, how do I get involved?  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:12):**  So if I'm not a business and I'm an individual and I'm thinking, right, okay, is there a  
**[0:28:17-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:17):**  member?  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:18):**  Is there becoming a member or is there something that we can do to assist or?  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:20):**  Yeah, I mean, we don't have anything like that.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:24):**  Interesting idea.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:25):**  I think the biggest thing that we'd love you to do is, and maybe we could put together  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:29):**  an email to do this, but just ask your companies, ask your favorite companies, you know, what's  
**[0:28:33-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:33):**  their carbon footprint?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:34):**  What are they doing around climate?  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:36):**  What's their plan to live in a world, you know, create a world that's compatible with  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:42):**  1.5 degrees?  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:44):**  And if they don't have one, you know, come to us and we can help them do that.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:48):**  That's a good place to finish, man.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:50):**  That's good.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:51):**  That's brilliant.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:52):**  Thank you.

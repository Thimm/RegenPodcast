### Author(s): Tony Riddle  

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:00):**  Hi, I'm Tony Riddle and this is the Natural Lifestylist podcast.  So way back in December I had this crazy idea to run from Land's End to John O'Groats in  just 30 days.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:12):**  But I wasn't just going to run it, I was going to run it barefoot to raise funds for environmental  charities and collaborate with world leading experts to raise awareness and money for six  organisations fighting the top sustainability issues of our time.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:28):**  I knew running barefoot would raise many a socially extreme eyebrow and with that eyebrow  raising behaviour I would be able to provide a perfect platform to highlight the importance  of connecting with our environment and those key sustainability issues of our time.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:43):**  I had the pleasure of getting behind the mic with the man with the sustainability plan,  Michael Thornton.  Michael Thornton is an engineer, entrepreneur and the founder of Carbon Analytics.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:00:56):**  After close to a decade working on sustainable water, power and projects around the world  as a civil engineer, Michael accepted a scholarship for an MBA in social entrepreneurship at Oxford  University with a question in mind.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:11):**  How do we transform our global economy to understand and value the natural world it  depends on?  And how do we do it without relying on government?  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:21):**  Well Carbon Analytics, his company that automates carbon footprinting for businesses and supply  chains is the result of that question.  Michael and I continued the conversation away from the mics as we go for a 10 mile run to  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:33):**  finish my 30 for the day.  Now trust me when I say that this is the man with the sustainability plan.  Ever since this conversation I've been spreading his Carbon Analytics message to my brothers  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:44):**  and sisters.  So I really hope you enjoy the conversation.  So I'm here with Michael, Michael Thornton.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:01:53):**  This is great because Michael has found me through the Rich Roll podcast.  Listening to the Rich Roll podcast.  Inspired by that, then found out about the run and then was here in the UK.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:03):**  So it's all kind of just come together.  It's incredible.  Power of social media.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:07):**  So Michael, CEO, CEO of Carbon Analytics.  This is amazing system here and I think we can all benefit from listening to Michael.  Me personally, it's something that I have to justify sometimes.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:28):**  Like the Rich Roll podcast for instance.  It was like, okay, I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk about sustainability.  Yeah, I'm going to fly to LA.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:36):**  You know, just simple things like that.  Or, oh, we got to get a train or we got to get a car.  You know, certain things we can be doing.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:43):**  There's certain things we can think about at least offsetting these days.  So let's get a bit of background on Michael.  Who is Michael?  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:51):**  Oh yeah, good one.  Well, I guess started off as an engineer really.  So went to school.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:02:57):**  My whole family is an engineer.  I think you mentioned your dad was an engineer.  Yeah, yeah, there we go.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:03):**  So yeah, I came from a family of engineers.  Always had two hats, the engineering hat.  So I was a civil engineer undergrad and then also got an environmental policy degree.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:11):**  So kind of had those two worlds and then a few years ago added in a business hat and  went to business school at Oxford for a school scholarship, social entrepreneurship.  And that's the carbon analytics is the collision of those.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:24):**  So quite familiar with the UK now.  Now familiar with the UK, although I haven't been out to this region, which is...  That's my first too, man.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:31):**  This is definitely my first.  Gorgeous out here.  Yeah, yeah, beautiful.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:34):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then really the idea of carbon analytics is that there's one way of thinking about  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:43):**  sustainability which is that we should all go back to living in caves and that's how  you can avoid those flights and you can avoid any impact on the world.  As William McDonough said, striving for zero is not very exciting.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:03:56):**  It's not a place that most people would be excited to go.  So I think we have to look at what's the opposite of zero and that's 100% sustainable world.  That's where we can travel and visit each other and have these great important interactions  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:09):**  and learn, but do it in a way that's not gonna threaten the entire planet.  And to do that, we have to change the system.  And how do we do that?  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:18):**  So our idea is that the core kind of problem we have is that our economy...  Economy, you can think of it as a machine.  You can think of it as a calculation engine that figures out how do you allocate resources?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:30):**  If I wanna go buy a sandwich, what needs to happen in the rest of the economy to bring  that sandwich to me?  And someone will make some bread and someone will make some mayonnaise and whatever else,  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:41):**  and then someone will put it on a plate and bring it to you.  And all of that has all these impacts and the economy is very good at calculating what  that should cost and it brings you a value and says, okay, yeah, four quid, there's your  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:53):**  sandwich.  Oh, for our convenience.  For your convenience.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:04:56):**  Yeah.  But the problem is that that calculation engine, although it's very efficient, it doesn't understand  the world that it's living in.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:00):**  It has no knowledge of our environment, no knowledge of our social system beyond what  we push on it.  So in economics, you call that externalities.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:09):**  These are things that happen when you buy your sandwich that you don't intend to happen,  but they're real consequences.  Inconveniences of the convenience.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:17):**  Inconveniences of convenience.  There you go.  Yeah, not like that.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:20):**  And so because we don't have a system that can incorporate that, it's just gonna get  trampled.  It's gonna get trampled that we have this brilliant engine for commerce and convenience,  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:32):**  but if it doesn't understand the world, it's gonna trample that world.  And that's where we're at.  And so our idea is that we need to build the next economy that understands the physical,  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:42):**  biological, societal limits that the world has that are the realities and can change  the calculations to incorporate those.  So speaking less, kind of theoretically, it's like if you buy a sandwich, you're causing  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:05:57):**  carbon emissions.  There should be a price in that sandwich for those carbon emissions.  Yeah, so someone said to me the other day, we were talking about sustainable fashion.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:03):**  I used to have a clothing brand and he quit.  Think it was along the lines of, a bit like Patagonia, right?  Just being here has an impact.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:16):**  So it's like, I think they said something along the lines of, well, we're trying to  do this, this, and this, and this for our business to be sustainable.  And they said, well, the best thing you can do for a business to be sustainable is to  
**[0:06:28-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:28):**  not have a business.  Do you know what I mean?  Because it can't survive that way though, can it?  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:33):**  So yeah, I love this.  Yeah.  And it's, you know, that's like, I run into a lot of environmentalists who are still,  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:40):**  or they have the mindset that people are bad, that we've got too many people on the planet.  And that's bad.  And like, what a system that we've set up where more people is bad somehow.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:52):**  Like there's something fundamentally wrong with that.  Like should we all, you know, is the ultimate environmentalism for us all to go away?  No, that's crazy.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:06:59):**  Well, you know, I posted up, you know, on social media, because I put stuff about my  family up there and people like that.  And you know, we were just like, oh, we're expecting another baby.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:09):**  And this woman jumped into my stories and was like, how dare you?  How selfish of you bringing another child into this world, there's already enough beings  on the planet.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:19):**  And I just thought, oh, my God, can you imagine if, you know, so someone could have said that  16 years ago, when Greta Thunberg was born, right?  Someone could have said that, because what we're looking at is the people within governments  
**[0:07:31-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:31):**  of today that have a certain maturity or level, then they're not really in the process of  understanding it, you know, and we almost need those younger generations to come through.  Which would of course, increase the numbers on the planet.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:45):**  So yeah, we have to make it sustainable for the numbers that are there that are going  to shift the change of the future, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:07:51):**  Yeah, I think I think it also, you know, it's kind of like, do you believe people are good  for the universe?  And I think, I think I do.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:00):**  Well, the universe obviously thinks we are right.  I think the universe does.  And I think churning us out.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:04):**  Exactly.  It brought us here.  Yeah, hopefully, you know, we should, we should do what we can.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:09):**  And I think might be cribbing on Elon Musk, who's probably cribbing on someone else a  little bit, but to further the light of consciousness, you know, in the universe and do all we can  to keep this this going.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:20):**  And I think the way to do that is to have more people, people are great.  The problem is the way we the world we have right now, the system we've set up to support  all those people doesn't understand the world doesn't understand the climate doesn't understand  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:34):**  the soil doesn't understand toxicity.  So well, in simple terms, doesn't understand how to support a number of people has no idea  and no and it's a math, you know, if you think of it as a mathematical engine, that those  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:47):**  walls on the economy just don't exist.  They're not there.  Because when you, you know, when you cause an externality, that data is not even in your  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:08:54):**  transaction.  So when you're trying to optimize how much should this cost, there's no, well, all we  know is the template.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:01):**  There's no there's no limits.  So our idea is carbon analytics is to find a way to put those that data in every transaction  so that when you make a financial transaction, you have some understanding of those limits  
**[0:09:14-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:14):**  of the world.  And then if enough people, you know, I think there's enough people that care about those  limits that that starts to put a price on those transactions is the core idea.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:25):**  So in other words, you know, if you can, in every when you buy a sandwich, if you can  see how much carbon is in that sandwich, there's enough people that will say, Hey, we should  have we should, you know, not kill our climate to get sandwiches that enough people will  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:38):**  put a price on that.  Yeah, that sends a signal down to the suppliers and says, Hey, we should get lower carbon  plates and lower carbon mannays versus higher carbon.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:46):**  And that's how you create a system that can optimize around climate and all these limits  that we have.  And that's, that's possible.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:53):**  That's what you're saying.  That's Yeah, so what you're doing, that's pot.  That's incredible, isn't it?  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:09:57):**  Yeah.  So it took a while.  Yeah, it took us a couple of years of R&D in the UK.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:03):**  Started out of Oxford, lucky enough to get a number of grants from the EU and UK.  To develop the economic system so that now we can we have an engine that plugs financial  data in.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:15):**  So hooks up to QuickBooks and zero looks at each transaction a business makes and puts  a carbon footprint on it.  And then critically, we also look at not only the initial good, but the supply chain behind  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:26):**  it.  So, so business don't have to be signed up for that.  You can already analyze it.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:31):**  We or do they they have to be so if they want to look at their own business, they need to  sign up.  Okay, good.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:37):**  So if we if they're not signed up, we're still going to put a footprint on you.  Yeah.  So I was wondering just have you and we do the way we do that is we look at, have you  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:45):**  released any data about your carbon?  Probably not.  That's 99% of businesses.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:49):**  So if not, we look at what do we know about you as an industrial entity?  And where are you likely to spend your money?  So really, what we're doing is we're figuring out, I'm going to spend 100 pounds, where  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:10:58):**  does that 100 pounds go in the economy?  Who is now running to get you goods or services?  And what is that going to do to the environment?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:05):**  And we're calculating all that back for every transaction.  So if we know nothing about you, we know you're a sandwich shop.  And here's how sandwich shops typically are going to impact the economy to infinity.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:16):**  And that encourages the companies to then take responsibility, right?  That's the idea is we can if we get the buyers, the purchasers to start incorporating carbon  into their decision making, then you have a pressure and a reason for lower carbon companies  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:29):**  to be preferred over higher carbon.  And so then you can use the economic capitalist system, which is very efficient, but you can  now optimize on not just price, but price plus carbon.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:41):**  Apply that filter to that.  Exactly.  Yeah.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:44):**  And that's the core idea.  And then the, so that's the kind of the theory of change.  And then the next hard problem is how do we turn that into a business?  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:52):**  And what we realized is that carbon footprinting is kind of stuck in the stone ages.  It's very manual right now for companies.  Typically, a consultant will come in.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:11:58):**  They'll measure usually whatever is easy to measure or whatever, utility bill, very precise.  You've got how much power a company has used.  You can put a footprint on that quite easily.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:10):**  What's hard to put a footprint on is your IT services or your insurance company, the  full supply chain that actually supports what you do.  So that's usually ignored is the way that they do it.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:23):**  So we've realized that we can upgrade that whole industry really with our system and  automate it using the financial data.  So because it's data you've already got, we can process it with our technology, automate  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:34):**  it and make it a lot faster, a lot cheaper for companies.  So now we're starting to work with a lot of B Corps, a lot of small and midsize fashion  food type companies.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:42):**  Yeah.  So this is like macro or right down to micro at this stage, right?  Yeah.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:47):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:50):**  So it's really, what's your footprint as a business across the world?  You know, we, like, for example, we just worked with a company, Rebel Kitchen.  That's where I was going to go next.  
**[0:12:57-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:12:57):**  Who's with you?  Yeah, exactly.  Who's on board?  
**[0:13:00-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:00):**  So they're a great one.  They're like an alternative milk company here in the UK.  They're doing quite well.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:06):**  And they wanted to get their carbon footprint.  So we worked with them, used our system, and they not only got their company's footprint,  but their full global impact of their supply chain.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:15):**  Oh, wow.  So the whole thing's traceable right back.  Yeah.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:18):**  Yeah.  All to quote unquote to infinity, which is like basically until those, until that a hundred  pounds disappears in terms of impact on the economy, they got their footprint and then  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:27):**  they offset the entire thing.  So if you now go buy some alternative milk from Rebel Kitchen, it's truly offset.  And you can, you know, basically the carbon is now priced into that system.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:38):**  It's in the future world.  So what's in the, how do we offset it?  What is, what's involved with offsetting?  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:44):**  Yeah.  So offsetting is a whole, you know, we're not offsetters.  There's a whole other industry there.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:49):**  And effectively what offsetters do is they have projects around the world that cause  carbon to be up, you know, stored in some way.  So usually it's a reforestation project.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:13:59):**  Could be something like cook stoves where you're basically reducing the amount of fossil  fuels that are burned for cooking.  And those are good projects in and of themselves.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:09):**  But the almost the more important thing from our perspective is that they, they mean that  a company has put a price on carbon.  They've put a price on this externality and they've decided to operate in this world where  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:19):**  the climate matters and the offset is there, you know, here's the money to prove that that's  what they're doing.  And then that, that creates a forcing function within that company so that when they're making  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:31):**  a purchasing decision, they should be buying from the lower carbon supplier because that  means their offset is lower.  So they've, they're now taking that, that you know, initiative of, of around what they  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:42):**  want to do for the climate and they're pushing it into the supply chain because they're the  buyers.  That's the biggest power every company has is they're going to spend millions of pounds.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:49):**  Around the world, they're now going to get to say we want lower carbon options for what  we're buying.  Wow.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:14:56):**  Um, which, you know, that's how I think we can take the 2% of companies that really unfortunately  care about this and push that and make it an economy wide thing.  More in the bubble.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:07):**  Oh, sorry.  More inside the bubble.  Blow the bubble up.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:11):**  Yeah, exactly.  Lovely.  Blow the bubble up.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:14):**  Get, get, get more people involved.  Yeah.  So anyways, yeah.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:17):**  Maybe, maybe the long way of saying all that, but just a bit of music coming in the background  there.  Have you got that?  
**[0:15:23-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:23):**  No.  Okay.  Yeah.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:26):**  It's a little party in the park.  I thought we might be picking up on that then.  Yeah.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:29):**  So within the 2% you've got involved, so who else you got involved here in the UK?  How many of you got?  Yeah, so we, so we're still, we're still pretty young.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:37):**  So we, we launched the version one of our platform around two years ago.  We had around a thousand companies sign up.  Um, in some ways the mistake we made was that was free.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:45):**  So we got people kinda, you know, coming in, testing it out, but not really committed.  So we've just launched the second version of our platform, which is paid and we've got  about a dozen companies through.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:15:55):**  So still quite new.  As a business, we work with companies all over the world with airlines, power companies,  here in the UK, Hitachi Capital UK, British Gas, a number of B Corps that we work with.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:08):**  Yeah.  Food, fashion tends to be pretty, pretty popular ones.  But yeah, seeing, seeing interests everywhere.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:14):**  We um, um, yes, just starting work.  I think I can talk about with Ella's Kitchen.  Okay.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:20):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Brilliant.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:23):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, and uh, lots more fun ones on the way.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:26):**  I'm sure man.  So what was the spark?  What was, what was it?  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:29):**  What was it that triggered it for you?  This original, the idea, the concept, this is what I need to do now.  So I, you know, behind this run, it's been right.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:38):**  Okay.  For me, it's been, the parenthood really has been a big driver for me.  That's really interesting.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:44):**  I'm glad you say that.  Yeah.  Our CTO joined us with exactly that.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:47):**  He said, you know, I'm, I'm, I've worked on games and flight simulators and all that all  my life.  And I just had kids and we got, we got to do something about this.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:16:56):**  Yeah.  Because you just look at it and you think, you know, imagine what they're going to be  thinking in, I think Hugo mentioned something in one of the pods we did from Surfers Against  
**[0:17:05-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:05):**  Sewerage.  And he was saying about, um, whale oil or something that we would have been using, you  know, and then we, we move on so many years.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:13):**  And, and we think, Oh, what were we thinking?  What are we doing?  All these generations that have no concept of that.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:18):**  Yeah.  You know, and for my kids is saying, you know, 10 years time to look back and say, wow, what  a mess you all made.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:26):**  You know, it's going to be that we have to, I mean, we have to be doing something, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  And that's going back to that Greta Thunberg conversation.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:33):**  It's just, yeah.  You know, you guys aren't listening.  Yeah.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:36):**  Yeah.  And like sometimes it takes people from the outside to come in and say, have you ever  actually looked at this whole system?  
**[0:17:43-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:43):**  Certainly.  Yeah.  This is insane guys.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:46):**  Yeah.  Like I think, I think about automobiles that way.  Like imagine if you tried today, if, if cars and roads didn't exist to try to propose automobiles  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:17:53):**  as a system for transport, like I just imagine those conversations like, okay, so what we're  going to do is we're going to have people get in these two ton metal boxes and drive  at a hundred miles an hour, a hundred kilometers an hour down the road.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:07):**  And that's how they're going to get from point A to B. And you'd be like, well, what's going  to prevent them from, you know, hitting pedestrians and other people.  Well, we're going to paint a line on the road.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:14):**  Yeah.  That's going to be great.  Oh yeah.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:17):**  And it's going to burn flammable gas.  Yeah.  It's going to have a huge impact.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:20):**  It's insane.  Yeah.  You tried to propose it, but, but you know, here, here we are.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:24):**  And sometimes it takes someone from the outside to come in and say, well, that's dumb guys.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:30):**  And then it, then it just takes, then it takes a little bit of time for people to hear that  you're done.  What are you doing?  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:36):**  You know?  Yeah.  Cause that's that.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:39):**  Yeah.  Just going by my runs, what I've been doing is yes.  It's a flawed model, man.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:43):**  You know?  So going back to the spark.  Yeah.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:46):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, yeah.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:18:49):**  I mean, I mean, you know, so I spent a long time as an engineer working around the world,  did a lot of sustainable infrastructure projects, water, power systems, which is really great.  One thing I realized is that we, we had a really hard time pushing the clients, the  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:01):**  cities and companies that were working with towards green solutions.  And I was as a young engineer, almost, you know, jumping into Excel and trying to create  a model for why this was going to be better for the climate and better for their finances  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:13):**  longterm.  And I was like, this is, you know, really, we should be further along in this system.  So I kind of had that in the back of my head.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:19):**  Always wanted to start a company.  And then when, when I went to Oxford, just, you know, brought this question of how do  we, how do we shift this system in a meaningful way?  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:27):**  And what can I do as an, you know, an aspiring entrepreneur to do something about that?  And, you know, I think there's a couple of really big challenges in the world and there,  you know, there's sustainable transport, sustainable power, sustainable food.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:39):**  There's a lot of people working on those.  The one I saw that really not enough people were thinking about is how do we, how do we  shift our, how do we shift the incentives in the economy?  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:19:50):**  And without relying on government to do that.  And so that was the nexus is really hard challenge.  We did a kind of a brainstorm a few days at the business school with some, some other  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:04):**  brilliant people came out with this idea and I said, and we, you know, we were like, actually,  maybe there's some, some legs on this.  Let's, let's try to hash it out further.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:11):**  And it's, you know, been almost six years, but we've, we've now got a business model  and a technology that we think can work.  And is there any conversation in there?  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:21):**  Like, well, I was discussing with Hugo the other day, you know, how they, they, they  were one of the big voices in getting the charge on plastic bags, let's say, and changing  legislation.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:31):**  So is there that conversation that's happening between say, carbon analytics and the government?  Is there that kind of...  Not too much yet.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:41):**  So we're...  Do you feel as it grows that it's going to have a louder voice and it's...  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:46):**  There'll be more ears available.  Yeah.  So the conversation we're having right now is more at the, more at the carbon footprint  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:20:54):**  and offset space.  And it's around what should we be measuring for companies?  And we're really pushing the idea that you shouldn't just measure what is possible to  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:01):**  measure, you know, or based on whatever receipt, you know, easy to measure things, you should  always be measuring a hundred percent.  What's the full impact of a business?  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:12):**  Because right now we have, you know, some ideas around you're carbon neutral if you've  offset just your offset office downtown, but you're going to ignore your factory over in  China.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:21):**  And that's like, no, you have...  And the transport from that to that.  Yeah, and the transport and the farms.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:26):**  It's like, no, you haven't really done that.  So, so...  Full traceability.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:30):**  Exactly.  Yeah.  So we're pushing right now is that, okay, if we're going to be doing that, let's measure  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:34):**  a hundred percent.  Let's get to something that's comparable company to company to company.  And if, you know, I think if we can do that, that's going to create a lot bigger market  
**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:41):**  and pressure.  And then we, yeah, I would love to speak at the government level.  And we've had, I guess, some really early conversations here and over in the US.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:51):**  But, you know, I think we've got some growing to do before we'll...  Well, I think they have some growing to do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:21:57-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:21:57):**  That's true too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:00):**  I mean, it's a nascent space.  Where's the mic drop?  Tell me where the mic's from.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:03):**  I do it.  I was wondering if that was you.  Very good.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:06):**  No, no, no, no, it's just random.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it'd be nice for them to open their ears, wouldn't it?  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:15):**  I feel on multiple levels there.  But again, I guess it's more voices come in, the more they have to listen, it's becoming  that level, isn't it?  
**[0:22:24-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:24):**  Yeah.  So what about...  Because when we talk about sustainability, let's say sustainable fashion, and people  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:28):**  that I've spoken to that have tried to make shifts within their companies.  And it's the financial implications of that for them usually, you know.  And then the other end of that scale is from the consumer's perspective, that, oh my God,  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:42):**  I've had to pay whatever for a t-shirt, whereas a t-shirt from Fals Fashion is this much,  and I'm paying double for this.  So what about the financial implications for the company and then for the consumer within  
**[0:22:55-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:22:55):**  the company?  How does that look?  Yeah, I mean, it's a real thing and some things should be more expensive.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:01):**  I'm totally with that.  I really am.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:04):**  But yeah, I think that, you know, I guess I take a slightly different view on some of  this than a lot of people in the space in that I think if you've priced it properly  and everything is included in the price, you know, the negative environmental externalities,  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:19):**  there's nothing inherently wrong with say, Fals Fashion versus long-term fashion, you  know, versus this versus that.  It's just as long as it's priced properly, that should be okay.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:29):**  So I think what, you know, yeah, maybe a roundabout way of getting at it, but I think what you  need to do is if you can get the environmental externalities priced in, what you'll end up  finding is some things probably can be more efficient than they are.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:47):**  And that just because something has a low cost doesn't mean it's necessarily bad and  you can, by saving environmental impact, you can save money in fact, in a lot of ways.  Yeah, I don't know if I'm quite, quite,  
**[0:23:59-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:23:59):**  No, no, no, no, no, you're making sense there.  Okay.  Yeah.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:04):**  Yeah.  So, you know, like flying is a really interesting example where, you know, you might, you might  to do the environmentally preferable thing, you might take a drive from one place to another,  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:15):**  but actually if you, if you work it out, the, the fuel costs, you're going to spend more  fuel than you would on the flight.  And actually it turns out that that increased spending is an indication that you've actually  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:24):**  probably emitted more carbon than a flight would have taken.  By driving.  By driving.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:29):**  Yeah.  And that's certain routes in certain situations.  And especially if you're alone in a car and all that, but the, you know, really the economic  
**[0:24:36-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:36):**  system is a very good calculation engine.  It's a very good optimization engine.  And if we can put carbon and environmental impact right alongside price, it should be  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:45):**  able to optimize really well.  And probably we would find there's more abundance than we think in the world, not less.  So it doesn't need, doesn't mean if we include environmental impact that we're going to need  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:24:58):**  to all stop buying and enjoying the world.  I think, I think probably quite the opposite.  We'll enjoy it more.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:03):**  I mean, can you see it, can you see it as the, it would lead to the individual having  a handle on this as well.  I could say, right, okay, I'm going to fly, then I have to drive, then I can do this and  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:13):**  I can look at what would be the carbon footprint of all of that.  And I could calculate it over time.  Do you think that's possible?  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:19):**  Do you think that's moving, shifting that?  Yeah, I think it's definitely possible.  I mean, we looked at it.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:24):**  And there's a couple of companies that do it in the space and they've done it even with  credit cards, which is really interesting.  I think the challenge has been the business model around it.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:32):**  Our consumer, is there enough spending willingness there amongst consumers to be able to build  the system and then build the offsets around it?  And so far that's, yeah, hasn't panned out yet, but certainly could.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:47):**  If we had enough interested people, that's something we could do with our technology.  It's such an interesting space, isn't it?  Because it all feels like it's so bizarre because it feels like it's all at this acorn  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:25:55):**  level.  What do you mean acorn level?  The acorn is waiting for this amazing oak tree to grow from it.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:02):**  You know, it does feel that the whole space feels like that.  I think that suddenly people are listening and it's like there's been enough people speaking  in the space, but suddenly it's opening up.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:12):**  I think that's right.  And it's, yeah, I mean, it's also challenging because, you know, as much as we want to do  as individuals, to some degree, we don't hold all the power directly.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:26):**  But the power that we do hold is the power to persuade these companies that this is something  we care about.  So we can't necessarily, we don't necessarily have enough products on the market where we  
**[0:26:34-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:34):**  can buy good flights or bad flights.  But what we can do is say, hey, we want, we need to change this system.  And that's what we really need to be demanding a change in the system and being angry, not  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:44):**  at, you know, Al Gore for taking a flight, but angry that flights emit carbon that damages  the planet in the first place.  Yeah.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:52):**  And it's, I don't know, it's an interesting time.  Yeah.  And all of this is very new.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:26:56):**  You know, carbon measurement rules are very haphazard and exist, don't exist all over  the place.  Carbon legislation is very new and barely exists all over the place.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:04):**  So we have all these people trying to do something, but we don't quite have the direct tools yet  that are powerful enough.  Okay.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:12):**  So how do businesses get involved?  So, I mean, really easy.  Go to CO2analytics.com.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:19):**  Very quick to link your finances, especially if you're on Xero, sign up, link your finances.  We charge an annual fee for companies meant to be 90% less than a consultant would charge  and yeah, you know, and if you can't afford that and are just excited about what we're  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:34):**  doing, like, please do get in touch.  We're always looking for champions and people who can help push us to their suppliers or  find other ways to push this.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:42):**  Or help connect in some way or another.  Yeah, exactly.  Boom.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:48):**  Wonderful.  Yeah.  And, you know, I really appreciate what you're doing on this run raising awareness.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:27:53):**  I mean, it's kind of like, it's one big long chain from people all the way down to our  supply chain.  We need people at every stage of the chain pushing and pulling and pulling and pulling  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:03):**  towards a better cleaner economy.  Yeah.  And it's not just business, it's individuals, isn't it, within that, you know?  
**[0:28:11-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:11):**  So as an individual, how do I get involved?  So if I'm not a business and I'm an individual and I'm thinking, right, okay, is there a  member?  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:18):**  Is there becoming a member or is there something that we can do to assist or?  Yeah, I mean, we don't have anything like that.  Interesting idea.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:25):**  I think the biggest thing that we'd love you to do is, and maybe we could put together  an email to do this, but just ask your companies, ask your favorite companies, you know, what's  their carbon footprint?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:34):**  What are they doing around climate?  What's their plan to live in a world, you know, create a world that's compatible with  1.5 degrees?  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:44):**  And if they don't have one, you know, come to us and we can help them do that.  That's a good place to finish, man.  That's good.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:51):**  That's brilliant.  Thank you.  Thank you.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn#t=0:28:54):**  Cheers.  Thank you.  Thank you.

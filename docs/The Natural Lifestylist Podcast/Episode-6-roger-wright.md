**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:00):**  Hi, I'm Tony Riddle and this is the Natural Lifestylist podcast.  So way back in December I had this crazy idea to run from Land's End to John O'Groats in  just 30 days.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:12):**  But I wasn't just going to run it, I was going to run it barefoot to raise funds for environmental  charities and collaborate with world leading experts to raise awareness and money for six  organisations fighting the top sustainability issues of our time.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:28):**  I knew running barefoot would raise many a socially extreme eyebrow and with that eyebrow  raising behaviour I would be able to provide a perfect platform to highlight the importance  of connecting with our environment and those key sustainability issues of our time.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:45):**  So peeps, let me introduce you to the man that is Roger Wright.  Roger Wright is a packaging technologist with over 20 years experience designing out waste  and designing in solutions that work.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:58):**  Roger is inspired by a future where the activity of packaging is understood more holistically  and can evolve within the context of an effective circular economy.  He also believes that when packaging is integral to building a successful brand costing only  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:13):**  a tenth of the goods it protects and promotes but with a net positive impact on the world,  we should all love the last 10%.  Roger and I spent a fair bit of time together and I feel I learnt so much from the conversation.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:27):**  And if the conversation wasn't enough to go by he also joined me for the final 10 mile  run of the day and an ice bath workshop with Arthur Paulings and Martin Batroux from the  Nice Collective.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:39):**  Anyway enough waffle, I hope you enjoy the sustainability chat.  So I'm here with a man called Roger, Roger Wright.  Good afternoon.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:50):**  Good afternoon Roger.  You've heard me talk about in multiple podcasts now about Yehudi Gordon and Roger is the son  in law of Yehudi Gordon.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:00):**  Officially this year.  There you go officially this year.  We got married in March.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:03):**  Isn't that lovely.  Yeah.  So Roger.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:06):**  No I didn't get married to Yehudi obviously.  The way I said that was like I'm married to Titania of course.  So Roger's here from M&S so we're going to be talking about, what are we going to talk  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:18):**  about Roger?  What are we on for?  Well I want to just quickly say why am I here really?  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:22):**  Yeah why are you here?  Why am I here?  What are you doing behind the mic right now?  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:27):**  I'm the son in law of Yehudi, the great Yehudi Gordon.  I think we can call him your student can we?  Of 79 years.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:34):**  I think we're both students.  We're all students put it that way.  I learned just as much from Yehudi as I think.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:39):**  So it was Yehudi who introduced me to you.  Yeah.  And we did a little bit of work before and most significantly after I had a bad road  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:48):**  traffic accident.  Right yeah.  And you literally straightened me out and then more recently you taught me how to run.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:56):**  Let's cover this.  Let's just go back to the car accident.  What happened in the car accident?  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:00):**  Because that was quite a big thing talking about sustainability.  It's about how do you get back from that.  Yeah well I was crossing the Zebra crossing on the way to work on the way to the station  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:10):**  to go to work.  It was a bit dusky.  Yeah.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:13):**  The car approached from the left.  I thought it was slowing down.  So I crossed and it turned out they were slowing down but not for me for the bend that came  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:21):**  afterwards.  Wow.  It took my legs from under me.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:24):**  I had no idea.  I had no clear sign that was going to happen.  So I went straight up in the air and I landed on my head like that.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:31):**  Literally took all my body weight on my head.  Yeah.  I immediately stood up.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:35):**  It was in the shock of it all I think.  It's amazing the adrenaline right.  What else is broken?  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:40):**  You know I was trying to feel my body and thank God there was a passerby who happened  to be a nurse.  I said stop, sit down, you might have done something a lot worse than what was obviously  
**[0:03:51-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:51):**  happening in my head.  Yeah.  And she looked after me until the ambulance came.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:55):**  And luckily of course I didn't have any severe injuries.  I had a very nasty head injury.  But that healed up.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:02):**  I've still got a nice scar on my head.  But my back and my neck were scrunched up really badly after that.  And when I first saw you obviously I was coming to see you because I was a cyclist at that  
**[0:04:15-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:15):**  point.  Yeah.  Very hunched over.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:18):**  Yeah, yeah.  And I needed a better posture.  But that accident made it 10 times worse.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:24):**  And you helped me a lot obviously.  Straightened my back, showed me how to stand and how to walk and then I've also recently  had to run.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:32):**  So I've been doing a lot of running recently.  Brilliant.  And in the vivos of course.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:37):**  Yeah man.  And that's part of the reason why I wanted to see you on this.  Because we're going to get the run together aren't we?  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:41):**  I want to do a little bit of a run.  That would be nice.  But the other thing I noticed when you, well it occurred to me when you posted about this  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:48):**  adventure.  I realised that when you were meeting all these people throughout the journey.  Something that would be coming up a lot would be plastic waste.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:59):**  And in particular plastic packaging waste.  Yeah like zero waste is a big topic for people right now.  Talking to a lot of people, sustainability people who are quite rightly concerned about  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:08):**  it.  So I thought, and I wonder if I can add anything to the conversation.  Can I come and talk to you about trying to tell you what the industry is doing.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:17):**  Because some people may not realise there's a lot going on in the background.  Maybe not as quickly as some people would like.  Well it's an interesting one isn't it?  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:27):**  Because people expect things to change overnight.  It's not, we don't have much patience here do we?  And it's the, and if it was to happen overnight, could you imagine the cost implications of  
**[0:05:37-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:37):**  that?  And the next complaint would be, oh this is so expensive now.  Why are we paying so much money?  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:40):**  So it has to be almost like drip fed in a way you know.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's interesting because I was, people like me, packaging technologists who designed.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:49):**  I just got to start, I mean it's such a great title isn't it?  A packaging technologist, I love it.  Well I started my career 25 years ago as a packaging designer.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:00):**  I would physically design the packaging, I wouldn't do the graphic design, I'd physically  do the structure of packaging.  And then more recently in the last 10 years I've become a packaging technologist.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:09):**  Which is basically, you're not only looking at the structural design, you're looking at  the specification of the materials, how they're made, are they sustainably sourced?  You know, and all of the technical aspects as well as the design aspects.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:21):**  You know, and that's the job I've been doing for the last 10 years within a retailer, in  a major retailer.  I happen to be at M&S at the moment, I've been there eight years.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:29):**  So I've seen a lot of change over that time.  So it's a 20 year period.  25 year period.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:35):**  25 year period, but eight years with M&S.  Eight years with M&S.  But since day one I was trained as a designer to make the most of the materials given to  
**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:42):**  us.  So it's in our packaging technologist and designers, just use the least amount of material  possible.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:49):**  So it's already in that DNA.  It's already in our DNA.  And until recently we were kind of, we were in the shadows of these big organizations.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:56):**  And then David Attenborough came along, Blue Planet 2, and suddenly, actually, you're the  guy, you can probably help us fix this and do something about it.  And actually, people like me have been working on these ideas for 10, 15 years.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:09):**  And you're like behind the scenes, finally.  Finally.  And you can bring forward these ideas you've been working on that probably back and back  
**[0:07:17-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:17):**  many, many times.  Because now it's so much more important.  Not only from a, cynically it's from a PR perspective, and your reputation as a company  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:26):**  is a threat if you don't do something about it.  But actually, a company like M&S just wants to do the right thing as well.  And most of the retailers do as well, to be fair.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:37):**  The likes of me are now helping all these companies, big retailers and brands, do the  right thing when it comes to plastic packaging.  And I guess, like I said, the other thing I want to get across to you today, and the  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:48):**  reason I'm here is I wanted to try and tell you about some of those things.  Not because I'm not an advocate for the plastic industry, by far from it.  But I think people need to understand that there are unintended consequences of potentially  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:02):**  switching out plastic into something else.  It might not be the right thing to do.  Okay, well it's good to have that conversation then, isn't it?  
**[0:08:09-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:09):**  Yeah.  Okay, man.  Let's do it.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:12):**  Let's go there.  So there's probably four things that we do as an industry, and specifically I do and  M&S do.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:20):**  And then we pass it to drill a bit deeper into that if you want to.  Please, yeah.  So the first thing we do, and as I say, it's in our DNA, we try and make, we try and just,  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:27):**  we try and remove plastic wherever we can.  And we've been, obviously as I say, we do that anyway, but the Blue Planet effect has  put that on steroids in the last 18 months.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:36):**  So we desperately try and, we turn over every stone, look at every bit of packaging, say  what can we just take off?  Because fundamentally that's what we've got to do.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:42):**  We've got to just remove plastic.  It's very difficult because we're potentially hamstrung by a long supply chain, brutal supply  chain where products potentially get damaged or go off, get soiled or whatever.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:58):**  So we have to work within those constraints at the moment.  And it's, you know, I'm a, we're trying to, as well as that, we're trying to just reduce  the amount of packaging as well.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:14):**  But actually that's not a sustainable, that's not sustainable in the long term.  Yeah.  Because if a business grows and you've reduced, say, a certain amount of packaging on a certain  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:23):**  line, you're still going to produce more plastic going forward.  Yeah.  So you're generating more plastic.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:28):**  You might have produced it by 10%, but if you're selling more stuff, you're creating  more plastic.  So we recognize that as in our industry.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:36):**  That's not the, it's the right thing to do, but it's not, it's the first step.  So it's factoring in it with growth at the same time.  Yeah.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:43):**  So the second thing we obviously, the second thing we do, and I suppose this is more recent  really in our industry, is we're trying to redesign the way it works.  We've got to sort of relearn plastics, rethink how we use it, and try and redesign if we  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:57):**  can, and that supply chain that I described as an Achilles heel for us.  So completely reinvent almost for how we sell products.  And that's quite difficult.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:08):**  You know, we've got some examples of that.  The third thing we do, the third thing we are doing as an industry, all the retailers  have got together and all the brands, and we voluntarily have agreed through consultation  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:19):**  with the government to pay a lot more money for the collection and clean up plastic waste  in the country.  So we pay roughly about 10% of that at the moment as retailers.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:32):**  The new law which will come in, new laws which will come in over the next three years could  times that by 10.  So typically a business, a big retailer is paying two to three million pounds for that  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:43):**  at the moment.  That got to 20, 30, 40, and 40 million pounds that businesses will be asked to pay.  Wow.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:50):**  And we're happy to do that.  Yeah, yeah.  With one caveat.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:53):**  Yeah.  We want to see where that money goes.  We want to see that money going into new infrastructure for recycling or for –  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:00):**  Where the resources are.  We want to physically see the – we want to see what that money is spent on.  For example, if compostable packaging becomes a thing, we want an infrastructure for compostable  
**[0:11:11-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:11):**  packaging.  Yeah, like we were having that discussion earlier.  I didn't realize that.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:14):**  It doesn't exist at the moment.  So basically what we were discussing earlier is that, you know, plastic bags – who is  it, Bart?  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:20):**  Who is it at the moment?  Co-ops.  Co-ops.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:23):**  They've introduced compostable bags, which are great.  But if the refuse company turn up and arrive and they see it, then they may be pulling  those out.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:30):**  Correct.  But if they're left within the compost, then they're compostable.  But if they're pulled out, then they're not.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:35):**  So until everybody switches to compostable bags, that model still isn't trusted, right?  Correct.  Yeah.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:44):**  And what the co-ops have done is great, actually, because they're slowly introducing that  bag into parts of the UK that does have food waste collection.  Only 60 percent of the UK has food waste collections, and only about half of those trust the bags  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:57):**  that they're getting in that waste.  So the co-op are doing a managed approach to that, but they're also lobbying government  to say, come on, guys, let's have a compostable system that works, because there's nothing  
**[0:12:08-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:08):**  at the moment.  Yeah, because it's like going back to the first conversation we had in the podcast we  had, which is with Hugo Tagholm.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:14):**  So they were one of the big voices in amongst that, that they were getting the surcharge  onto plastic bags, the 5P charge put onto plastic bags.  And that's a matter of changing legislation again, because otherwise people would just  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:25):**  be going in and grabbing plastic bags anyway.  And firstly, you know, to the cynic, it was like, oh, people are just going to pay five  pence, but no, it made an 85 percent reduction difference.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:36):**  So it has to change.  Again, it has to be the bigger picture, it needs to change at that government level.  Isn't it?  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:41):**  Well, at least the fourth thing I think that we tried to do as a company, that's change  behaviours.  This is the hardest of the four things, is to change behaviours.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:49):**  What's normalised?  Yeah, and bags is a good example where M&S actually introduced a charge for bags before  it was law.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:57):**  So probably at the same time that Service Against Sewage are doing their thing.  Oh, so you were already charging before the law changed.  We introduced, we had a charge.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:03):**  Oh, wow, brilliant.  We saw a reduction in bag use.  There you go.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:07):**  And then because of who we are, people tend to sort of watch M&S and they tend to follow,  but obviously the law had to change for everybody to do it.  But there's still more we can do.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:19):**  So can I ask what M&S, what were they doing?  So if you introduced a charge of five p, say, per bag, where would the five, so talk about  traceability, where does the five p go?  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:30):**  We used, we put that into different charities at the time.  And now that's mandated in law as well, so you've got to pay a certain amount to a charity.  So we did that and we continue to do that for our food bags that we still sell.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:44):**  Brilliant.  But we've just, just last week actually, we've opened a new store in Clapham Common.  I think it's Clapham or maybe near the station.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:52):**  Okay.  Brand new store, completely plastic free of bags, no bags.  Wow.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:58):**  And something else that was interesting, we actually introduced a water tap.  It's not revolutionary, is it?  We've introduced a water tap so people can go refill their bottles.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:06):**  Hopefully we can change, we can sort of change behaviors.  What a shift though, because it's all happening, isn't it?  It's like, it's only one store.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:13):**  Isn't that, but that's, I mean, surely that should be already, that should be on the news  or it should be on some kind of advertisement already because that's, that's how you bring  around, that's being the change.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:24):**  And then others will have to align with that, won't they?  Because we start to get into that competitive corporate kind of model eventually, don't  we?  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:31):**  You know, there is a, there is a, there is a thing though out there that companies, big  companies are scared of talking too much about their, their green initiatives.  I saw a piece about this.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:40):**  For fear of being called green washers.  Yep.  They're worried that they'll be client, they'll be green washing the, you know, their customers.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:48):**  I think they're all, yeah, I think I read something about, they're also concerned that,  you know, some of them are doing amazing work.  I mean, absolutely phenomenal work, but it isn't 100% traceable.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:59):**  So their concern is we put ourselves out there as this sustainable environmental brand.  Yeah.  Then someone's going to be able to pick on something, you know, and it's a bit like the  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:08):**  individual, isn't it?  You know, because there is that, that can happen.  Yeah.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:14):**  You know?  So we've got to, we've got to try and change behaviors and there's, there's, you know,  there's a number of ways we can do it.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:19):**  So we've done it on bags, trying to do it with water if we can, you know, get people  to, you don't need to buy, you don't need to sell water.  In the future, who is going to buy a bottle of water in a supermarket?  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:27):**  I'm not sure that's, that will be a thing.  But the convenience of the product and the packaging is so good.  Customers aren't easily going to change what they do.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:39):**  And that's part of the problem in a way.  Yeah, I think, again, going back to Hugo's conversations, because they're bringing in,  you know, they're fighting for legislation at the moment around bottle banks, right,  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:50):**  plastic bottle banks.  And then at least you know that that plastic bottle bank, the plastics can be recycled  and upcycled, let's say.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:59):**  Part of that, you know, that 40 million potentially that we pay as a retailer more, part of that  will be, we'll go into the DRS system.  The DRS system is being launched in Scotland now.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:12):**  Okay.  The Deposit Return Scheme.  Yep.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:15):**  A lot of acronyms in retail, I'm really sorry.  No, it's good.  DRS.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:20):**  The DRS.  The Deposit Return Scheme.  Deposit Return Scheme.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:23):**  It's an old fashioned idea, right?  Yeah.  Take your bottle back, get your 10p or whatever.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:26):**  I remember taking bottles of pop back to the newsagent.  But that is, that is, that's, customers got to think, ah, I've got to be bothered to take  it back.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:36):**  But this could change behaviors, but not just on bottles.  It could potentially become more ingrained in terms of what sort of other, what other  things could we take back.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:45):**  Could we be renting our packaging in the future?  All of it, potentially.  Wow, because we, because we have deliveries from Riverford, right?  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:54):**  And Riverford, they come in cardboard boxes every week.  And we put the cardboard boxes back out.  They take the cardboard boxes away and upturn the new, the new boxes.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:02):**  Yeah, yeah.  Which again is a great, I think a great system, great model.  And if I'm right, Riverford also, I suppose this goes to the wider point, Riverford only  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:09):**  sell you seasonal fruit and veg.  Is that right?  Well, some of it, you know, they can do, but I think in the UK, we'd suffer a bit.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:16):**  You know, people would just get sick of eating Brassica Group.  Yeah.  Because I think some of it does, he does ship it in France, Spain.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:27):**  But I think there's a, there's a, again, he's the ethical part of that.  That's, that's the standard, I think.  Because I think a bigger conversation we have to have as an industry and with the customers  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:37):**  is the carbon footprint of what we're doing is counterintuitive to some of the things  that you think are bad.  Yeah.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:45):**  The carbon footprint of a plastic bag is so much lower than a paper bag.  It's not even funny.  It's tiny compared to a paper bag.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:53):**  And yet, you feel like that paper bag is the right solution.  But actually, when you look into it, let's reinvent what we're doing over plastic.  Let's try and remove bags altogether or do something completely different rather than  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:04):**  introduce something that could be worse for the environment.  Yeah, I wonder what's the carbon imprint of the compostable bag then?  How does that work?  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:13):**  They're pretty high.  So if a plastic bag is one on the scale, a compostable bag is probably a three or a four.  And then a paper bag is probably a nine or a 10, looking at the carbon impact.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:24):**  I mean, it depends what you do with it, of course, but that's roughly where it sits.  So you can imagine on a bigger scale, the impact, if suddenly a big supermarket changes  to paper bags overnight.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:35):**  Yeah, and it suddenly gets to a confusing conversation, that, doesn't it?  Because plastic bags are going to be around forever, of course, aren't they?  You know, compostable, I guess, would be the answer then.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:44):**  If it's a three on the scale.  And then can we offset that?  Yeah.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:49):**  You know, so another guy, I want to introduce you to Michael, actually.  I interviewed Michael Thornton the other day.  He's the CEO of Carbon Analytics.  
**[0:18:57-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:57):**  Did he used to work for DS Smith?  I recognize that name.  I think, well, I used to work for a company called DS Smith, and I think Mike...  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:04):**  Maybe.  Maybe.  Years ago.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:07):**  Brilliant brain again.  I mean, for all businesses, even down to the coffee shop now.  Yeah.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:13):**  They're, you know, it's a big, big companies down to the coffee shop.  And so that you could go in and you could look at, let's say, it was a sandwich, for  instance.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:22):**  That sandwich, they can tell you what the carbon print is of that sandwich versus another  sandwich versus something else, which is going to be incredible when it moves in that direction.  Of course, of course.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:32):**  So then that comes down to the individual then making that decision too, which would  then drive, oh, this is what we want to be selling based on, yeah, people's preference.  Yeah, getting into human behavior again, aren't you?  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:44):**  I mean, I'd love to say to all our customers, go vegan.  That's going to save the planet.  That's going to reduce our carbon footprint and massively.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:52):**  But nine people are going to tell me to go away.  One person might give it a try.  You've got to make that decision for yourself to change the world, if you like.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:02):**  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  So I went meat-free and milk-free this year.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:07):**  Brilliant.  So I stopped, I've just stopped, and I'm loving it.  It's brilliant.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:11):**  And that's even, I mean, that's a huge conversation itself because I had a, I did an interview  with someone that's the ethical butcher, and we talked about holistic management.  So holistic management, if you imagine you had like the grazing animal, and originally  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:25):**  you would have had an apex predator that would move the animals around, right?  So they, if you had a field this big, they would get the grazing animals and they act  like the apex predator and they move the animals into the, into this segment, let's say, right?  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:41):**  Into, say, a 20th of this square.  And then the animals are then just, they're grazing, grazing, graze, poop, mash it all  in, and that sequesters carbon.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:52):**  So there's this, there's a conversation that hasn't quite come through yet.  There's more to it.  There's a bigger picture there, what I'm discovering more and more with that holistic management.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:01):**  It sounds very interesting.  And then you can move them onto land that's basically, it's not being used.  And then we can start to change, change the landscape again.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:10):**  That's the thing about compostable and biodegradable plastics.  If you don't do that, you're sequestering the carbon for as long as you can keep that  material in the system.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:19):**  So if you can reuse and recycle plastic over and over again, that's locked up there.  As soon as you put it in a compost heap, that carbon is into the atmosphere.  And that's one of the disadvantages, one of the few disadvantages of a biodegradable or  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:34):**  a compostable piece of packaging.  Ideally, we want to keep that in the system.  That's kind of the recycling is way down the hierarchy.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:42):**  And so is compostable, really, you really want to keep that material in the system if  you can.  So we do a lot, we did a lot of work to try and put recycled material into our products  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:51):**  where you can.  And customers are coming around to that as well.  For example, we've removed the black food trays.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:59):**  I'm sure you don't eat microwave meals, but a lot of people do.  And those historically would have been black.  And they're very difficult to recycle.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:07):**  Not impossible, but very difficult.  So now most retailers now come out of that black.  Waitros, to their credit, have now said to customers actually, it might be pink this  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:18):**  tomorrow, it might be yellow the day after, it might be a different color, basically,  because we don't know necessarily what recycler is coming into the system.  Oh, wow.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:25):**  We take whatever we can get, and you get a food trade safe, it's clean, but it might  be a different color tomorrow.  Don't worry about it.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:32):**  You go back five years, maybe even two years, marketeers are going, that's no way, I want  my black tray and I don't want it to change color ever.  So now the customers are coming around to the idea that things, recycled material is  
**[0:22:45-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:45):**  a good thing, and it is still a safe thing to have your food.  And as you say, it stays in the system.  Exactly, yeah.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:51):**  So we're working hard to make sure we put recycled material into packaging.  And one very exciting bit of technology that isn't ours but we're using is a system whereby  any of the nearly nasty, horrible, unrecyclable plastic can now be turned back into what is  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:08):**  called plaques, basically a waxy oil, which is basically you turn that back into plastic  again.  So this technology exists.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:18):**  I think one of the local authorities in Scotland has now got one of these machines.  And the way that it's been designed, it's modular, so you can just be bolted onto any  existing material recycling facility.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:28):**  It's relatively inexpensive and it cracks the plastic down to almost its constitute  parts into oil and then potentially you can use that again either as fuel or as oil to  make something else.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:39):**  This is quite new.  So we've launched the take-back scheme in eight stores where people can bring all that  nasty plastic back that historically was really impossible to recycle.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:49):**  And we're sending it to this plant to turn it into oil.  Before we do that, we're going to turn it into playground equipment first.  We're going to use the first batch for that.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:57):**  And then hopefully we'll roll this out next year.  So that's like introducing a DRS?  Well, I suppose it's a stage before the DRS.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:04):**  It's free for the customer.  If they want to bring it back, and this is where the behaviors comes in, I want to persuade  all our customers to bring all of their plastics back.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:12):**  Yeah, because they're almost needing incentives sometimes.  As it goes into the black bin.  So now I'm telling everyone I can listen.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:20):**  Once a week, put all your nasty plastic in a carrier bag, tie it up, bring it in and  put it in the take-back box at the store.  And all of that gets genuinely recycled.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:31):**  It's not getting shipped to China.  It's not getting burnt or landfilled.  It's actually getting recycled into something that could potentially be remade into another  
**[0:24:34-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:34):**  plastic.  Wow.  So this is exciting.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:37):**  And over and over and over again.  So there's loads and loads of innovation out there.  And if nothing else, you know, Attenborough and all the wave of, quite rightly, the criticism  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:51):**  about ocean waste is pushing innovation now really, really strongly.  So people like me can actually go, brilliant, we can put some of these ideas back into the  market.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:00):**  It's amazing that just it's so reactive, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:06):**  It is reactive.  And then people like yourself that have been proactive for a certain amount of time, then  it's like, wow, I can find it finally where it's happening.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:13):**  But I suppose you just take a, I take a step back and go, okay, fair enough.  I don't, I'm not a, I'm not a, I told you so type of person.  Okay, that's, that's being patient in the process.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:24):**  Let's revisit these ideas.  Yeah.  Something I did probably six years ago is I grew packaging out of mushrooms.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:33):**  So we did a trial that we can actually grow packaging in a dark space.  Yeah.  And the mycelium starts to react, but you've put it in a mold, you can mold it into different  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:43):**  shapes.  So we did, we actually did it and we can use it as protective packaging.  You get a, I don't know, a washing machine or a big heavy item in a box that needs protection.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:53):**  Yes.  Rather than having that horrible polystyrene around them and the plastic packaging.  Yeah.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:58):**  So we, you know, we were doing things like that years ago and now I'm reintroducing that  potentially into, into our world.  Wow, man.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:05):**  It's just one of them.  It's one of a hundred and, you know, hundreds of different innovations that we can now revisit,  you know.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:11):**  So I, you know, I wanted, you know, I wanted to get across that there was a lot going on  out there.  There's a lot of positive stuff behind the scenes, isn't there?  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:18):**  You know, and I think for anyone listening is just, you know, again, it's being patient  within the process and understand that, yeah.  But what you're, what you're, what you're doing and what's happening out there with  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:28):**  surface against sewage and everybody else is brilliant because it just, it makes people  stop and think, should I reuse that bag?  Should I use it, you know, buy a reusable bottle instead of, you know, keep buying a  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:39):**  bottle of water.  Yeah.  And at the same time, just be patient with yourself and remove anxiety.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:44):**  I was saying earlier, you know, there's been occasions when we've needed plastic bottles  on this run.  It's just, there hasn't been an alternative.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:51):**  And I could, I could easily go into, oh my God, I've got to do this.  But, you know, be patient with the process and just give yourself a break a bit, you  know.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:00):**  Yeah.  And I think until, as we said, the bigger players and legislations change and things  are just normalized, then that, that, that voice will quieten anyway.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:11):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  With everything else that's going on in the country, this is, this stuff will happen.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:16):**  The new taxes will come in, retailers will start to pay a bit more.  Hopefully we'll see the infrastructure develop.  So one thing the government has promised to do is to mandate food collection, food waste  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:26):**  collection across the UK, well across England, but it should, it should follow throughout  the UK.  Okay.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:33):**  Which means then you could potentially build behind that, you can build a, an infrastructure  for compostable biodegradable packaging, potentially if you could put it in the food waste.  So then you can tell everybody or you could potentially have everybody using the same  
**[0:27:46-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:46):**  kind of packaging and all going into the right, to the right place.  Wow.  You just don't want to make it too complicated for customers.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:51):**  I mean, I see, you see those, you see those bins sometimes where there's probably five,  five different holes and you've got to think, oh, which, which hole.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:59):**  Yeah, yeah.  We need to simplify that.  They just want one bin for the recycler and it gets dealt with and it gets dealt with  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:05):**  properly.  You know, ideally we don't want to put it in there in the first place, but what's left  over, we can physically recycle.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:12):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I work a lot on in, in.com, e-com.  Yeah.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:18):**  And any business will tell you that's, that's where the growth is.  The only, it's the only way, it's the only place the growth is.  Yeah.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:23):**  So a lot of the nightmares you see is e-com packaging, big boxes for the fresh air, you  know, and a lot of waste appear, a lot of waste there, but that is something that we're  working on too.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:34):**  So we're looking at trying to improve all of that.  Yeah, I appreciate that.  You know, James here, we had a issue with James's bag and lost the drone and the laptop  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:42):**  and cameras and new stuff's been delivered.  Yeah.  And just watching just the, just the amount of packaging that comes through.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:50):**  We order it on Amazon, it arrives.  Yeah.  Really, is this, is this necessary?  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:54):**  Well, interesting, Amazon have just, just about to make it policy fit for them.  And obviously everyone who wants to sell stuff has to use Amazon now.  They've made it policy and it's a brilliant idea.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:06):**  They've basically said to the likes of, you know, a drone maker.  Yeah.  So what it used to do, your packaging used to come to us, we'd over wrap it and send  
**[0:29:14-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:14):**  it to a customer.  Actually what you've got to do now is make that packaging fit for the whole journey.  We mandate that.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:21):**  If you want to work with us, you've got to make that packaging right for the whole journey.  Wow.  All Amazon really do now is just light touch, pass it onto the customer.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:29):**  So there's no extra packaging going on that drone box, for example.  So from a certain weight and size of product from the first of October, I think, it's mandated.  If you want to work with Amazon, you have to follow this process.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:41):**  They call it frustration free packaging.  Frustration free.  Nice name.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:45):**  It's nice.  But it's a brilliant idea.  FFP.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:48):**  You know, whatever you think of Amazon, that's an actually brilliant, that's a brilliant  idea because it just makes people think about the end to end piece of packaging rather than  just adding packaging throughout their supply chain.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:00):**  So I can see that.  I can see other big online companies following that.  Have MNS got anything in place where you can look at full traceability?  
**[0:30:07-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:07):**  Is there anything coming in there?  In terms of packaging?  Yeah, I mean, we're already fully traceable.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:12):**  So we know exactly where we know.  I mean, we produce a hell of a lot of paper packaging.  And we do something called the wood report every year.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:20):**  So we actually trace all of the paper, obviously comes from wood back to almost the forest.  And in terms of plastic, we've got to, we fully trace it back to the producer of the  plastic as well.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:32):**  And so for the customer, they can find that anywhere?  Well, they can if they choose to ask.  Okay.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:39):**  So we don't publish that information on the website.  What we do do, we have a map of our vendors, our product vendors.  So you can see where all your products coming from.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:48):**  And then obviously behind the scenes, we've got all that due diligence on the packaging  as well.  I think it's well worth doing because I did a workshop with Lululemon.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:57):**  And Lululemon, they invited me in and I went in there, personal shopper, this lady take  me round.  And she just, I think these will be great for you.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:08):**  And then they gave me a cup of tea and then out I went.  Anyway, posted about it because it was a nice experience.  And I'm doing a workshop with them and I got some clothes out of it.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:18):**  And then someone posted in immediately, immediately about sustainability and Lululemon.  And I was like, right, okay, let's have a look.  So when you go on, again, they go all the way through it.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:30):**  So we're trying to be as transparent as possible.  Here's we did a full carbon report in whichever year.  And it's all there.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:38):**  If you look, you can find it.  And I thought that was brilliant because it was actually an opportunity to say, well,  again, you can't expect a company to change overnight.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:46):**  It's a massive organization.  But these are the things they're doing.  And this is the direction they're heading in, you know.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:51):**  And we can see that.  Reporting of what we do is really important to us.  And we're not perfect, but we're working hard to improve that, you know, the transparency.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:03):**  So yeah, we've got that.  We've got information.  Anyone wishes to find it, you know, wishes to have it.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:08):**  Sounds like you're doing amazing work.  There's stuff there on there.  You know, it's stuff we've discussed already on those, it's closing me away because it's...  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:14):**  I mean, no two days are the same when you work in packaging.  If you're touching every part of the business, you know, everybody needs packaging.  Everybody somewhere needs somehow to get something from A to B, from B to C, you know, and you're  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:27):**  the people that facilitate that.  It's a fun industry.  And it's even more interesting at the moment with everything that's going on.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:34):**  So I say bring it on.  Anyone who's got issues with plastic, bring it on.  We're happy to help.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:39):**  Okay.  What do you see the progression over the next, let's say, five years?  What's the over the next...what's coming over the next five years from a packaging technologist  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:49):**  prediction?  From a sort of meta level, I think reusable packaging is going to be more and more prevalent  in our world.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:58):**  I mean, one thing I...obviously, we have a big fashion business.  And the next thing I think from a fashion point of view is rental clothes.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:08):**  Jasmine was talking about this.  With rental clothes, you're going to have reusable bags.  You're going to have to have products going backwards and forwards constantly.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:17):**  You can't have single-use plastic on those products.  If you become a rental business, you've got to have a reusable system.  And I think people go, oh, it'll never happen in the UK.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:27):**  It's happening in the States.  It'll never happen here.  But you will.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:30):**  It'll be massive.  And that's...something like that will drive reusable econ packaging or reusable web retail  packaging.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:38):**  And I think you're seeing...you're already seeing that in the food space as well.  So you're seeing reusable formats sort of being played with.  I use a company called Splosh for all our detergents.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:50):**  So they send it through the post, it fits through the letterbox.  You buy one bottle.  You've got that for life.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:56):**  And all you do is drop in the concentrate into the bottle.  You biodegrade in the water.  And you've got your kitchen spray and your toilet cleaner, whatever.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:03):**  You've only ever used one bottle.  And what's the name of that brand again?  Splosh.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:06):**  Splosh.  Okay.  I shouldn't really be providing other companies.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:09):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But there is a great thing.  This is a great...the pioneering in...well, not only reusable solution, the bottle is  
**[0:34:12-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:12):**  reusable, but the actual product they're sending you is so much more sustainable because it's  coming through the post.  It's very small and light.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:15):**  And all you're doing is adding water to it, warm water.  And you've got your product right there.  And you're going to have to have a clean bottle.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:18):**  And you're going to have to have a clean bottle.  And you're going to have to have a clean bottle.  And you're going to have to have a clean bottle.

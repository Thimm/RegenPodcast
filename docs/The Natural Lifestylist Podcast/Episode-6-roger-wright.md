### The Natural Lifestylist Podcast  (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 19:33:59)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:00):**  Hi, I'm Tony Riddle and this is the Natural Lifestylist podcast.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:06):**  So way back in December I had this crazy idea to run from Land's End to John O'Groats in  
**[0:00:11-0:00:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:11):**  just 30 days.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:12):**  But I wasn't just going to run it, I was going to run it barefoot to raise funds for environmental  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:17):**  charities and collaborate with world leading experts to raise awareness and money for six  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:23):**  organisations fighting the top sustainability issues of our time.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:28):**  I knew running barefoot would raise many a socially extreme eyebrow and with that eyebrow  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:32):**  raising behaviour I would be able to provide a perfect platform to highlight the importance  
**[0:00:37-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:37):**  of connecting with our environment and those key sustainability issues of our time.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:45):**  So peeps, let me introduce you to the man that is Roger Wright.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:50):**  Roger Wright is a packaging technologist with over 20 years experience designing out waste  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:54):**  and designing in solutions that work.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:00:58):**  Roger is inspired by a future where the activity of packaging is understood more holistically  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:04):**  and can evolve within the context of an effective circular economy.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:08):**  He also believes that when packaging is integral to building a successful brand costing only  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:13):**  a tenth of the goods it protects and promotes but with a net positive impact on the world,  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:19):**  we should all love the last 10%.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:23):**  Roger and I spent a fair bit of time together and I feel I learnt so much from the conversation.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:27):**  And if the conversation wasn't enough to go by he also joined me for the final 10 mile  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:32):**  run of the day and an ice bath workshop with Arthur Paulings and Martin Batroux from the  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:38):**  Nice Collective.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:39):**  Anyway enough waffle, I hope you enjoy the sustainability chat.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:46):**  So I'm here with a man called Roger, Roger Wright.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:49):**  Good afternoon.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:50):**  Good afternoon Roger.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:51):**  You've heard me talk about in multiple podcasts now about Yehudi Gordon and Roger is the son  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:01:59):**  in law of Yehudi Gordon.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:00):**  Officially this year.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:01):**  There you go officially this year.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:02):**  We got married in March.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:03):**  Isn't that lovely.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:05):**  So Roger.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:06):**  No I didn't get married to Yehudi obviously.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:10):**  The way I said that was like I'm married to Titania of course.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:14):**  So Roger's here from M&S so we're going to be talking about, what are we going to talk  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:18):**  about Roger?  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:19):**  What are we on for?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:20):**  Well I want to just quickly say why am I here really?  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:22):**  Yeah why are you here?  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:23):**  Why am I here?  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:24):**  What are you doing behind the mic right now?  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:27):**  I'm the son in law of Yehudi, the great Yehudi Gordon.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:30):**  I think we can call him your student can we?  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:33):**  Of 79 years.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:34):**  I think we're both students.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:36):**  We're all students put it that way.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:37):**  I learned just as much from Yehudi as I think.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:39):**  So it was Yehudi who introduced me to you.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:42):**  And we did a little bit of work before and most significantly after I had a bad road  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:48):**  traffic accident.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:49):**  Right yeah.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:50):**  And you literally straightened me out and then more recently you taught me how to run.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:56):**  Let's cover this.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:57):**  Let's just go back to the car accident.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:02:59):**  What happened in the car accident?  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:00):**  Because that was quite a big thing talking about sustainability.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:03):**  It's about how do you get back from that.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:05):**  Yeah well I was crossing the Zebra crossing on the way to work on the way to the station  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:10):**  to go to work.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:11):**  It was a bit dusky.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:13):**  The car approached from the left.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:14):**  I thought it was slowing down.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:16):**  So I crossed and it turned out they were slowing down but not for me for the bend that came  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:21):**  afterwards.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:22):**  Wow.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:23):**  It took my legs from under me.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:24):**  I had no idea.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:25):**  I had no clear sign that was going to happen.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:27):**  So I went straight up in the air and I landed on my head like that.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:31):**  Literally took all my body weight on my head.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:34):**  I immediately stood up.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:35):**  It was in the shock of it all I think.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:38):**  It's amazing the adrenaline right.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:39):**  What else is broken?  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:40):**  You know I was trying to feel my body and thank God there was a passerby who happened  
**[0:03:45-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:45):**  to be a nurse.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:46):**  I said stop, sit down, you might have done something a lot worse than what was obviously  
**[0:03:51-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:51):**  happening in my head.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:53):**  And she looked after me until the ambulance came.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:55):**  And luckily of course I didn't have any severe injuries.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:03:59):**  I had a very nasty head injury.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:01):**  But that healed up.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:02):**  I've still got a nice scar on my head.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:05):**  But my back and my neck were scrunched up really badly after that.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:09):**  And when I first saw you obviously I was coming to see you because I was a cyclist at that  
**[0:04:15-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:15):**  point.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:17):**  Very hunched over.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:18):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:19):**  And I needed a better posture.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:20):**  But that accident made it 10 times worse.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:24):**  And you helped me a lot obviously.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:26):**  Straightened my back, showed me how to stand and how to walk and then I've also recently  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:31):**  had to run.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:32):**  So I've been doing a lot of running recently.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:34):**  Brilliant.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:35):**  And in the vivos of course.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:37):**  Yeah man.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:38):**  And that's part of the reason why I wanted to see you on this.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:40):**  Because we're going to get the run together aren't we?  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:41):**  I want to do a little bit of a run.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:42):**  That would be nice.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:43):**  But the other thing I noticed when you, well it occurred to me when you posted about this  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:48):**  adventure.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:49):**  I realised that when you were meeting all these people throughout the journey.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:56):**  Something that would be coming up a lot would be plastic waste.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:04:59):**  And in particular plastic packaging waste.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:02):**  Yeah like zero waste is a big topic for people right now.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:05):**  Talking to a lot of people, sustainability people who are quite rightly concerned about  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:08):**  it.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:09):**  So I thought, and I wonder if I can add anything to the conversation.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:12):**  Can I come and talk to you about trying to tell you what the industry is doing.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:17):**  Because some people may not realise there's a lot going on in the background.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:23):**  Maybe not as quickly as some people would like.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:25):**  Well it's an interesting one isn't it?  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:27):**  Because people expect things to change overnight.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:29):**  It's not, we don't have much patience here do we?  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:32):**  And it's the, and if it was to happen overnight, could you imagine the cost implications of  
**[0:05:37-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:37):**  that?  
**[0:05:38-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:38):**  And the next complaint would be, oh this is so expensive now.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:39):**  Why are we paying so much money?  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:40):**  So it has to be almost like drip fed in a way you know.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:44):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:45):**  And it's interesting because I was, people like me, packaging technologists who designed.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:49):**  I just got to start, I mean it's such a great title isn't it?  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:53):**  A packaging technologist, I love it.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:05:55):**  Well I started my career 25 years ago as a packaging designer.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:00):**  I would physically design the packaging, I wouldn't do the graphic design, I'd physically  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:03):**  do the structure of packaging.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:05):**  And then more recently in the last 10 years I've become a packaging technologist.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:09):**  Which is basically, you're not only looking at the structural design, you're looking at  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:12):**  the specification of the materials, how they're made, are they sustainably sourced?  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:18):**  You know, and all of the technical aspects as well as the design aspects.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:21):**  You know, and that's the job I've been doing for the last 10 years within a retailer, in  
**[0:06:25-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:25):**  a major retailer.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:26):**  I happen to be at M&S at the moment, I've been there eight years.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:29):**  So I've seen a lot of change over that time.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:32):**  So it's a 20 year period.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:34):**  25 year period.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:35):**  25 year period, but eight years with M&S.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:36):**  Eight years with M&S.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:37):**  But since day one I was trained as a designer to make the most of the materials given to  
**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:42):**  us.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:43):**  So it's in our packaging technologist and designers, just use the least amount of material  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:48):**  possible.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:49):**  So it's already in that DNA.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:50):**  It's already in our DNA.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:51):**  And until recently we were kind of, we were in the shadows of these big organizations.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:06:56):**  And then David Attenborough came along, Blue Planet 2, and suddenly, actually, you're the  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:01):**  guy, you can probably help us fix this and do something about it.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:05):**  And actually, people like me have been working on these ideas for 10, 15 years.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:09):**  And you're like behind the scenes, finally.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:11):**  Finally.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:12):**  And you can bring forward these ideas you've been working on that probably back and back  
**[0:07:17-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:17):**  many, many times.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:18):**  Because now it's so much more important.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:20):**  Not only from a, cynically it's from a PR perspective, and your reputation as a company  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:26):**  is a threat if you don't do something about it.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:29):**  But actually, a company like M&S just wants to do the right thing as well.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:33):**  And most of the retailers do as well, to be fair.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:37):**  The likes of me are now helping all these companies, big retailers and brands, do the  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:42):**  right thing when it comes to plastic packaging.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:44):**  And I guess, like I said, the other thing I want to get across to you today, and the  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:48):**  reason I'm here is I wanted to try and tell you about some of those things.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:53):**  Not because I'm not an advocate for the plastic industry, by far from it.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:07:57):**  But I think people need to understand that there are unintended consequences of potentially  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:02):**  switching out plastic into something else.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:04):**  It might not be the right thing to do.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:06):**  Okay, well it's good to have that conversation then, isn't it?  
**[0:08:09-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:10):**  Okay, man.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:11):**  Let's do it.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:12):**  Let's go there.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:13):**  So there's probably four things that we do as an industry, and specifically I do and  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:18):**  M&S do.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:20):**  And then we pass it to drill a bit deeper into that if you want to.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:23):**  Please, yeah.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:24):**  So the first thing we do, and as I say, it's in our DNA, we try and make, we try and just,  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:27):**  we try and remove plastic wherever we can.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:29):**  And we've been, obviously as I say, we do that anyway, but the Blue Planet effect has  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:34):**  put that on steroids in the last 18 months.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:36):**  So we desperately try and, we turn over every stone, look at every bit of packaging, say  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:40):**  what can we just take off?  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:41):**  Because fundamentally that's what we've got to do.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:42):**  We've got to just remove plastic.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:44):**  It's very difficult because we're potentially hamstrung by a long supply chain, brutal supply  
**[0:08:51-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:51):**  chain where products potentially get damaged or go off, get soiled or whatever.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:08:58):**  So we have to work within those constraints at the moment.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:03):**  And it's, you know, I'm a, we're trying to, as well as that, we're trying to just reduce  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:13):**  the amount of packaging as well.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:14):**  But actually that's not a sustainable, that's not sustainable in the long term.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:19):**  Because if a business grows and you've reduced, say, a certain amount of packaging on a certain  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:23):**  line, you're still going to produce more plastic going forward.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:27):**  So you're generating more plastic.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:28):**  You might have produced it by 10%, but if you're selling more stuff, you're creating  
**[0:09:32-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:32):**  more plastic.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:33):**  So we recognize that as in our industry.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:36):**  That's not the, it's the right thing to do, but it's not, it's the first step.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:40):**  So it's factoring in it with growth at the same time.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:43):**  So the second thing we obviously, the second thing we do, and I suppose this is more recent  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:46):**  really in our industry, is we're trying to redesign the way it works.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:50):**  We've got to sort of relearn plastics, rethink how we use it, and try and redesign if we  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:09:57):**  can, and that supply chain that I described as an Achilles heel for us.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:02):**  So completely reinvent almost for how we sell products.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:05):**  And that's quite difficult.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:08):**  You know, we've got some examples of that.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:10):**  The third thing we do, the third thing we are doing as an industry, all the retailers  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:14):**  have got together and all the brands, and we voluntarily have agreed through consultation  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:19):**  with the government to pay a lot more money for the collection and clean up plastic waste  
**[0:10:25-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:25):**  in the country.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:26):**  So we pay roughly about 10% of that at the moment as retailers.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:32):**  The new law which will come in, new laws which will come in over the next three years could  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:38):**  times that by 10.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:39):**  So typically a business, a big retailer is paying two to three million pounds for that  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:43):**  at the moment.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:44):**  That got to 20, 30, 40, and 40 million pounds that businesses will be asked to pay.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:49):**  Wow.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:50):**  And we're happy to do that.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:51):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:52):**  With one caveat.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:54):**  We want to see where that money goes.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:10:55):**  We want to see that money going into new infrastructure for recycling or for –  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:00):**  Where the resources are.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:02):**  We want to physically see the – we want to see what that money is spent on.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:05):**  For example, if compostable packaging becomes a thing, we want an infrastructure for compostable  
**[0:11:11-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:11):**  packaging.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:12):**  Yeah, like we were having that discussion earlier.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:13):**  I didn't realize that.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:14):**  It doesn't exist at the moment.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:16):**  So basically what we were discussing earlier is that, you know, plastic bags – who is  
**[0:11:19-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:19):**  it, Bart?  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:20):**  Who is it at the moment?  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:21):**  Co-ops.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:22):**  Co-ops.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:23):**  They've introduced compostable bags, which are great.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:25):**  But if the refuse company turn up and arrive and they see it, then they may be pulling  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:29):**  those out.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:30):**  Correct.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:31):**  But if they're left within the compost, then they're compostable.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:33):**  But if they're pulled out, then they're not.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:35):**  So until everybody switches to compostable bags, that model still isn't trusted, right?  
**[0:11:42-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:42):**  Correct.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:44):**  And what the co-ops have done is great, actually, because they're slowly introducing that  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:47):**  bag into parts of the UK that does have food waste collection.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:51):**  Only 60 percent of the UK has food waste collections, and only about half of those trust the bags  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:57):**  that they're getting in that waste.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:11:59):**  So the co-op are doing a managed approach to that, but they're also lobbying government  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:04):**  to say, come on, guys, let's have a compostable system that works, because there's nothing  
**[0:12:08-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:08):**  at the moment.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:09):**  Yeah, because it's like going back to the first conversation we had in the podcast we  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:12):**  had, which is with Hugo Tagholm.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:14):**  So they were one of the big voices in amongst that, that they were getting the surcharge  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:18):**  onto plastic bags, the 5P charge put onto plastic bags.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:22):**  And that's a matter of changing legislation again, because otherwise people would just  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:25):**  be going in and grabbing plastic bags anyway.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:28):**  And firstly, you know, to the cynic, it was like, oh, people are just going to pay five  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:32):**  pence, but no, it made an 85 percent reduction difference.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:36):**  So it has to change.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:37):**  Again, it has to be the bigger picture, it needs to change at that government level.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:40):**  Isn't it?  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:41):**  Well, at least the fourth thing I think that we tried to do as a company, that's change  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:45):**  behaviours.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:46):**  This is the hardest of the four things, is to change behaviours.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:49):**  What's normalised?  
**[0:12:50-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:50):**  Yeah, and bags is a good example where M&S actually introduced a charge for bags before  
**[0:12:56-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:56):**  it was law.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:12:57):**  So probably at the same time that Service Against Sewage are doing their thing.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:00):**  Oh, so you were already charging before the law changed.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:02):**  We introduced, we had a charge.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:03):**  Oh, wow, brilliant.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:04):**  We saw a reduction in bag use.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:05):**  There you go.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:07):**  And then because of who we are, people tend to sort of watch M&S and they tend to follow,  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:12):**  but obviously the law had to change for everybody to do it.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:16):**  But there's still more we can do.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:19):**  So can I ask what M&S, what were they doing?  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:22):**  So if you introduced a charge of five p, say, per bag, where would the five, so talk about  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:28):**  traceability, where does the five p go?  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:30):**  We used, we put that into different charities at the time.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:33):**  And now that's mandated in law as well, so you've got to pay a certain amount to a charity.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:38):**  So we did that and we continue to do that for our food bags that we still sell.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:44):**  Brilliant.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:45):**  But we've just, just last week actually, we've opened a new store in Clapham Common.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:50):**  I think it's Clapham or maybe near the station.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:52):**  Okay.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:53):**  Brand new store, completely plastic free of bags, no bags.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:57):**  Wow.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:13:58):**  And something else that was interesting, we actually introduced a water tap.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:01):**  It's not revolutionary, is it?  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:03):**  We've introduced a water tap so people can go refill their bottles.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:06):**  Hopefully we can change, we can sort of change behaviors.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:08):**  What a shift though, because it's all happening, isn't it?  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:11):**  It's like, it's only one store.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:13):**  Isn't that, but that's, I mean, surely that should be already, that should be on the news  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:17):**  or it should be on some kind of advertisement already because that's, that's how you bring  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:22):**  around, that's being the change.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:24):**  And then others will have to align with that, won't they?  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:26):**  Because we start to get into that competitive corporate kind of model eventually, don't  
**[0:14:30-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:30):**  we?  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:31):**  You know, there is a, there is a, there is a thing though out there that companies, big  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:34):**  companies are scared of talking too much about their, their green initiatives.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:39):**  I saw a piece about this.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:40):**  For fear of being called green washers.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:42):**  Yep.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:43):**  They're worried that they'll be client, they'll be green washing the, you know, their customers.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:48):**  I think they're all, yeah, I think I read something about, they're also concerned that,  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:51):**  you know, some of them are doing amazing work.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:53):**  I mean, absolutely phenomenal work, but it isn't 100% traceable.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:14:59):**  So their concern is we put ourselves out there as this sustainable environmental brand.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:05):**  Then someone's going to be able to pick on something, you know, and it's a bit like the  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:08):**  individual, isn't it?  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:09):**  You know, because there is that, that can happen.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:14):**  You know?  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:15):**  So we've got to, we've got to try and change behaviors and there's, there's, you know,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:17):**  there's a number of ways we can do it.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:19):**  So we've done it on bags, trying to do it with water if we can, you know, get people  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:23):**  to, you don't need to buy, you don't need to sell water.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:25):**  In the future, who is going to buy a bottle of water in a supermarket?  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:27):**  I'm not sure that's, that will be a thing.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:30):**  But the convenience of the product and the packaging is so good.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:36):**  Customers aren't easily going to change what they do.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:39):**  And that's part of the problem in a way.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:41):**  Yeah, I think, again, going back to Hugo's conversations, because they're bringing in,  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:45):**  you know, they're fighting for legislation at the moment around bottle banks, right,  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:50):**  plastic bottle banks.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:51):**  And then at least you know that that plastic bottle bank, the plastics can be recycled  
**[0:15:56-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:56):**  and upcycled, let's say.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:15:59):**  Part of that, you know, that 40 million potentially that we pay as a retailer more, part of that  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:07):**  will be, we'll go into the DRS system.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:09):**  The DRS system is being launched in Scotland now.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:12):**  Okay.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:13):**  The Deposit Return Scheme.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:14):**  Yep.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:15):**  A lot of acronyms in retail, I'm really sorry.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:18):**  No, it's good.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:19):**  DRS.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:20):**  The DRS.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:21):**  The Deposit Return Scheme.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:22):**  Deposit Return Scheme.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:23):**  It's an old fashioned idea, right?  
**[0:16:24-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:25):**  Take your bottle back, get your 10p or whatever.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:26):**  I remember taking bottles of pop back to the newsagent.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:31):**  But that is, that is, that's, customers got to think, ah, I've got to be bothered to take  
**[0:16:35-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:35):**  it back.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:36):**  But this could change behaviors, but not just on bottles.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:38):**  It could potentially become more ingrained in terms of what sort of other, what other  
**[0:16:43-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:43):**  things could we take back.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:45):**  Could we be renting our packaging in the future?  
**[0:16:48-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:48):**  All of it, potentially.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:50):**  Wow, because we, because we have deliveries from Riverford, right?  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:54):**  And Riverford, they come in cardboard boxes every week.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:56):**  And we put the cardboard boxes back out.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:16:58):**  They take the cardboard boxes away and upturn the new, the new boxes.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:02):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:03):**  Which again is a great, I think a great system, great model.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:05):**  And if I'm right, Riverford also, I suppose this goes to the wider point, Riverford only  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:09):**  sell you seasonal fruit and veg.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:12):**  Is that right?  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:13):**  Well, some of it, you know, they can do, but I think in the UK, we'd suffer a bit.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:16):**  You know, people would just get sick of eating Brassica Group.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:20):**  Because I think some of it does, he does ship it in France, Spain.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:27):**  But I think there's a, there's a, again, he's the ethical part of that.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:31):**  That's, that's the standard, I think.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:33):**  Because I think a bigger conversation we have to have as an industry and with the customers  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:37):**  is the carbon footprint of what we're doing is counterintuitive to some of the things  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:42):**  that you think are bad.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:45):**  The carbon footprint of a plastic bag is so much lower than a paper bag.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:48):**  It's not even funny.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:50):**  It's tiny compared to a paper bag.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:53):**  And yet, you feel like that paper bag is the right solution.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:17:56):**  But actually, when you look into it, let's reinvent what we're doing over plastic.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:01):**  Let's try and remove bags altogether or do something completely different rather than  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:04):**  introduce something that could be worse for the environment.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:07):**  Yeah, I wonder what's the carbon imprint of the compostable bag then?  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:12):**  How does that work?  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:13):**  They're pretty high.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:14):**  So if a plastic bag is one on the scale, a compostable bag is probably a three or a four.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:20):**  And then a paper bag is probably a nine or a 10, looking at the carbon impact.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:24):**  I mean, it depends what you do with it, of course, but that's roughly where it sits.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:28):**  So you can imagine on a bigger scale, the impact, if suddenly a big supermarket changes  
**[0:18:34-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:34):**  to paper bags overnight.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:35):**  Yeah, and it suddenly gets to a confusing conversation, that, doesn't it?  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:38):**  Because plastic bags are going to be around forever, of course, aren't they?  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:41):**  You know, compostable, I guess, would be the answer then.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:44):**  If it's a three on the scale.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:47):**  And then can we offset that?  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:49):**  You know, so another guy, I want to introduce you to Michael, actually.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:52):**  I interviewed Michael Thornton the other day.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:53):**  He's the CEO of Carbon Analytics.  
**[0:18:57-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:57):**  Did he used to work for DS Smith?  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:18:58):**  I recognize that name.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:01):**  I think, well, I used to work for a company called DS Smith, and I think Mike...  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:04):**  Maybe.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:05):**  Maybe.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:06):**  Years ago.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:07):**  Brilliant brain again.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:09):**  I mean, for all businesses, even down to the coffee shop now.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:13):**  They're, you know, it's a big, big companies down to the coffee shop.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:17):**  And so that you could go in and you could look at, let's say, it was a sandwich, for  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:21):**  instance.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:22):**  That sandwich, they can tell you what the carbon print is of that sandwich versus another  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:27):**  sandwich versus something else, which is going to be incredible when it moves in that direction.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:31):**  Of course, of course.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:32):**  So then that comes down to the individual then making that decision too, which would  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:35):**  then drive, oh, this is what we want to be selling based on, yeah, people's preference.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:42):**  Yeah, getting into human behavior again, aren't you?  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:44):**  I mean, I'd love to say to all our customers, go vegan.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:48):**  That's going to save the planet.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:49):**  That's going to reduce our carbon footprint and massively.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:52):**  But nine people are going to tell me to go away.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:55):**  One person might give it a try.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:19:57):**  You've got to make that decision for yourself to change the world, if you like.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:02):**  Yeah, yeah, of course.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:03):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:04):**  So I went meat-free and milk-free this year.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:07):**  Brilliant.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:08):**  So I stopped, I've just stopped, and I'm loving it.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:10):**  It's brilliant.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:11):**  And that's even, I mean, that's a huge conversation itself because I had a, I did an interview  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:15):**  with someone that's the ethical butcher, and we talked about holistic management.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:20):**  So holistic management, if you imagine you had like the grazing animal, and originally  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:25):**  you would have had an apex predator that would move the animals around, right?  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:29):**  So they, if you had a field this big, they would get the grazing animals and they act  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:34):**  like the apex predator and they move the animals into the, into this segment, let's say, right?  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:41):**  Into, say, a 20th of this square.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:45):**  And then the animals are then just, they're grazing, grazing, graze, poop, mash it all  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:50):**  in, and that sequesters carbon.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:52):**  So there's this, there's a conversation that hasn't quite come through yet.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:57):**  There's more to it.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:20:58):**  There's a bigger picture there, what I'm discovering more and more with that holistic management.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:01):**  It sounds very interesting.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:03):**  And then you can move them onto land that's basically, it's not being used.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:07):**  And then we can start to change, change the landscape again.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:10):**  That's the thing about compostable and biodegradable plastics.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:13):**  If you don't do that, you're sequestering the carbon for as long as you can keep that  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:18):**  material in the system.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:19):**  So if you can reuse and recycle plastic over and over again, that's locked up there.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:25):**  As soon as you put it in a compost heap, that carbon is into the atmosphere.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:29):**  And that's one of the disadvantages, one of the few disadvantages of a biodegradable or  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:34):**  a compostable piece of packaging.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:37):**  Ideally, we want to keep that in the system.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:39):**  That's kind of the recycling is way down the hierarchy.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:42):**  And so is compostable, really, you really want to keep that material in the system if  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:46):**  you can.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:47):**  So we do a lot, we did a lot of work to try and put recycled material into our products  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:51):**  where you can.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:52):**  And customers are coming around to that as well.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:55):**  For example, we've removed the black food trays.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:21:59):**  I'm sure you don't eat microwave meals, but a lot of people do.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:04):**  And those historically would have been black.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:06):**  And they're very difficult to recycle.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:07):**  Not impossible, but very difficult.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:09):**  So now most retailers now come out of that black.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:13):**  Waitros, to their credit, have now said to customers actually, it might be pink this  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:18):**  tomorrow, it might be yellow the day after, it might be a different color, basically,  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:21):**  because we don't know necessarily what recycler is coming into the system.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:24):**  Oh, wow.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:25):**  We take whatever we can get, and you get a food trade safe, it's clean, but it might  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:30):**  be a different color tomorrow.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:31):**  Don't worry about it.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:32):**  You go back five years, maybe even two years, marketeers are going, that's no way, I want  
**[0:22:39-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:39):**  my black tray and I don't want it to change color ever.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:41):**  So now the customers are coming around to the idea that things, recycled material is  
**[0:22:45-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:45):**  a good thing, and it is still a safe thing to have your food.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:48):**  And as you say, it stays in the system.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:50):**  Exactly, yeah.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:51):**  So we're working hard to make sure we put recycled material into packaging.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:22:56):**  And one very exciting bit of technology that isn't ours but we're using is a system whereby  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:02):**  any of the nearly nasty, horrible, unrecyclable plastic can now be turned back into what is  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:08):**  called plaques, basically a waxy oil, which is basically you turn that back into plastic  
**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:14):**  again.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:15):**  So this technology exists.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:18):**  I think one of the local authorities in Scotland has now got one of these machines.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:22):**  And the way that it's been designed, it's modular, so you can just be bolted onto any  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:25):**  existing material recycling facility.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:28):**  It's relatively inexpensive and it cracks the plastic down to almost its constitute  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:33):**  parts into oil and then potentially you can use that again either as fuel or as oil to  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:38):**  make something else.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:39):**  This is quite new.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:40):**  So we've launched the take-back scheme in eight stores where people can bring all that  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:45):**  nasty plastic back that historically was really impossible to recycle.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:49):**  And we're sending it to this plant to turn it into oil.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:52):**  Before we do that, we're going to turn it into playground equipment first.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:55):**  We're going to use the first batch for that.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:57):**  And then hopefully we'll roll this out next year.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:23:58):**  So that's like introducing a DRS?  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:00):**  Well, I suppose it's a stage before the DRS.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:04):**  It's free for the customer.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:05):**  If they want to bring it back, and this is where the behaviors comes in, I want to persuade  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:09):**  all our customers to bring all of their plastics back.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:12):**  Yeah, because they're almost needing incentives sometimes.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:14):**  As it goes into the black bin.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:16):**  So now I'm telling everyone I can listen.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:20):**  Once a week, put all your nasty plastic in a carrier bag, tie it up, bring it in and  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:24):**  put it in the take-back box at the store.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:27):**  And all of that gets genuinely recycled.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:31):**  It's not getting shipped to China.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:32):**  It's not getting burnt or landfilled.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:33):**  It's actually getting recycled into something that could potentially be remade into another  
**[0:24:34-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:34):**  plastic.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:35):**  Wow.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:36):**  So this is exciting.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:37):**  And over and over and over again.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:38):**  So there's loads and loads of innovation out there.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:39):**  And if nothing else, you know, Attenborough and all the wave of, quite rightly, the criticism  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:51):**  about ocean waste is pushing innovation now really, really strongly.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:54):**  So people like me can actually go, brilliant, we can put some of these ideas back into the  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:24:59):**  market.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:00):**  It's amazing that just it's so reactive, isn't it?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:06):**  It is reactive.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:07):**  And then people like yourself that have been proactive for a certain amount of time, then  
**[0:25:10-0:25:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:10):**  it's like, wow, I can find it finally where it's happening.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:13):**  But I suppose you just take a, I take a step back and go, okay, fair enough.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:18):**  I don't, I'm not a, I'm not a, I told you so type of person.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:21):**  Okay, that's, that's being patient in the process.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:24):**  Let's revisit these ideas.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:27):**  Something I did probably six years ago is I grew packaging out of mushrooms.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:33):**  So we did a trial that we can actually grow packaging in a dark space.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:38):**  And the mycelium starts to react, but you've put it in a mold, you can mold it into different  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:43):**  shapes.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:44):**  So we did, we actually did it and we can use it as protective packaging.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:47):**  You get a, I don't know, a washing machine or a big heavy item in a box that needs protection.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:53):**  Yes.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:54):**  Rather than having that horrible polystyrene around them and the plastic packaging.  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:25:58):**  So we, you know, we were doing things like that years ago and now I'm reintroducing that  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:02):**  potentially into, into our world.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:04):**  Wow, man.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:05):**  It's just one of them.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:06):**  It's one of a hundred and, you know, hundreds of different innovations that we can now revisit,  
**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:10):**  you know.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:11):**  So I, you know, I wanted, you know, I wanted to get across that there was a lot going on  
**[0:26:14-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:14):**  out there.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:15):**  There's a lot of positive stuff behind the scenes, isn't there?  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:18):**  You know, and I think for anyone listening is just, you know, again, it's being patient  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:22):**  within the process and understand that, yeah.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:25):**  But what you're, what you're, what you're doing and what's happening out there with  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:28):**  surface against sewage and everybody else is brilliant because it just, it makes people  
**[0:26:32-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:32):**  stop and think, should I reuse that bag?  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:35):**  Should I use it, you know, buy a reusable bottle instead of, you know, keep buying a  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:39):**  bottle of water.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:41):**  And at the same time, just be patient with yourself and remove anxiety.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:44):**  I was saying earlier, you know, there's been occasions when we've needed plastic bottles  
**[0:26:47-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:47):**  on this run.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:48):**  It's just, there hasn't been an alternative.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:51):**  And I could, I could easily go into, oh my God, I've got to do this.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:55):**  But, you know, be patient with the process and just give yourself a break a bit, you  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:26:59):**  know.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:01):**  And I think until, as we said, the bigger players and legislations change and things  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:05):**  are just normalized, then that, that, that voice will quieten anyway.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:13):**  With everything else that's going on in the country, this is, this stuff will happen.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:16):**  The new taxes will come in, retailers will start to pay a bit more.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:20):**  Hopefully we'll see the infrastructure develop.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:22):**  So one thing the government has promised to do is to mandate food collection, food waste  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:26):**  collection across the UK, well across England, but it should, it should follow throughout  
**[0:27:31-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:31):**  the UK.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:32):**  Okay.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:33):**  Which means then you could potentially build behind that, you can build a, an infrastructure  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:37):**  for compostable biodegradable packaging, potentially if you could put it in the food waste.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:43):**  So then you can tell everybody or you could potentially have everybody using the same  
**[0:27:46-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:46):**  kind of packaging and all going into the right, to the right place.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:49):**  Wow.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:50):**  You just don't want to make it too complicated for customers.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:51):**  I mean, I see, you see those, you see those bins sometimes where there's probably five,  
**[0:27:56-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:56):**  five different holes and you've got to think, oh, which, which hole.  
**[0:27:58-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:58):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:27:59):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:00):**  We need to simplify that.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:01):**  They just want one bin for the recycler and it gets dealt with and it gets dealt with  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:05):**  properly.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:06):**  You know, ideally we don't want to put it in there in the first place, but what's left  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:10):**  over, we can physically recycle.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:12):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:14):**  I work a lot on in, in.com, e-com.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:18):**  And any business will tell you that's, that's where the growth is.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:20):**  The only, it's the only way, it's the only place the growth is.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:23):**  So a lot of the nightmares you see is e-com packaging, big boxes for the fresh air, you  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:28):**  know, and a lot of waste appear, a lot of waste there, but that is something that we're  
**[0:28:33-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:33):**  working on too.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:34):**  So we're looking at trying to improve all of that.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:36):**  Yeah, I appreciate that.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:37):**  You know, James here, we had a issue with James's bag and lost the drone and the laptop  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:42):**  and cameras and new stuff's been delivered.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:45):**  And just watching just the, just the amount of packaging that comes through.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:50):**  We order it on Amazon, it arrives.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:53):**  Really, is this, is this necessary?  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:28:54):**  Well, interesting, Amazon have just, just about to make it policy fit for them.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:00):**  And obviously everyone who wants to sell stuff has to use Amazon now.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:03):**  They've made it policy and it's a brilliant idea.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:06):**  They've basically said to the likes of, you know, a drone maker.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:11):**  So what it used to do, your packaging used to come to us, we'd over wrap it and send  
**[0:29:14-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:14):**  it to a customer.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:16):**  Actually what you've got to do now is make that packaging fit for the whole journey.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:20):**  We mandate that.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:21):**  If you want to work with us, you've got to make that packaging right for the whole journey.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:24):**  Wow.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:25):**  All Amazon really do now is just light touch, pass it onto the customer.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:29):**  So there's no extra packaging going on that drone box, for example.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:33):**  So from a certain weight and size of product from the first of October, I think, it's mandated.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:38):**  If you want to work with Amazon, you have to follow this process.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:41):**  They call it frustration free packaging.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:43):**  Frustration free.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:44):**  Nice name.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:45):**  It's nice.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:46):**  But it's a brilliant idea.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:47):**  FFP.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:48):**  You know, whatever you think of Amazon, that's an actually brilliant, that's a brilliant  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:52):**  idea because it just makes people think about the end to end piece of packaging rather than  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:29:57):**  just adding packaging throughout their supply chain.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:00):**  So I can see that.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:01):**  I can see other big online companies following that.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:04):**  Have MNS got anything in place where you can look at full traceability?  
**[0:30:07-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:07):**  Is there anything coming in there?  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:09):**  In terms of packaging?  
**[0:30:10-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:10):**  Yeah, I mean, we're already fully traceable.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:12):**  So we know exactly where we know.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:14):**  I mean, we produce a hell of a lot of paper packaging.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:18):**  And we do something called the wood report every year.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:20):**  So we actually trace all of the paper, obviously comes from wood back to almost the forest.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:27):**  And in terms of plastic, we've got to, we fully trace it back to the producer of the  
**[0:30:31-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:31):**  plastic as well.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:32):**  And so for the customer, they can find that anywhere?  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:34):**  Well, they can if they choose to ask.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:38):**  Okay.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:39):**  So we don't publish that information on the website.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:42):**  What we do do, we have a map of our vendors, our product vendors.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:45):**  So you can see where all your products coming from.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:48):**  And then obviously behind the scenes, we've got all that due diligence on the packaging  
**[0:30:52-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:52):**  as well.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:53):**  I think it's well worth doing because I did a workshop with Lululemon.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:30:57):**  And Lululemon, they invited me in and I went in there, personal shopper, this lady take  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:05):**  me round.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:06):**  And she just, I think these will be great for you.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:08):**  And then they gave me a cup of tea and then out I went.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:11):**  Anyway, posted about it because it was a nice experience.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:14):**  And I'm doing a workshop with them and I got some clothes out of it.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:18):**  And then someone posted in immediately, immediately about sustainability and Lululemon.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:25):**  And I was like, right, okay, let's have a look.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:27):**  So when you go on, again, they go all the way through it.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:30):**  So we're trying to be as transparent as possible.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:33):**  Here's we did a full carbon report in whichever year.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:37):**  And it's all there.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:38):**  If you look, you can find it.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:40):**  And I thought that was brilliant because it was actually an opportunity to say, well,  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:43):**  again, you can't expect a company to change overnight.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:46):**  It's a massive organization.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:48):**  But these are the things they're doing.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:49):**  And this is the direction they're heading in, you know.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:51):**  And we can see that.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:53):**  Reporting of what we do is really important to us.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:31:56):**  And we're not perfect, but we're working hard to improve that, you know, the transparency.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:03):**  So yeah, we've got that.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:04):**  We've got information.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:05):**  Anyone wishes to find it, you know, wishes to have it.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:08):**  Sounds like you're doing amazing work.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:09):**  There's stuff there on there.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:10):**  You know, it's stuff we've discussed already on those, it's closing me away because it's...  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:14):**  I mean, no two days are the same when you work in packaging.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:16):**  If you're touching every part of the business, you know, everybody needs packaging.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:21):**  Everybody somewhere needs somehow to get something from A to B, from B to C, you know, and you're  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:27):**  the people that facilitate that.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:29):**  It's a fun industry.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:31):**  And it's even more interesting at the moment with everything that's going on.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:34):**  So I say bring it on.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:36):**  Anyone who's got issues with plastic, bring it on.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:38):**  We're happy to help.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:39):**  Okay.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:40):**  What do you see the progression over the next, let's say, five years?  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:44):**  What's the over the next...what's coming over the next five years from a packaging technologist  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:49):**  prediction?  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:52):**  From a sort of meta level, I think reusable packaging is going to be more and more prevalent  
**[0:32:57-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:57):**  in our world.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:32:58):**  I mean, one thing I...obviously, we have a big fashion business.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:03):**  And the next thing I think from a fashion point of view is rental clothes.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:07):**  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:08):**  Jasmine was talking about this.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:09):**  With rental clothes, you're going to have reusable bags.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:14):**  You're going to have to have products going backwards and forwards constantly.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:17):**  You can't have single-use plastic on those products.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:20):**  If you become a rental business, you've got to have a reusable system.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:23):**  And I think people go, oh, it'll never happen in the UK.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:27):**  It's happening in the States.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:28):**  It'll never happen here.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:29):**  But you will.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:30):**  It'll be massive.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:31):**  And that's...something like that will drive reusable econ packaging or reusable web retail  
**[0:33:37-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:37):**  packaging.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:38):**  And I think you're seeing...you're already seeing that in the food space as well.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:41):**  So you're seeing reusable formats sort of being played with.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:46):**  I use a company called Splosh for all our detergents.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:50):**  So they send it through the post, it fits through the letterbox.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:54):**  You buy one bottle.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:55):**  You've got that for life.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:33:56):**  And all you do is drop in the concentrate into the bottle.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:01):**  You biodegrade in the water.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:02):**  And you've got your kitchen spray and your toilet cleaner, whatever.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:03):**  You've only ever used one bottle.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:04):**  And what's the name of that brand again?  
**[0:34:05-0:34:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:05):**  Splosh.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:06):**  Splosh.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:07):**  Okay.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:08):**  I shouldn't really be providing other companies.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:09):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:10):**  But there is a great thing.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:11):**  This is a great...the pioneering in...well, not only reusable solution, the bottle is  
**[0:34:12-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:12):**  reusable, but the actual product they're sending you is so much more sustainable because it's  
**[0:34:13-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:13):**  coming through the post.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:14):**  It's very small and light.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:15):**  And all you're doing is adding water to it, warm water.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:16):**  And you've got your product right there.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:17):**  And you're going to have to have a clean bottle.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-6-Roger-Wright-e5ig3d#t=0:34:18):**  And you're going to have to have a clean bottle.

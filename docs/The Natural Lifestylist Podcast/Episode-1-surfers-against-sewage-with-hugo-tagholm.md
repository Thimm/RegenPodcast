**[0:00:29-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:00:29):**  So with that socially extreme eyebrow, it created a platform, gave me an opportunity  
**[0:00:35-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:00:35):**  to raise awareness and funds for environmental charities and collaborate with leading experts

**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:00:54):**  I'd be able to provide a platform, a perfect platform to highlight the importance of connecting  
**[0:00:59-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:00:59):**  with our environment and those all important key sustainability issues of our time.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:01:07):**  So I had the pleasure of visiting Surfers Against Sewage and getting behind the mic  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:01:11):**  with Hugo Tagholm.

**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:01:26):**  and are becoming a leading voice to help shift legislation.

**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:02:02):**  about sustainability and the great work they're doing because I'm not the expert here.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:02:06):**  I might be an expert barefoot running but I'm certainly not an expert with sustainability.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:02:10):**  I'm growing.

**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:02:23):**  Things have really changed for us and there's so much highlighted for us at this stage.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:02:28):**  How long have you been here now?

**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:02:37):**  really stoked to have you come by and to be part of your epic journey.

**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:02:45):**  You're a much braver man than I am and probably fitter no doubt too.  
**[0:02:51-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:02:51):**  SS has been going almost 30 years now and I first fell in love with the organization  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:03:00):**  back in 1991, the year after it was founded as a young surfer and environmentalist.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:03:07):**  I've always been passionate about the environment and nature generally.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:03:12):**  I saw this rebellious, slightly anti-establishment, punky organization that really appealed to  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:03:21):**  me.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:03:22):**  Big issue back then was sewage, hence the name.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:03:26):**  That's when I first got involved at a little surf competition up the coast from here in  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:03:29):**  Polsette.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:03:30):**  I met some of the founders and my journey began then.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:03:34):**  Of course, I went off to university.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:03:36):**  I went to do what I did in London in my career and stuff.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:03:41):**  Then 10 years ago, over 10 years now, just over 10 years, 2008, I took the helm.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:03:48):**  The organization at that stage had gone through a heyday.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:03:51):**  It had some brilliant people involved, some amazing campaigners, some brilliant leaders  
**[0:03:56-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:03:56):**  and achieved a lot.  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:03:57):**  It lost its way.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:03:58):**  It wasn't quite sure what it wanted to do.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:04:01):**  The initial campaign had been very successful and it needed to develop and expand and change.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:04:08):**  That's what I came in to do.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:04:10):**  I came in and this whole place, this office was a bit of a squat.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:04:14):**  It was a bit-

**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:04:16):**  You were somewhere else before?  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:04:17):**  It was in another office around the corner in the early days and a couple of spaces before  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:04:22):**  that but this has been the longest home of SAS.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:04:25):**  This is the spiritual homeland of it.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:04:27):**  St. Allen, St. Agnes, these beaches are the homeland, the place where it was born.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:04:35):**  I took over and it was a physical and metaphorical squat.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:04:38):**  It was a crazy ramshackle place, Weal Kitty, where we are now.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:04:43):**  There weren't many people about.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:04:45):**  I had come from working in central London and came in here and it was in a really bad

**[0:05:10-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:05:10):**  Yeah.

**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:05:13):**  The team came out to meet me.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:05:16):**  You realize that it's such a big impact you're making at the moment.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:05:20):**  It's a small organization.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:05:21):**  It's such a great message in itself, isn't it?  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:05:25):**  I think, yeah, there's a message on that.

**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:05:32):**  on people at times.

**[0:05:39-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:05:39):**  I think the age of the really giant charities when it becomes really a big marketing and

**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:05:50):**  I think we're a really accessible charity.

**[0:07:45-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:07:45):**  1990, May, 1990, May the 10th, 1990.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:07:47):**  I mean, that's because that's incredible.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:07:49):**  I was explaining to the guys downstairs that I pretty much came, I'd say from, I'd say

**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:08:11):**  board, you know?

**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:08:16):**  You know, and I, you know, I, you know, I surfed in the area, you know, during those  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:08:21):**  times and, you know, sometimes I saw pollution, sometimes I didn't.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:08:25):**  You know, we've still got water quality issues now.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:08:28):**  We've just had damming report from the EA about the performance of water companies.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:08:34):**  So we've had a lot of success.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:08:36):**  We've seen a great cleanup of our coastline, but we're almost, we've peaked past the top  
**[0:08:41-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:08:41):**  of the bell curve now and slipping back down.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:08:43):**  Oh really?

**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:08:45):**  So you can't afford to drop the ball there.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:08:46):**  It's not staying on it.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:08:47):**  More sewage, you know, getting back into the sea.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:08:49):**  And also that creates the perfect storm with more people in the sea now.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:08:53):**  So back in 1990 when we started, surfing truly still was a niche sport.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:08:58):**  It was far out.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:09:00):**  It was for a few hardy individuals.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:09:01):**  Razz man.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:09:02):**  You know, maybe, maybe in two weeks in the summer, you know, kids would come down and  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:09:06):**  get a polystyrene board and it was really like a subculture.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:09:09):**  You know, now it's not a subculture.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:09:10):**  We've got, you know, the high street using surfing all the time to sell more products.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:09:14):**  We've got more and more people surfing year round.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:09:17):**  Amazing wetsuits means they can surf equally as well in January as in June.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:09:21):**  So the whole thing has exploded.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:09:24):**  And in a way that explosion in the actual market and the, you know, the sport of surfing  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:09:29):**  means that more people are now putting themselves in the firing line of potential pollution,  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:09:33):**  whether that's, you know, toxic chemicals in the sea, sewage in the sea, plastic pollution  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:09:37):**  on our tide lines, which is everywhere.

**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:11:37):**  and we do beach meets and stuff like that.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:11:40):**  We get them out in the sea.

**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:11:45):**  isn't there?

**[0:11:49-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:11:49):**  I mean, they're all looking out of the sea.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:11:51):**  Absolutely.

**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:11:57):**  the most authentic voice of the, the ocean in the sort of charity sector, you know, really  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:12:02):**  represent people who live and breathe the ocean really want to, you know, get involved

**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:12:09):**  You know, we're, as you say, we're sort of small team here, but we empower a lot of people  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:12:12):**  and I think that model is attractive to the policy makers, to business leaders because  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:12:17):**  authenticity is a really, really important part of our narrative and creating change.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:12:23):**  I think in this world that is full of fakes, I think SAS can stand up as a really authentic  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:12:27):**  charity that truly is connected to the ocean.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:12:30):**  And we look at the ocean out of those windows over there in the office and that, and that,  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:12:35):**  that is a really big point of difference to other charities that might lose that really  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:12:39):**  tactile direct connection with this thing that they're trying to protect or the issues  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:12:43):**  they're working on.

**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:12:49):**  it being it, you know?

**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:12:54):**  It's an obvious one, isn't it?  
**[0:12:55-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:12:55):**  Yeah, so we go from sewerage to now marine conservation, looking at plastics.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:02):**  Well plastics is the zytlyce.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:03):**  I mean it's huge right now, right?  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:06):**  It's the zytlyce.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:07):**  And you know, we've got this, you know, we, we, you know, back in sort of 2016 we realized,  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:12):**  you know, that, you know, whilst we've been working on plastics, um, you know, plastic  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:16):**  pollution for a long while, in some ways we haven't really named, you know, named it.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:21):**  We hadn't really, you know, formed the cohesive campaign around it.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:24):**  And so we launched our plastic free communities campaign.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:27):**  We started much more active campaigning on pushing for legislation around plastic bags,  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:32):**  around plastic bottles, around all of those things to create, you know, as it were, you  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:37):**  know, not taxes, charges and, um, and, uh, better ways to create a circular economy.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:43):**  And also looking, looking at bands, so bands on straws and stirrers and those sorts of  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:46):**  things.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:47):**  And, um,  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:48):**  So you were behind the legislation that led to the charges on plastic bags?  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:55):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:57):**  So we were one of the charities that formed the coalition.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:13:58):**  Um, you know, we worked with four or five big charities on that.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:02):**  Um, and of course, you know, everyone at the time thought, you know, five pence, what,  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:05):**  you know, what's that going to do to the plastic bag circulation?  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:08):**  But indeed it reduced it by over 80%, um, billions fewer bags in the environment.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:13):**  That's so good to hear, man.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:14):**  Cause I was one of those voices.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:16):**  Um, you know, where's, where's that five P go?  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:19):**  What impact is going to have?  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:21):**  People are still going to do the same thing.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:22):**  And I think as, as that small change over time though, and because we've become more  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:28):**  aware of plastic, I guess that's just going to grow and grow and grow more, isn't it?  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:34):**  Because we never take plastic bag shopping and it's just not, you know, it started off,  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:38):**  we used to take the plastic bags we had to go shopping.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:42):**  Now it's like, okay, we have cloth bags that we take, you know?  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:45):**  Well, it's sort of interesting, isn't it?  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:46):**  I mean, I think there's a lot of spillover effect too.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:48):**  So these things become inspirational to people.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:50):**  Um, you know, things that we accepted, you know, back, back in the day as the right thing  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:14:55):**  to do, you know, and we now look at as the wrong things.

**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:16:23):**  you know?

**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:16:30):**  Um, which is, you know, it's sort of terrifying.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:16:31):**  I mean, you know, there is a lot of doom and gloom out there.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:16:33):**  We've got some pretty, pretty shocking, you know, evidence now, of course, on climate

**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:16:54):**  uh, you know, only a very small amount of actual nature surviving and thriving.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:16:59):**  I mean, I mean, what is the statistic that, you know, out of, you know, out of all of  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:17:03):**  the, out of all of the, um, animals on the planet, you know, there's only like 10% they're  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:17:08):**  actually wild animals, 90% humans.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:17:09):**  60% of wildlife has been wiped out in the last 50 years.

**[0:17:14-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:17:14):**  If you, if you go by the blue zones of a hundred years.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:17:17):**  Yeah.

**[0:17:27-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:17:27):**  can we get?

**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:17:32):**  There is still a lot of nature out there that we can protect and we need to rewire them  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:17:36):**  protect these spaces fully.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:17:37):**  Not just, not just put, you know, lines on a map that says they're zoned off as a, as

**[0:17:48-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:17:48):**  protected so people can't take anything out of them.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:17:51):**  People can't, you know, extract, you know, whether it's, you know, oil, minerals or,  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:17:55):**  or nature from those zones, because actually, you know, nature does have a great capacity  
**[0:18:00-0:18:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:18:00):**  to regenerate and thrive again.

**[0:18:19-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:18:19):**  to what, you know, what, how much space do we really need to rewild and, and, and, and  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:18:26):**  sort of save, um, and how much can that then keep, um, you know, population functioning  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:18:32):**  properly on the planet as the population's growing.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:18:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:18:36):**  Cause even if we go back to this side out in 1990 to where we are now, so you have the  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:18:41):**  population growth in that period of time, but you're recognizing by normal people in

**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:18:50):**  So if you look at from when this started in 1990 to where it is now, you know, what, how,  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:18:56):**  how's, how's that work percentage wise to clean up?  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:18:58):**  So what have we seen the difference in oceans from 1990 to where they are now?  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:19:03):**  Well, it depends on the metrics we're really looking at.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:19:07):**  If we look at it on a very sort of, sort of, as it were the most basic level, you know,  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:19:11):**  the campaigns that we, you know, ran on water quality, you know, helped create a really  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:19:16):**  big shift, an improvement in water quality in the UK.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:19:19):**  So we went from what would have been just 27% of UK beaches passing the minimum European  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:19:24):**  standards in 1990 to now, you know, above sort of 95% typically every year.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:19:30):**  And that's really good.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:19:32):**  Those standards also mask a few, you know, they're reported in a way there's some testing

**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:19:45):**  That's amazing.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:19:46):**  Right.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:19:47):**  And that really came about through strong legislation.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:19:49):**  It wasn't just business going, oh, we, you know, we shouldn't be putting sewage in the

**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:19:59):**  in Brussels that then got put into UK law that said the water companies had to make  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:20:04):**  this investment by these dates.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:20:05):**  And that's what happened.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:20:06):**  And that says we're part of that journey.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:20:09):**  You know, we weren't the only part of that journey, but we're part of that journey.

**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:20:17):**  we're sort of often unless we're really forced to do things through legislation, we won't

**[0:20:27-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:20:27):**  if it costs them money.

**[0:20:30-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:20:30):**  Because they're not looking at bigger picture, unfortunately, are they?  
**[0:20:32-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:20:32):**  No.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:20:33):**  It's that small, that's that growth.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:20:35):**  Well, really, they're looking at paying their shareholders at the end of the share.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:20:38):**  It's the wrong end of growth, isn't it?  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:20:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:20:41):**  And it's sad because, you know, what we can't, you know, what we need to grow is nature around  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:20:48):**  us and truly grow it.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:20:49):**  Not use some, you know, sort of as it were, council strategy that says they're growing  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:20:57):**  nature without actually growing it, you know, by putting up a few, you know, a couple of

**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:21:04):**  And what we really need to do is really grow nature and find out, you know, where we're  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:21:08):**  going to really protect for the future.

**[0:21:15-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:21:15):**  having the trees and the clean ocean and the clean streams and rivers and grasslands and  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:21:22):**  all of the flora and fauna that go with that actually functioning as a system.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:21:25):**  Because all of those things function together.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:21:27):**  You know, I'm, you know, I'm not a scientist, but, you know, it's well versed.

**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:21:36):**  You know, all of these these things we need to protect are codependent.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:21:39):**  We don't just need to protect the elephants or the rhinos or the bees.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:21:43):**  You know, there's lots of things about the big scale protection of nature is what we  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:21:47):**  need to do.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:21:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:21:49):**  And it starts with me.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:21:50):**  I always think it's about reconnecting humans to that.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:21:54):**  Then we can fall in the fallback in love with it.  
**[0:21:57-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:21:57):**  Yeah.

**[0:22:01-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:22:01):**  That's the point, right?  
**[0:22:02-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:22:02):**  Absolutely.

**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:22:06):**  It's a pure disconnect.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:22:07):**  I see it from nature, the nature's deficit disorder.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:22:12):**  I mean, you know, I only see it through the prism of friends and family.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:22:19):**  But, you know, there's no doubt a mental health crisis.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:22:23):**  You know, other professionals I talk to, you know, talk about the crisis within their workforces  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:22:27):**  of how many people are ill and suffering.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:22:30):**  And you know, I think we're in a perfect storm.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:22:32):**  I think people are hooked to their screens.

**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:22:45):**  So you can never ever escape and you can never feel that you're truly sort of free.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:22:49):**  And then we're in a very comparative, competitive society.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:22:51):**  You know, in social media, you know, every, every platform is geared there to be competitive

**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:22:58):**  That's the way they get you to do more with them by going, right, okay, these people are  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:23:02):**  doing this.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:23:03):**  So you've got to do a bit more.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:23:04):**  Absolutely.

**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:23:08):**  there's the huge positives of it, right?  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:23:11):**  Oh, absolutely.

**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:23:13):**  I could, I found, I found, you know, my interviews all the way along, it's all being organized  
**[0:23:19-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:23:19):**  all through social media.

**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:23:23):**  I guess it has to have that positive lens of what it is we're putting out again into  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:23:27):**  the world.

**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:23:32):**  seems nuts using technology to reconnect and rewind, but it can, you know, it's gotta be,  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:23:37):**  it's gotta be possible, right?

**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:23:43):**  And I agree with you, but you know, I'd look at it, you know, maybe it's, you know, it's  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:23:48):**  a, it's a bad example.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:23:50):**  You know, there's foods that people shouldn't eat too much of that are delicious and brilliant  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:23:55):**  and can be good in, in, you know, the right sort of doses, you know?  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:24:01):**  And I think the same applies to social media.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:24:03):**  I mean, people are just too hooked on it and it's, you know, it's, you know, it's a, it's

**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:30:21):**  Because we visited Constantine Bow and they've got a little litter pick and plaque there.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:30:26):**  No, those boards, I think you're talking about the Two Minute Beach Clean, that's another

**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:30:38):**  Constantine, the little car park, little kiosk to buy a tea and then bam, you're hit with  
**[0:30:43-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:30:43):**  that.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:30:44):**  It's a really lovely initiative, a really great organization.

**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:30:51):**  And every piece of plastic that we pick up from the beach, every piece that we remove  
**[0:30:55-0:30:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:30:55):**  is a real victory.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:30:56):**  I think the key, as I say, within all of these groups is not to assign the blame to the individual.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:31:03):**  So the whole littering per se, back in, I think it was the 50s, Keep America Beautiful  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:31:13):**  brought together an ad campaign with Burst and Marsteller to actually make plastic pollution

**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:31:23):**  starts with the individual and it ends with the individual.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:31:26):**  And actually that's something we really contest.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:31:29):**  So the littering construct is something we understand.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:31:32):**  There are litters out there, but actually the responsibility for that is with industry  
**[0:31:36-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:31:36):**  and government.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:31:37):**  There's a hierarchy there that comes from that system.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:31:39):**  To help us live the way we need to do.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:31:41):**  Because ultimately if we focus too much on littering per se within that agenda, what  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:31:46):**  happens is the corporates go, well, that's great.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:31:49):**  Let's just keep pushing it to the end of pipe solution where people pick up.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:31:52):**  Hand over the responsibility.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:31:53):**  And that's it.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:31:54):**  When really what they need to do is create much more closed loop recycling systems.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:31:58):**  They need to eliminate as much of their packaging as possible, reduce the amount, change their  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:02):**  packaging materials wherever possible and make sure that they give to the consumer a  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:07):**  much more sustainable option.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:09):**  Because if not, we're just going to be endlessly picking up more and more stuff.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:12):**  And ultimately that either gets incinerated or buried in the ground and some of it will  
**[0:32:16-0:32:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:16):**  get recycled, which isn't really efficient.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:18):**  The best way to do it is deal with it through design and manufacture, not through picking  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:23):**  it up.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:24):**  Yeah, it definitely needs to change at that level.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:25):**  But at the same time, we're really willing to carry on picking up.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:28):**  We mobilize a hundred thousand brilliant volunteers.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:30):**  They pick up plastic from the beach, they monitor what plastics we're finding.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:34):**  They hold the big brands to account for the plastics they're putting into our system.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:38):**  And that's why they're so important.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:39):**  It brings the community together to say, not that we're going to clean up forever, but  
**[0:32:43-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:43):**  say we've had enough and we need change to happen now.

**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:50):**  So what we do is we will bring together, so for example, we did the biggest brand audit  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:32:56):**  in the UK of brands we're finding at the beach.

**[0:33:05-0:33:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:33:05):**  brands.

**[0:33:10-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:33:10):**  That data then fed into the government's consultation on extended producer responsibility to hold

**[0:33:34-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:33:34):**  And that's what we're there to do.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:33:36):**  That's what we're there to do.

**[0:33:38-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:33:38):**  So yeah.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:33:39):**  So it's good.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:33:40):**  And you know, I just want to make sure that the beaches that we have around here, the  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:33:43):**  beautiful beaches, Parenport, St. Agnes, Chapelport, all of the beaches around Cornwall in the  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:33:48):**  country and around the world can be protected for future generations.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:33:53):**  So beaches, as Jack Cousteau said, the great unifier of people.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:33:56):**  It's a place that, you know, you're sort of, you know, stripped of sort of everything really.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:01):**  You know, you're sort of all equal on the beach and in the ocean.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:05):**  And so it's an amazing place that sort of takes away this sort of hierarchical, this  
**[0:34:12-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:12):**  very competitive society and just brings people together.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:15):**  So it's a really, really beneficial, positive space, you know, healthy, active space for  
**[0:34:21-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:21):**  young people and for the future, hopefully.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:23):**  Let's try and keep it that way.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:25):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:26):**  I think that's a good place to finish, man.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:28):**  I like that.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:29):**  Good.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:30):**  Well, thank you very much.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:31):**  It's been a pleasure to talk to you.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:32):**  It's been beautiful.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:34):**  It's been good.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:35):**  So you got 10 more miles to run?  
**[0:34:36-0:34:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:37):**  Straight from here.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:38):**  So James gave me a lift back to the where I just finished off.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:42):**  Yep.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:43):**  And then 10 miles and then back home.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:46):**  So what sort of pace do you do, remind me?  
**[0:34:48-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:48):**  Depends, man.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:49):**  I shot off a bit quick yesterday morning.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:51):**  I think I probably ate 8.35 minute miles.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:34:58):**  And then the second leg again was a bit slower.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:00):**  And then the third leg in was breezing again.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:05):**  So at the moment, like today, I think I've just gone, I think it's like 10.35 minute  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:10):**  miles.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:11):**  Not really just ticking over.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:15):**  And then it just keeps me, I can keep relaxed.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:17):**  I've worked with a lot of nasal breathers.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:19):**  The nasal breathing just really just tune in.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:22):**  So it's a form almost going to like states of meditation I'd say.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:26):**  And I'm bringing chanting in now and the chanting is quite interesting.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:29):**  Okay.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:30):**  When it opens up.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:31):**  And suddenly I'm like, right, I think I better stop that now just in case I can't.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:34):**  I love it.

**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:38):**  So just 10 miles, 10 miles to go.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:40):**  And from where to where to, is that 10 miles now?  
**[0:35:42-0:35:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:42):**  Where am I running, James?  
**[0:35:43-0:35:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:43):**  Where have I got next?  
**[0:35:44-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:44):**  James behind the lens.

**[0:35:47-0:35:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:35:47):**  Hold on, I'll do it here.

**[0:36:05-0:36:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:36:05):**  Okay.

**[0:36:09-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:36:09):**  Okay.

**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:36:15):**  And then food and a good night's rest.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:36:16):**  I might actually do a swim.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:36:17):**  Okay.

**[0:36:25-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:36:25):**  Yeah.

**[0:36:28-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:36:28):**  It's nice to reignite that.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8#t=0:36:29):**  Beautiful place, yeah.

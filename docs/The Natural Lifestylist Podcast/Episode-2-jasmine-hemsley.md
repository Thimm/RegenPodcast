### The Natural Lifestylist Podcast  (Sun, 08 Sep 2019 10:01:45)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:00:00):**  Hi I'm Tony Riddle and this is the Natural Lifestylist podcast. So way back  
**[0:00:06-0:00:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:00:06):**  in December I had this crazy idea that I was going to run 900 miles from Lands End  
**[0:00:12-0:00:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:00:12):**  to John O'Groats in 30 days but not just that I was gonna do it barefoot and yet  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:00:19):**  that would raise socially extreme eyebrows but it also would raise funds  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:00:24):**  so with that socially extreme eyebrow it created a platform gave me an  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:00:30):**  opportunity to raise awareness and funds for environmental charities and  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:00:34):**  collaborate with leading experts to raise awareness and money for six  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:00:39):**  organizations fighting the top sustainability issues of that time. I  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:00:44):**  knew of course that running barefoot would raise those eyebrows and with  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:00:48):**  those eyebrows I'd be able to provide a platform a perfect platform to highlight  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:00:53):**  the importance of connecting with our environment and those all-important key  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:00:59):**  sustainability issues of that time. So I had the pleasure of getting behind the  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:01:04):**  mic with my well-being sister the one and only Jasmine Hemsley. Jasmine is a

**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:01:28):**  believes that small key changes in everyday lives can create a profound

**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:02:09):**  soul and to put it more simply just wants to help us all be more human. I  
**[0:02:14-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:02:14):**  hope you enjoy the conversation. So I'm here with the lovely Jasmine Hemsley. Hemsley!  
**[0:02:23-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:02:23):**  Why do I keep saying Hemsley? Because I'm going to call you little. Tony little. Okay, start again. I'm here with the lovely Jasmine Hemsley. That's right.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:02:32):**  Because I keep getting that wrong. I must have been getting that wrong for years now. Years and years and years. I laugh. I answer to it. You must have called me Jasmine Hemsley. So you know when I  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:02:40):**  started out on this map this idea of embarking on this huge journey, not life  
**[0:02:46-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:02:46):**  but the 30-day challenge. You were one of the first names that popped up. It's been  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:02:52):**  great witnessing kind of the evolution of Jasmine. I first met you I think on a  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:02:59):**  Vivo Barefoot shoot right? That was you and Melissa. We were going through tekkers and how you  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:03:04):**  should stand. Yes. For the perfect shot. For looking like the wrong pose. So it's just perfectly  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:03:09):**  aligned with today right? As I've just been finding that perfect pose for 20 miles  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:03:13):**  before getting here. Had you just seen me walking up the road you would never have  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:03:18):**  guessed. But anyway back to that. And then you're in modeling right? And now you  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:03:22):**  seem to now we've moved right into what would be kind of one of those big voice  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:03:28):**  of in sustainable fashion I would say. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah which has been great.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:03:32):**  I've loved watching that. So let's talk a little bit around that journey. What  
**[0:03:39-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:03:39):**  happened? What happened from that moment with Vivo Barefoot, a bit of modeling to  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:03:47):**  the rise of... I'm not going to say wellness guru because you probably hate guru like  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:03:51):**  I do. I just don't like being labeled as that. So wellness, wellbeing, expert. A voice in it.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:03:57):**  How does that sound? Very good. Nice little intro isn't it? Yeah it was really nice. I'm kind of jealous of your  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:04:03):**  beard, your beard chin rest thing. It's great. It is. I do it because otherwise I get this.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:04:09):**  And it really annoys people. I did have to do a podcast once where they told me to plaster it to my chin.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:04:14):**  Never be jealous of your beard Jasmine. No? I don't think no. You look a bit weird that way. Careful what you wish for.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:04:19):**  Not sure how sustainable that would be. How did I get here? I guess I just began to not open just my eyes but my other  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:04:31):**  senses to the world around me a bit more and also turn in a bit more. So I just  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:04:36):**  became a bit more aware of my actions and of my inner world. But this has all  
**[0:04:41-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:04:41):**  happened on a very very very slow snail pace in many ways way because I didn't  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:04:50):**  have an epiphany or I didn't have a didn't suddenly think of a business plan.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:04:53):**  In fact I kind of fall into a lot of things I do and it's only in retrospect  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:04:57):**  I realized that I had at one point kind of manifested or decided that this is an  
**[0:05:02-0:05:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:05:02):**  area that I saw myself in. Yeah it's not like it's a complete rudderless shit. No you might think that when you watch me in my day to day.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:05:10):**  But I am a bit all over the place. But you know when I do get quiet and I do  
**[0:05:17-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:05:17):**  daydream I do see myself not really knowing what my job is or calling it a  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:05:26):**  particular action or title. It's more I kind of feel where I want to be existing  
**[0:05:33-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:05:33):**  and I think you know I don't have that much to report from my teens and my  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:05:41):**  childhood but you know there are times when you feel a little bit like you  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:05:44):**  don't really know what's going on it's all kind of happening and it's and I  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:05:48):**  would say anxiety was quite present or at least you know I was sorry mum and  
**[0:05:54-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:05:54):**  dad. Worry was part of my templates. Yeah yeah yeah always trying to think  
**[0:06:02-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:06:02):**  about always trying to think ahead always trying to you know and living in  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:06:10):**  the land of the memories I guess it's just that there's not much now in the future and past.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:06:13):**  There's not much now, no there is not and now I realize you know it's not it's  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:06:19):**  something that I have to keep reminding myself but it's that gap between the  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:06:25):**  memories of what just happened or days gone by and the unknown of the future  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:06:31):**  and it's that gap that is the real place where I'm at and how do I enjoy that gap  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:06:36):**  how do I enjoy what I've got now or maybe not even enjoy it how do I just  
**[0:06:39-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:06:39):**  experience it and it really just started off I guess from wanting to eat better  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:06:46):**  or really really kind of understanding that my mother's food made me feel great  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:06:52):**  and then there's this there's this idea of what healthy food was back in the  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:06:59):**  time when I decided that my mom's food was what was making me feel great so  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:07:02):**  let's say the late 90s and suddenly eatery started popping up and suddenly I  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:07:07):**  started earning money and I would go out and you know start to eat at different  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:07:13):**  places and I kind of realized that food didn't make me feel nourish and then I  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:07:17):**  thought is it just Filipino food my mom's Filipino my dad's English I kind  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:07:20):**  of realized earlier on I like I like wet dinners and I also have a taste for  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:07:24):**  green food you know I was lucky that my mom put a lot of greens in my food  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:07:26):**  growing up so I like that bitter astringent taste but I also loved all  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:07:31):**  meals I loved I loved culture I loved trying different dishes when I watch TV  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:07:37):**  and watched chefs you know go around the world cooking things and you know I  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:07:42):**  didn't have access to any restaurants the only way to to taste that flavor was  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:07:47):**  to cook it myself so I began to cook and then I entered the world of modeling and  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:07:52):**  that's where you realize you know you start getting on the oh gotta be healthy  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:07:56):**  gotta be healthy and yeah back then it was about calories it was about low fat  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:08:02):**  it was about nothing definitely not wet food is about almost food being  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:08:08):**  separated on your plate and suddenly looking at it in this kind of protein  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:08:11):**  fats and carbohydrates kind of way yeah dividing the plate divide the plate yeah  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:08:15):**  and fist hand thumb yes and then looking at the back of packets yeah kind of  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:08:20):**  understanding things and I thought gosh I just I just love my mom's stews that

**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:08:26):**  complicated yeah less complicated lots of comfort and the more I started to  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:08:32):**  research into healthy eating and you know and all these words came up vegan  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:08:36):**  vegetarian paleo raw food different philosophies I evaded kept coming up so  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:08:42):**  from my early 20s this philosophy of I evader which I've only really started to  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:08:47):**  talk about in a big way in the last couple of years has just been there I  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:08:50):**  didn't know it was quite recent no a lot of this stuff is super it's in the  
**[0:08:56-0:08:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:08:56):**  closet and I wasn't sure my what my relationship with I evaded was really  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:08:59):**  because I was implementing it bit by bit it was so vast it was such a different  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:09:03):**  language to the one I was used to talking you know it's very you know

**[0:09:10-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:09:10):**  up very linear X plus Y equals Z and and so there's a lot to take on and luckily  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:09:19):**  my world around me changed at the same time and made that transition a lot  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:09:23):**  easier so you know when I first came across it never heard of a mantra a  
**[0:09:27-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:09:27):**  chakra om any of those kind of ideas but as I got more into it I started to hear  
**[0:09:36-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:09:36):**  it there see it there see it there see it there hear it there and it all became  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:09:39):**  a little bit more familiar and now you turn up you know to get behind the mic  
**[0:09:42-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:09:42):**  and pull out the tuning for amazing so I you know if I'd seen that 20 years ago I  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:09:52):**  don't think I necessarily been swept up in it but my journey has been steady and  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:09:56):**  slow and so I've integrated what's made sense to me at the time and it's become  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:10:00):**  a part of who I am today and so a lot of well I evade and functional medicine I  
**[0:10:06-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:10:06):**  was very interested in functional medicine went into the philosophy behind  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:10:09):**  Hemsley and Hemsley and it's it's really it's the tried and tested stuff that I  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:10:13):**  was doing on myself and then as time was gone on and I've watched the functional  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:10:18):**  medicine world really keep coming back to I avada I've realized if I avada is  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:10:23):**  the manual of nature the manual for life and it's it's directly translates as the  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:10:29):**  science of life or the knowledge of life then is that not where we're all headed  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:10:33):**  is that not the big picture yeah because I know the more I go down that path and  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:10:38):**  the more I investigate because I hold things like rewarding isn't it mmm and  
**[0:10:42-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:10:42):**  it's as if that's what it's in its essence in a way is at a time I guess  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:10:49):**  when it was dealing with the ills of what was becoming a civilization and  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:10:52):**  farming and then returning people back to what would be that holistic balance  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:10:57):**  again yeah which is introducing them to the natural way of living again yes yes  
**[0:11:01-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:11:01):**  all right absolutely so I avada is um it's really understanding that you are  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:11:08):**  nature and you are of nature so there is you know to be able to kind of take a

**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:11:20):**  constant is change and rather than that making things more complicated it's  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:11:24):**  actually a much more simple and romantic way to look at life you know that you

**[0:15:09-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:15:09):**  stitch from the side of her mouth but yeah she's alright. He was showing off about how dirty his feet were but honestly two minutes with me in the garden and my feet look the same.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:15:17):**  Yeah I mean they're dirty but they're in great shape. They're in great shape.

**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:15:28):**  some eye on Instagram and she is from Taunton and she knew I was here and she  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:15:33):**  just said to me as a she's a you know a therapist herself she said that my book

**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:15:44):**  percent so that she can carry on what she's doing. Well it was beyond that wasn't it? I mean the lady had a  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:15:48):**  stroke, her digestion was out, she's completely healed her digestion and her symptoms are just

**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:16:07):**  doing so I think if you can just find your balance you know that's what Ayurveda  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:16:12):**  is it's the balance that the delicate balance between mind body and spirit and  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:16:17):**  it's not that you want to stay on that pivot and be absolutely rigid structured  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:16:20):**  and controlled as we said it's that oh we've got to have some movement otherwise life's  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:16:24):**  not interesting so you can pivot this way pivot that way and smoothly keep  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:16:28):**  coming back a couple of doinks you know up and down recover quickly that's you  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:16:33):**  know by keeping near the balance near the pivot point you can recover quickly  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:16:36):**  that's a strange noise should we clarify what that is? Oh yes so we're in

**[0:16:56-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:16:56):**  And look isn't that amazing? She's got a baby carrier. She's got a baby strapped to her front and she's filling up her little cloth bag with coffee.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:17:04):**  It did sound like someone was having a pee. Did it sound like it sounded like it? I thought so. My pee's don't sound like that.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:17:10):**  It was a tricky one.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:17:12):**  Okay right we might edit that bit out. No we're not. Let's keep that.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:17:18):**  So okay so remember we were talking about balance so I met your guy what was his name Dr. Matthew?  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:17:24):**  Yes she Jo Matthew. Yeah because up until that point I've always looked at digestion and looked at cellular stuff  
**[0:17:30-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:17:30):**  and it was such a it was a different approach because it was about understanding my dosha.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:17:38):**  You know? Yeah. And suddenly it was like ah okay because there's certain stuff that was being flagged up for me through  
**[0:17:44-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:17:44):**  having a stool sample, microbiome test and cellular work, the blood work.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:17:51):**  And there was certain figures within that system that they're perfectly aligned with dosha as well which is quite interesting.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:17:57):**  So can we go into dosha's a bit because I find that stuff's like just powerful.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:18:01):**  For sure for sure. I mean I you know the science and technology we have at our fingertips now is immense.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:18:07):**  But I still believe that it's the power of the person interpreting it still putting that together and building the big picture.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:18:16):**  Because you know we can measure with incredible accuracy certain things going on in the body but again everything's about the balance you know.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:18:23):**  We all have E. coli in our body. E. coli sounds horrendous but the right amount is okay.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:18:28):**  Yeah it's a symbiotic relationship. Exactly. When it's out of balance it's a dysbiosis right? Yes.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:18:33):**  On every level. Yes. Could be microbiome in the mouth, it could be skin, it could be gut, it could be anything right?  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:18:39):**  So I feel like you know we need the people to interpret those results and build the picture.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:18:45):**  And I also believe that we ourselves are the best person to kind of begin to understand ourselves and that's what life's journey I think is really all about.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:18:54):**  I'm with you on that. I honestly feel that part of this process for me has been like the reboot reconnecting world thing I talked about is about those innate abilities and getting back to that position.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:19:04):**  Where I honestly think we would have been again moving through a landscape knowing exactly what we needed.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:19:10):**  And part of growth now is to find the people along the route to help interpret that so we become more skilful and therefore we can return to being those innate wild beings.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:19:20):**  And then the younger years they inherit that new information. Do you know what I mean? So we have to go and do the work don't we?  
**[0:19:28-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:19:28):**  Oh look at Gen Z's now they're just completely you know. Fashion brands, any brands just don't even know how to market these guys.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:19:36):**  The Gen Z's. Gen Z's are like the ones in their 20s aren't they? They operate at a completely different level. They're thinking differently. They've grown up on technology.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:19:44):**  Oh yeah because James is 23. James what's a Gen Z? Are you a Gen Z? Are you a Gen Z? I think you're a Gen Z. Yeah give it a little eye. Yeah yeah yeah. Gen Z behind the camera.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:19:53):**  Gen Z. It sounds very cool. It does sound like JZ. JZ Gen Z.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:19:58):**  So the doshas. So for anyone that knows or doesn't know about the about Ayurveda they have these.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:20:07):**  Ayurveda uses descriptions to build a picture. So our senses are very much involved in building that full picture.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:20:17):**  And the doshas are really the five elements in subgroups. So in Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine etc etc they have roughly five elements.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:20:29):**  They differ from what they're called but for me it's one's French one's German you know which is still telling the same poem about love but in a different language.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:20:38):**  So in Ayurveda it's ether or space. So nothing happens unless there is a space for it to happen. Then you have air. So we can talk about the wind, the air that we breathe, you could look at the sky. Imagine a picture.  
**[0:20:52-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:20:52):**  So the picture itself would be the space. The air you could... The space you could interpret as like even universe right? Exactly. Okay right. Exactly. Nothing happened. There's no big bang unless it's within that space.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:21:04):**  And then you have the air which we can look at as just the sky. Then you've got fire which you can think of as the sun or maybe a fire in front of you, a bonfire.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:21:15):**  Maybe the fire in your belly or the fire in every cell in your body that's transformed. Combustion. Combustion. Then you've got water which you can think of as the sea in the picture.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:21:26):**  And then you've got earth which you can think of as the ground. So when I first started hearing about the five elements and I did a form of Wing Chun that was five elements when I was younger.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:21:38):**  I loved it when I was doing it but I didn't really think it had any relevance to my life today. And it was only when I was... I remember being in Croatia camping and I looked out and there was my view.  
**[0:21:49-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:21:49):**  And it was the sun setting and there was space, the air of the sky, the sun setting on the water and then the earth below. And I thought that's the five elements.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:22:01):**  And what Ayurveda is saying is we can use those five elements to describe everything in and around us. So we're sitting on reclaimed wood.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:22:14):**  Driftwood. So we could say this is very earthy. It's really earthy, it's solid, it's big in comparison to maybe a piece of plywood which would be more...  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:22:28):**  So this would be made of earth and water, right?  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:22:30):**  Earth and water, yes. If we dried this out a bit more it would be much more earth because it would have lost some of its water.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:22:36):**  So if we then, if we dunk this driftwood back into the sea, where it drifted in from, it would have more water than a piece of driftwood sitting out in the sun.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:22:45):**  So it's just comparisons, it's not pigeonholing necessarily, it's just using it to compare the qualities around us.  
**[0:22:52-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:22:52):**  And so what Ayurveda has done is put those five elements into three doshas. And because this five goes into three it's not nice and exacting as we like it.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:23:01):**  It can be a bit confusing but let's say...  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:23:03):**  Remove the control mechanism.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:23:05):**  Remove the control mechanism. So we take the first two, space and air combined to form vata.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:23:12):**  So vata, a Sanskrit word, we can call it very roughly air but it's responsible for any movement in the body, any messaging, the nervous system, the breath going in and out.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:23:23):**  So movement within the body, vayu's, is vata.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:23:27):**  Then we have pitta. So pitta is the elements of fire and water, so it's hot liquid spreading oily.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:23:35):**  And then we have kapha which is the earth, earth and water.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:23:41):**  So pitta and kapha share water as a shared element.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:23:45):**  So kapha can be quite sticky.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:23:48):**  Kapha can be sticky, can be like mucusy, it's very grounded down to earth, it's solid. Think of it as sand and water together.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:23:57):**  Add a bit of pitta and you've baked it and you've got like a vessel.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:24:01):**  Add some water and that vessel slowly disintegrates away back into space.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:24:07):**  So it's about the relationship between everything.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:24:11):**  But the brilliant thing is we can use that to kind of talk about people's personalities, their mental traits, their physical traits.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:24:18):**  So you're quite a pitta person. I can see from the red tones in your skin, the red in your beard, the focus that you have.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:24:28):**  The dragon in my spiritual ceremonies.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:24:31):**  The one that's saying things like pain cave, pain cave.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:24:36):**  But it doesn't mean that you won't have vata attributes. So when you're thinking, where can I take this? What can I do with this?  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:24:41):**  I've got a message to get out there. Oh, I could start doing this and I could start, I could do this run.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:24:47):**  I could use the pitta.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:24:49):**  And you use the pitta as the drive, but the vata is the creativity, the stimulation.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:24:54):**  And that's exactly my reading.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:24:56):**  But then there's also kapha in you.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:24:58):**  Is there? Because of course you are tri, aren't you?  
**[0:25:01-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:25:01):**  You are tri.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:25:02):**  Tridosia. It's just your... You have a dominant. Exactly. A dominant or dual dominant.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:25:07):**  Or you could be roughly all three, equally split. And that would be tridosic.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:25:11):**  So all the elements are in us because we are everything.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:25:15):**  Got it. So I was a bit kapha back there on my own.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:25:19):**  You were hitting the, you know, you just, you were drained.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:25:23):**  And also you need that groundedness because vata is cold and stimulated.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:25:28):**  Pitta is hot and stimulated. Kapha is cooling and calming and grounded and earthy, you know, mother earth.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:25:35):**  So although we say here when we're looking at this word, it's very kapha with some, with some, you know, very earth, with some water.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:25:42):**  But it's also got air and space in it.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:25:46):**  You can see there's literally space in between, you know, the, in between the pieces.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:25:52):**  Some bits are drier than others. It's got a lot more of the air.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:25:57):**  So it's all in us. It's just what is your dominant dosha type?  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:26:03):**  So people say to you, what's your dosha? They mean, what's your dominant dosha in the mind body?  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:26:08):**  And that's generally meaning what we born as. So you're prakriti.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:26:13):**  So we're all born with a kind of genetic constitution. And mine is vata pitta.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:26:19):**  But because of the work I do and I live in London, a very vata environment, a very vata pitta environment, actually.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:26:25):**  But it's currently coming into autumn, which is a vata season, cold, dry, rough.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:26:31):**  The leaves are drying up. The seasons are in there. So you think about a tree, you know, a, what are they called?  
**[0:26:38-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:26:38):**  A deciduous perennial or a tree that goes through, you know, the cycles as we, you know, from the fresh buds in spring to the leafy abundance in summer.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:26:49):**  And then drying up in the autumn and becoming crisp and curling up and changing colour and then falling away and becoming covered in snow and soggy.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:26:56):**  And, you know, that's very kaffir. So that happens to all of us.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:27:00):**  So as we move into autumn, actually, you know, science is, you know, research shows that it's actually a very anxiety inducing time.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:27:09):**  Whether you put that down to the end of summer fun, the light levels dropping, that back to school feeling, you know, the darker nights moving in.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:27:18):**  You know, Ayurveda would read it as that plus the idea that it's a vata season and therefore vata has an effect on your nervous system.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:27:26):**  And that's why there's this collective feeling of a little bit more grumpy.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:27:36):**  It's the best word for it.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:27:37):**  Grumpy and irritable, you know.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:27:39):**  So really being able to combine this stuff that we're discovering through science and the ancient wisdom, we're just building an even better picture.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:27:50):**  So I love that they're talking about Ayurveda in Parliament.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:27:54):**  I love that people are, people can come and read about Ayurveda and take one, two, three things and all of them will have a massive impact because when you go with Ayurveda, you're going with nature.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:28:05):**  And that's always a good thing.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:28:06):**  So let's go back to Ayurveda in Parliament.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:28:08):**  What's happening there?  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:28:09):**  They're just, you know, if you think about the NHS is struggling, you know, it's a disease management system.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:28:15):**  Well, I got to see it, you know, my mum had pneumonia at Christmas, you know, she got rushed in on, I think, Christmas Day.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:28:22):**  And she had a good few weeks in Oxford and they do an amazing job when they're in there.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:28:27):**  But it's just the worst environment.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:28:29):**  It's like the worst environment for healing and all that.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:28:31):**  There's a noise, there's a sound, bright lights on, really, really harsh lights, you know, overly hot windows shut.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:28:39):**  And talking about sustainability, I mean, the amount of waste.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:28:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:28:43):**  It's insane.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:28:44):**  And then people, you know, are low energy, low vibration around you.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:28:48):**  It's a place of, you know, sickness, it's a place of sadness.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:28:51):**  Then obviously they're yuking the food.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:28:55):**  So this is food that sat in storage for how long or, you know, come from somewhere else and then it's sitting around or it's been vacuum packed and it's nuked and it's got no prana or cheese.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:29:04):**  Yeah, it's not food by then.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:29:05):**  It's not food, you know, and, you know, there's not enough staffing.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:29:10):**  It's, you know, my dad had cancer three times and so over 15 years, you know, we were in and out of hospital and it's a very difficult place to heal.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:29:20):**  Even though on a physical level they can do so much for you mentally and spiritually, it's a...  
**[0:29:24-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:29:24):**  And is that where we're seeing Ayurveda coming in? Do you think it's coming in?  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:29:27):**  I think we're looking wider afield.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:29:31):**  We're realising that we can't work in this way any longer.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:29:36):**  And I think people are realising through this wellbeing movement that's become huge that we have a responsibility to take care of ourselves and we have a responsibility to try and understand more about our needs.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:29:48):**  To look at how people were doing things two generations ago and saying, what can I take from that?  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:29:53):**  You know, for me, when I give talks, I say, what time do Granny and Granddad eat?  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:29:58):**  And people look up and say, 5.30, 6, 6.30pm.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:30:02):**  Yes, they did.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:30:03):**  You know, if you look around a lot of cultures, they don't eat past sunset or you might look at it as, you know, stop eating three hours before sleep so you can finish digesting and then go into a proper deep healing sleep.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:30:16):**  And for me, that changed my life in my mid-twenties, I'd say.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:30:20):**  So I used to eat about 8.30 at night.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:30:23):**  Yeah, there's lighting implications in that as well, isn't there?  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:30:25):**  Absolutely, absolutely.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:30:27):**  So the light, you know, we go camping, the sun and then the darkness that follows, that tells the body what's happening, the melatonin being released.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:30:40):**  And so we know when we go camping, if anyone has gone camping, without your phones, without artificial light, without artificial stimulation,  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:30:49):**  you know, you sit around that campfire and you start to feel ridiculously relaxed and sleepy.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:30:54):**  You're completely down-regulated, aren't you?  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:30:56):**  Oh my goodness, you're like, what is that?  
**[0:30:57-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:30:57):**  I remember going on my first trip to Devon to visit Nick's mum and the fresh air hit me like a, you know, I turned into a sack of potatoes, basically.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:05):**  I just, I couldn't move. I was so used to the adrenaline, the energy buzz of living in London.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:10):**  So was that the first time you met them?  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:11):**  When I, yeah, I basically couldn't speak.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:14):**  I bet they were like, she's alive, you know, Nick.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:16):**  The fatigue, the fatigue that came out, you know, she's feeding me all her best cooking and I'm doing a grand job of putting it away.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:23):**  And then, you know, you're sitting out on the porch and I basically couldn't speak.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:27):**  I thought, wow, this is a proper holiday.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:29):**  We're taking time off. Great, I'm going to hit you when it hurts.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:31):**  Let's get some downtime.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:33):**  And it was quite scary at first.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:36):**  I was so used to being that buzzy, creative, chatty person and I thought, it's been stolen from me.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:42):**  But actually that was me on a, that wasn't the real me.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:46):**  That's Vata out of control, is it?  
**[0:31:48-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:48):**  That's Vata aggravated.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:49):**  Aggravated, not out of control, aggravated.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:51):**  Aggravated, totally aggravated.  
**[0:31:53-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:31:53):**  I am Vata, I live in a Vata environment and I wasn't doing enough grounding because, you know, like increases like.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:00):**  So I need to look to the opposite to bring balance.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:02):**  OK, so let's go to that.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:03):**  OK.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:04):**  Vata to, Vata that's aggravated.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:07):**  Aggravated.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:08):**  To balance it.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:09):**  To balance it, what do we do?  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:10):**  I need to look to the other elements.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:11):**  So Vata is space and air.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:13):**  I need to look for fire, water and earth.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:17):**  So fire.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:18):**  So Vata is cold, dry, rough, fast, erratic.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:22):**  You can tell by the way I speak, my hands are flying all over the place.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:25):**  And look what I'm wearing.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:27):**  You're in a T-shirt and because you're a pitta, I've got, you know, a cashmere top on, a pair of traxy bottoms.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:34):**  I've got my feet tucked into the creases of my legs to keep them warm.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:38):**  I'm sitting on a blanket because I like the comforts.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:41):**  And I'm sitting here thinking about an ice bath.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:43):**  Exactly.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:44):**  Exactly.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:45):**  So we're two people living, you know, the same reality and we want and need different things.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:51):**  So that's why it's not one rule for all.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:53):**  It's why one size doesn't fit all.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:56):**  You are constantly changing.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:32:57):**  And as I'm getting bossier and, you know, stepping into this role of maybe teaching and sharing right now,  
**[0:33:03-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:03):**  my pitta's coming up.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:05):**  My pitta's coming up.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:06):**  I'm warming up.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:07):**  So when I walk out and do, you know, talks, by the end of it, I have to take my jumper off because I'm so hot,  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:13):**  because my pitta's come in to kind of be that drive, that fire.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:17):**  And then I wind down and then I need to kind of get warm and comfy and cozy again.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:22):**  It's interesting, isn't it? Because we're channeling at that moment as well, aren't we?  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:24):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:25):**  Stuff that we're bringing in.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:26):**  Yes.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:27):**  So, Kaffa, what would you do for Kaffa then?  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:29):**  Kaffa. So K-A-P-H-A.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:32):**  So if you're a Kaffa person, that's a lot of water and fire, you tend to have, you know, physically,  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:37):**  you tend to have glossy hair, glossy skin, very moist skin.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:41):**  You're the kind of person that doesn't really need body lotion.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:44):**  And the idea of someone pouring oil over you is like, why?  
**[0:33:48-0:33:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:48):**  Because you're so lush anyway, if you like.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:52):**  You tend to be lush.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:53):**  Lush, Kaffa.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:54):**  You tend to be the kind of person who, oh, you missed the train.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:33:58):**  Oh, well, what's next, you know?  
**[0:34:00-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:00):**  Or something happened, you know, or someone says to you,  
**[0:34:03-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:03):**  what do you want to watch the movies or where do you want to go?  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:05):**  And you're like, yeah, whatever you think, you know, you're just, you're not,  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:09):**  you're living in your body, you're more rooted and grounded.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:13):**  But if your Kaffa gets aggravated, say you're doing a sedentary desk job,  
**[0:34:17-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:17):**  you're eating very oily foods, you're not getting enough of that kind of space, air, warmth,  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:24):**  you're quite cold as well, they're quite cold to touch.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:28):**  Then you can get very Kaffa aggravated and that might look like being a bit insular  
**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:34):**  or a bit greedy, a bit wanting to hold on to everything,  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:39):**  loving their routine so much they can't stray out of it, you know?  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:43):**  Yeah, because Katharina's got a lot of Kaffa in her.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:46):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:47):**  Or it could be, you know, that that Kaffa has to play a part  
**[0:34:50-0:34:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:50):**  because she's watching three children.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:52):**  That's like highly stimulating, you know, that's really in her brain.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:55):**  So she needs that routine because it's the opposite to the Vata.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:34:58):**  And she always says, oh, it's so good when you're around Tony  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:00):**  because it just gives me this oomph that comes in, it gives me the lift that I need.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:04):**  Well, you come and bring a lot of Pitta into the mix.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:07):**  It'll be interesting to see within relationships, right?  
**[0:35:09-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:09):**  Absolutely. So Nick is Tridoshek, he's obviously living in London,  
**[0:35:16-0:35:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:16):**  which is very Vata Pitta, so those two could get aggravated.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:19):**  But because I'm so Vata Pitta, or so Vata almost,  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:22):**  his Kaffa really comes in to be the opposite, to ground me down.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:27):**  And whenever I have a bit of a slump and I hit the kind of, you know,  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:31):**  because you can, you can get so Vata exhausted,  
**[0:35:33-0:35:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:33):**  you literally get pushed the other way.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:35):**  Of course.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:36):**  And that's when you can't get out of bed, you're feeling quite down or melancholy,  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:40):**  you don't want to move off the sofa, you don't have any drive, you know,  
**[0:35:43-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:43):**  you've run out of steam.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:45):**  Then Nick's Vata kicks in, he's like, oh, well, let's go to the park,  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:48):**  let's go and do that, I know it will be nice.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:50):**  He becomes the kind of the moving ideas force there,  
**[0:35:53-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:53):**  whereas normally that's me.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:55):**  So definitely in a partnership, or for example,  
**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:35:58):**  I could hang out with another creative Vata person  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:01):**  and one of us will step back a bit because two doing the same job,  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:07):**  what do you get? You don't, you don't get harmony, you get overkill.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:11):**  Well it's great to understand within, I mean, every relationship, isn't it?  
**[0:36:14-0:36:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:14):**  It can be in business, anything, to really understand that model of interdependence.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:18):**  It can be fantastic. Imagine we're in a company,  
**[0:36:20-0:36:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:20):**  we're going to read it on Doshan and understand what we're doing.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:23):**  I mean, if you look at Deepak Chopra, I think he's created,  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:25):**  Deepak is obviously a Western medical doctor and, you know,  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:29):**  Indian born, Indian heritage, you know, Ayurveda has very much been part of his life.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:33):**  And they've developed systems to kind of recognize your traits.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:37):**  And in fact, this is something I learned in the Vedantas,  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:40):**  which is kind of the end of knowledge, it was these classes I was taking in India.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:44):**  The actual car system in India was designed, well, not designed,  
**[0:36:48-0:36:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:48):**  it was, initially it was to understand what your qualities were  
**[0:36:53-0:36:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:53):**  and therefore to do a job that suited those qualities.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:56):**  Do you know what I mean? So if you are someone that liked routine,  
**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:36:58):**  liked to just do a job, go home at the end of the night, switch off,  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:02):**  you know, didn't aspire to be the top of the world,  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:05):**  then why would you be pushed into a top of the world job, you know?  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:08):**  And it removes like competition, removes inadequacy.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:12):**  Yeah, you get to do, you know, what do they say in Instagram, you know?  
**[0:37:16-0:37:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:16):**  If you do what you love, it doesn't feel like work.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:18):**  And yet when we go to school, or certainly how I was,  
**[0:37:22-0:37:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:22):**  how when I went to school, if you weren't academic,  
**[0:37:25-0:37:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:25):**  you were just left by the wayside, you know?  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:28):**  And that was just focusing on one form of intelligence, you know?  
**[0:37:32-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:32):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:33):**  Out the window when, you know, I think I can remember,  
**[0:37:36-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:36):**  I think I cross stitched one bookmark,  
**[0:37:38-0:37:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:38):**  I think I made a pair of Bermuda shorts when I was 12,  
**[0:37:41-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:41):**  and I think I had to sit through it, it was extremely painful at 14,  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:45):**  how to cook rice, which I'd been doing since I was nine, you know, at school.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:50):**  And then that was it, that was what all you needed as far as life skills were.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:54):**  So we're releasing these little adults into the world  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:37:59):**  who really don't know how to cook, how to grow anything.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:03):**  Or what their needs are.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:04):**  Or what their needs are.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:05):**  And that's a bit scary, and that's why I love seeing these forest schools starting up,  
**[0:38:10-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:10):**  I love seeing, my friend George Lamb has created an educational program called Grow,  
**[0:38:17-0:38:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:17):**  and they're doing their first harvest festival on Saturday.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:20):**  Oh, brilliant.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:21):**  And it's getting the children back on the land, those skills, you know?  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:23):**  And all these things were seen a couple of decades ago as beneath some people,  
**[0:38:29-0:38:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:29):**  or maybe not a good use of intelligence, or maybe a little bit like backwards.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:34):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:35):**  Which is a shame.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:36):**  A shame.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:37):**  Lost skills.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:38):**  It puts us in a forest, and apart from two days in the brownies, do you know what to do?  
**[0:38:43-0:38:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:43):**  Yeah, it is interesting, is it?  
**[0:38:45-0:38:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:45):**  Because if you look at the natural beings of the world again,  
**[0:38:48-0:38:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:48):**  it's so sophisticated, that depth of wisdom.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:52):**  Just think how many plants there are in the plant kingdom,  
**[0:38:55-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:55):**  and have that identification of plant.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:38:57):**  And then again, we'd understand naturally, I guess, not knowing the term dosho,  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:02):**  but we'd understand those personalities and energy types.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:06):**  You would just be naturally able to read it, you wouldn't know how to.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:09):**  Exactly, because it's these, and they know exactly again how to make the whole tribe grow,  
**[0:39:15-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:15):**  rather than just have a tribe of independent people.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:18):**  Yes, all mine to be the best.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:19):**  It's all one organism again.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:21):**  We all work together.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:23):**  And again, it's not so, what's the word, it's not so pigeon-holed that you are the one that collects the sticks,  
**[0:39:31-0:39:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:31):**  and therefore you are only going to be collecting six of them.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:33):**  It's not at all. So a way I like to describe it is,  
**[0:39:36-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:36):**  imagine, I don't know, going for coffee or going to the shops with one of your mates.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:42):**  And there's definitely between the two of you, there's the one that will check the road, right, before you cross it.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:48):**  And then think about going out with another mate.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:51):**  Do they also check the road, or are you the one that checks the road?  
**[0:39:54-0:39:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:54):**  Or when you go out with your child, you're the one that checks the road.  
**[0:39:56-0:39:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:56):**  You take on different roles depending on the person that you're with.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:39:59):**  That's going to look right.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:40:00):**  And what their inadequacies are, or where their strengths are, you naturally feed into that.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:40:05):**  So even within your daughters, you know, three girls raised almost in the same way,  
**[0:40:11-0:40:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:40:11):**  although they can't be the same parents, all of them,  
**[0:40:13-0:40:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:40:13):**  but they come up with different strengths at different times.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:40:16):**  And then within the three girls when they play, I bet one's normally more bossy on average.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:40:23):**  And then one day she's not.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:40:25):**  It's interesting to observe, because they all play out the characters.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:40:30):**  So they all become the character one might have been in the day before.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:40:33):**  But their own personality, of course, is driven within that character.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:40:36):**  So you really get to see it within them.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:40:38):**  But again, they're independent, aren't they?  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:40:40):**  But interdependent again.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:40:42):**  Yes. So we are nature and we are of nature.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:40:46):**  So we are that, we are the, what you see now is that little product of what's going on around us  
**[0:40:56-0:40:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:40:56):**  and what's going on within us.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:40:58):**  We're seeing, depending on what tribe you're following on Instagram,  
**[0:41:03-0:41:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:03):**  but things like your thoughts become your reality.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:07):**  That's quite powerful stuff.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:08):**  If you said that to me 20 years ago, it would have gone right over my head.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:12):**  But then you start to see it. Yeah. How I think, how I see the world.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:16):**  It directly affects how people interact with me that day.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:19):**  One of my favourite sayings is, you know, if someone's a dick to you, whatever, breathe it off.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:27):**  If everyone's a dick to you, you're the dick.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:30):**  And that's really powerful, because if you are having a shitty day and you're wearing it on your face,  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:34):**  people are going to be, have a perception, isn't it?  
**[0:41:38-0:41:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:38):**  Yeah. Yeah.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:40):**  It's perception. So morning rituals, are you into your morning rituals?  
**[0:41:42-0:41:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:42):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:43):**  Well, you must go on to jazzing in, say morning rituals.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:45):**  As a vater, I need the routine, but I also can't be there the whole time.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:50):**  So last night was a good example, Hemsley & Hemsley's Sapper Club.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:54):**  I ate a lot later and a lot heavier than I normally would.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:41:57):**  So I slept in this morning and to seven o'clock.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:01):**  Normally I'm up about 5.30, six.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:04):**  Five, 10 years ago, I was not a morning person.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:07):**  Now I realise I'm cashing in on that energy of the day.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:09):**  So for me, waking up as early as possible, having had a good night's sleep,  
**[0:42:13-0:42:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:13):**  is when I feel my most energised.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:15):**  I get to do a bit of movement.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:18):**  I clean my tongue always, first thing.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:20):**  I shower first thing.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:22):**  Scrape.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:23):**  Tongue scrape, yeah.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:24):**  It's a tongue scraper.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:25):**  I like when jazz means tongue scrapers.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:26):**  A little copper tongue scrape, you can find it on the website.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:28):**  What's it called again?  
**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:30):**  I call it tongue tingler.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:31):**  Tongue tingler.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:32):**  Only because I kind of thought tongue scraping sounded a bit awful,  
**[0:42:35-0:42:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:35):**  but then as soon as I kind of printed tongue tingler in the bags  
**[0:42:39-0:42:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:39):**  and called it tongue tingler, I Googled tongue tingler.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:41):**  OK, let's not go there.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:42):**  Yeah, it's dodge.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:44):**  So, yeah, cleaning my tongue is something that my meditation teacher,  
**[0:42:47-0:42:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:47):**  Gary Goro, taught me exactly 10 years ago and totally changed my life.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:52):**  Having that relationship with your tongue is like a little window to what's going on.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:42:57):**  I can see if my food or my lifestyle choices the last few days  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:02):**  have been good for me or not, depending on what's on my tongue.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:05):**  Isn't that nuts?  
**[0:43:06-0:43:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:06):**  Or the shape of my tongue or the colour of my tongue.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:10):**  Again, obvious, isn't it?  
**[0:43:11-0:43:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:11):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:13):**  And people you know about traditional Chinese medicine,  
**[0:43:16-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:16):**  that's a very important part, and also in Ayurveda.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:18):**  But now I'm seeing a lot of practitioners say poke your tongue out  
**[0:43:21-0:43:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:21):**  because you can see there, as well as the eyes, as well as the skin,  
**[0:43:24-0:43:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:24):**  as well as the shape of the face, as well as how you're holding your shoulders,  
**[0:43:28-0:43:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:28):**  we are just one big walking box of information  
**[0:43:31-0:43:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:31):**  and it's how someone reads it.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:33):**  Interprets it.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:34):**  Interprets it, absolutely.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:35):**  So I get up, I clean my tongue, I oil pull in the shower.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:40):**  Right, explain oil pulling.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:42):**  Oil pulling is, so it's actually easier sometimes talking to women who grew up when I did,  
**[0:43:47-0:43:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:47):**  when back in the day you would strip your face to cleanse it with all these things.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:51):**  It took off all the oil.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:52):**  Oil was bad, fat was bad, do you remember?  
**[0:43:54-0:43:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:54):**  Fat was bad for the arteries.  
**[0:43:56-0:43:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:56):**  We're going to dry you out.  
**[0:43:57-0:43:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:57):**  We're going to dry you out, exactly. No oil allowed.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:43:59):**  It crisped your skin up.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:00):**  Exactly.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:01):**  And then you want to apply more of this.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:02):**  Yes, and then you can buy more of that product over there.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:04):**  Yeah, all that moisture I guess.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:05):**  And now we're realising that oil is actually the most nourishing way to restore  
**[0:44:10-0:44:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:10):**  and to remove dirt and toxins.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:12):**  So in the same way that oil cleansing the face has become very popular  
**[0:44:16-0:44:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:16):**  and oiling the body with a massage,  
**[0:44:18-0:44:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:18):**  oiling the mouth is a really good way of, you know, oil draws things out  
**[0:44:26-0:44:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:26):**  and also gets sucked into nourish.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:29):**  So you're kind of nourishing the mouth and pulling out the toxins  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:33):**  that have kind of maybe making their way to the surface after a good night's sleep.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:38):**  So it's a great way instead of using those harsh mouth washes,  
**[0:44:43-0:44:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:43):**  which I wouldn't recommend because…  
**[0:44:45-0:44:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:45):**  No, they strip the pH balance.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:46):**  Exactly.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:47):**  And there's a microbiome in our mouth that's directly related to our gut microbiome.  
**[0:44:53-0:45:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:44:53):**  And so when you're wiping out your mouth with these harsh mouth washes that feel fresh and zingy,  
**[0:45:01-0:45:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:01):**  because that's what we're led to believe, if my tongue's burning that's a good thing.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:04):**  No, gosh, you just wiped out a whole load of good bacteria.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:08):**  So yeah, oiling…  
**[0:45:09-0:45:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:09):**  What kind of oil would you recommend?  
**[0:45:11-0:45:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:11):**  So traditional oil would be a pure sesame oil.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:16):**  They call it ripened so it's not so unprocessed that it could go rancid on you.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:22):**  It's just stabilised and you will then draw that in and around your mouth,  
**[0:45:26-0:45:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:26):**  working your jaw muscles, so very good for the face,  
**[0:45:29-0:45:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:29):**  and you'll pull that in and out of your teeth.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:31):**  And people just have lift stains, it nourishes into the gums, it pulls,  
**[0:45:37-0:45:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:37):**  bad bacteria gets a chance to get washed out that way and then you spit it out of the toilet.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:42):**  So try and do that for up to 20 minutes.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:44):**  Wow.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:45):**  Yes.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:46):**  As long as that.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:48):**  Damn, I've been cutting that a bit short.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:49):**  But anything is good.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:50):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:51):**  Anything is good as long as you're going in that direction and tension is everything.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:55):**  So I learnt if I do it in the shower and then as I finish showering and I put oil on my  
**[0:45:59-0:46:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:45:59):**  body and put the kettle on, I'm still doing it.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:02):**  And then definitely spit it down the toilet guys, not down the other.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:04):**  And isn't it just used to not having conversation like that for 20 minutes?  
**[0:46:07-0:46:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:07):**  Yeah, we don't.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:08):**  Sometimes we talk and we're real talky.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:09):**  Brilliant.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:10):**  We wind each other up.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:11):**  That made you get podcast.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:13):**  Very much wind each other up.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:14):**  But I don't, oh sorry, I don't do it every day because some days it's just not part  
**[0:46:20-0:46:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:20):**  of, I'm not feeling it.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:21):**  What tongue scraping I do.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:23):**  Then I go downstairs and I'll start sipping hot water and I'll do some movement.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:30):**  So having this time also helps me get a little poo on the brew going.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:35):**  So it's a nice time to then have a little dump.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:39):**  And that is very important.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:40):**  A bowel movement going.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:41):**  A bowel movement, yeah.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:42):**  Because if I, you know, let's talk about how I used to wake up.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:45):**  I used to wake up, I used to eke out that every minute that I could out of my sleep  
**[0:46:49-0:46:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:49):**  because I go to bed too late.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:50):**  So I'd wake up to a blaring alarm.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:52):**  My body would be like, right, Jasmine, you've got this another day.  
**[0:46:55-0:46:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:55):**  Get on with it.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:56):**  Jump out of bed.  
**[0:46:57-0:46:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:57):**  Oh, no, a couple of more minutes, couple of minutes.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:46:58):**  So you're playing with yourself there.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:00):**  Then you, then you finally get up and jump in the shower, smash down a coffee straight  
**[0:47:05-0:47:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:05):**  out the door.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:06):**  No time for bowel movement.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:07):**  Completely upregulated.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:08):**  Upregulated.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:09):**  And then my body just hold onto that bowel movement.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:11):**  Probably, you know, 80% of the time for the rest of the day.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:14):**  And even overnight again until I get a moment the next morning.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:17):**  And you feel relaxed.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:18):**  And then you feel relaxed.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:20):**  So for me having that time to just do all that and it only takes half an hour.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:23):**  I mean, I do 10 minutes of movement, 10 to 15 minutes of meditation.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:27):**  I sit my hot water and that's done.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:29):**  So I'm adding on an extra half an hour on my day.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:31):**  Even if someone's listening and they realize that what Jasmine's saying, that even if you  
**[0:47:34-0:47:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:34):**  pulled half an hour back in the evening, you gain that half an hour in the morning.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:38):**  And it's to start the day with the right intention.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:41):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:42):**  So you're not walking out the house completely frantic.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:44):**  Exactly.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:45):**  Stressed out.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:46):**  Minus the bowel movement.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:47):**  Yes.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:48):**  On edge.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:49):**  Yes.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:50):**  Which is that exact same sensation that comes in with that alarm clock originally, right?  
**[0:47:52-0:47:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:52):**  And you know, people listening to this, especially young people who don't, who are like, oh, I  
**[0:47:56-0:47:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:56):**  don't really have that.  
**[0:47:57-0:47:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:57):**  I'm not anxious.  
**[0:47:58-0:47:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:58):**  I'm not on edge.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:47:59):**  Any kind of heightened feeling is exhausting.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:03):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:04):**  So, you know, think about kids at a birthday party having the time of their life.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:08):**  By the end, they are smashed.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:10):**  They're overtired.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:11):**  They're irritable.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:12):**  Overstimulated.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:13):**  Overstimulated.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:14):**  And it goes out of control.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:16):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:17):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:18):**  We had an overstimulated Tallulah last night because we moved again, right?  
**[0:48:20-0:48:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:20):**  So for her it was loads of change.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:22):**  Yeah, she had discombobulated.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:23):**  Totally out of a rhythm.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:24):**  And she was off her head all night, which means we're all off her head, you know?  
**[0:48:29-0:48:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:29):**  And yet they don't have kind of the, they haven't managed the tools yet.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:37):**  So you really get to see the emotion of it, of what it truly is.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:41):**  You know, they haven't dumbed down that.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:44):**  And that's that conversation.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:45):**  And there's people out there going, no, no, I'm not stressed.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:47):**  I'm not stressed.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:48):**  I'm fine.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:49):**  I don't have anxiety.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:50):**  So I have friends in their 20s, late 20s now, and two of them are pitters.  
**[0:48:56-0:48:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:56):**  And they're very much the same.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:48:58):**  They're organized on it.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:01):**  They're hammering it at some hit class, one minute.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:05):**  They're drinking their green smoothies and in yoga the next.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:07):**  They're partying, but they're brilliant at work.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:10):**  You know, they're just the kind of person you want to employ.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:13):**  And one of them texted me the other day, she had to check herself into hospital with heart  
**[0:49:17-0:49:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:17):**  palpitations.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:18):**  Absolutely terrified.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:19):**  Yeah, and it's terrifying because I remember it was probably 10 years ago and burnout started,  
**[0:49:23-0:49:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:23):**  I started to hear it with people in their 30s.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:26):**  And now we are, we're getting people in their 20s of burnout.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:29):**  I mean, that's really highlighting something, isn't it?  
**[0:49:31-0:49:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:31):**  Yes, definitely.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:32):**  In terms of sustainability, that is not sustainable.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:35):**  No.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:36):**  You can't sustain your energy if you are always in this yang, you know, using a Chinese term  
**[0:49:41-0:49:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:41):**  here, this yang way of doing, you know, always doing.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:45):**  So yang think of it as the masculine energy.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:47):**  It's the energy of being productive.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:49):**  It's something that we massively applaud here in the West because it means you're getting  
**[0:49:53-0:49:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:53):**  something done, you know, earning money, successful, or you're out there getting on with it.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:49:57):**  But if you don't balance that with the yin, the feminine energy, the calm and grounding,  
**[0:50:02-0:50:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:02):**  cooling energy, you know, yang is hot energy.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:05):**  You will literally burn out.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:07):**  That's where that term comes from.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:08):**  And it's such an important conversation because, you know, I mentioned this a lot in most podcasts  
**[0:50:12-0:50:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:12):**  where I'm discussing this Peter Carnes term because I just bloody love it.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:16):**  And it's called this environmental generational amnesia, right?  
**[0:50:19-0:50:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:19):**  Every generation that comes along, they're born into their new normal.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:23):**  So I have a lawyer, Lawrence, who's 72.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:27):**  Sorry, I forgot that wrong.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:28):**  I think you're 72.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:30):**  We discussed his role as a lawyer when he first started.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:33):**  So he would write a letter, right?  
**[0:50:36-0:50:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:36):**  He'd have seven days and he'd get a response from that letter.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:40):**  They do their diligence, right?  
**[0:50:41-0:50:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:41):**  So everything would be just so research, every little detail in there.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:46):**  They know, oh my God, we'd have to write this whole thing out again.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:49):**  We'd have to deal with seven days.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:52):**  This is handwritten.  
**[0:50:53-0:50:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:53):**  Right, handwritten.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:54):**  So they'd have all this time and then the fax machine came.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:50:58):**  And then it became like three days to a day response.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:03):**  Then he said the internet came and then to start with, a little bit slow,  
**[0:51:07-0:51:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:07):**  and then the mobile phone with the internet came.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:11):**  And then he said it's just literally,  
**[0:51:12-0:51:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:12):**  but people aren't even doing the job properly anymore  
**[0:51:14-0:51:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:14):**  like they did when it was pen and paper.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:16):**  It's now he might have to deal with ten emails about that one thing,  
**[0:51:21-0:51:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:21):**  that that would have been dealt with with one letter previously.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:24):**  So we think we're simplifying things,  
**[0:51:26-0:51:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:26):**  but we've actually ramped things up with that model.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:28):**  And so if that's your new norm, that's what you're born into,  
**[0:51:32-0:51:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:32):**  you don't even recognise the length of time that Lawrence had all those years ago.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:36):**  So they had rest, right?  
**[0:51:39-0:51:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:39):**  They had periods of rest.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:40):**  I remember my dad always saying, oh, shut my eyes.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:42):**  I'm just resting my eyes.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:43):**  And that was like meditation, right?  
**[0:51:45-0:51:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:45):**  So we need these tools now, right?  
**[0:51:47-0:51:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:47):**  The 20s and the 30s.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:49):**  Generation Z or Z generation?  
**[0:51:51-0:51:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:51):**  Gen Z.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:52):**  Gen Z.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:53):**  It sounds like zombies.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:55):**  You should see their thumbs move when they're texting,  
**[0:51:57-0:52:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:51:57):**  but they are also born not only into this world of technology,  
**[0:52:03-0:52:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:03):**  they're also born into a world where we are talking about wellbeing.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:07):**  So they're almost getting the two extremes here.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:09):**  Yeah, it's a polarity, right?  
**[0:52:10-0:52:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:10):**  Yes.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:11):**  And if you look now, yoga went very acrobatic,  
**[0:52:15-0:52:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:15):**  rocket, bikram standing on your head.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:18):**  But now we're seeing the rise of hatha, yin, relaxation.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:21):**  Yeah, the yin factors are coming through.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:22):**  Yes, I do sound baths.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:23):**  People come and pay money to lie down and have a snooze.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:26):**  Yes, you have sounds about it.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:27):**  I've been to that.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:28):**  I thought it was fantastic.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:30):**  And that's, you know, we're having to schedule that in  
**[0:52:34-0:52:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:34):**  because society is not allowing us to live the biological norm,  
**[0:52:39-0:52:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:39):**  as you call it.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:40):**  So if you are surrounded by, for example,  
**[0:52:43-0:52:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:43):**  if you went to France where everyone apparently takes an hour for lunch,  
**[0:52:47-0:52:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:47):**  that becomes your new norm.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:48):**  You come back to London and you're like,  
**[0:52:50-0:52:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:50):**  oh my God, I've got indigestion.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:52):**  Or I didn't get to eat today.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:54):**  And it becomes a badge of honor.  
**[0:52:55-0:52:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:55):**  I didn't eat.  
**[0:52:56-0:52:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:56):**  I didn't sleep.  
**[0:52:57-0:52:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:57):**  I'm stressed.  
**[0:52:58-0:52:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:58):**  And you can make that adaptation in a matter of weeks, right?  
**[0:52:59-0:53:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:52:59):**  Yes.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:00):**  But then again, if you're in a new company  
**[0:53:02-0:53:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:02):**  and people give you a snide look because you left your desk  
**[0:53:06-0:53:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:06):**  or you were gone for half an hour, you know,  
**[0:53:08-0:53:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:08):**  you're going to feel very uncomfortable and I can understand that.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:11):**  So what we're doing effectively is bit by bit,  
**[0:53:15-0:53:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:15):**  we are beginning to tell society that this is the way that we want to do things.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:19):**  You know, and you watch now and big companies are bringing in gurus  
**[0:53:24-0:53:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:24):**  or advisors or wellbeing experts to because they realize you've got to get  
**[0:53:28-0:53:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:28):**  so much more out of your employees if you, A, show them the love  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:33):**  and B, allow them to recuperate because otherwise they're going to burn out  
**[0:53:37-0:53:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:37):**  and you've got to replace them.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:39):**  And who are you going to replace them with?  
**[0:53:40-0:53:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:40):**  Yeah, another one.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:41):**  Another burn out.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:42):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:44):**  So what I love is that yang is that masculine hot energy  
**[0:53:48-0:53:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:48):**  and what's the phrase we use for too much yang?  
**[0:53:50-0:53:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:50):**  Burn out, you know.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:53):**  And that is what I have A, it talks about, you know,  
**[0:53:56-0:53:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:56):**  when we say things like, oh, man, I feel spaced out  
**[0:53:59-0:54:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:53:59):**  or my heart's been very heavy.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:01):**  Like me earlier, when we first met.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:04):**  I was tripping out.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:05):**  You were drooling.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:06):**  You were like, when I was at me, when I was gone somewhere else, you know.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:10):**  Yeah, because your body's trying to find homeostasis, you know,  
**[0:54:15-0:54:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:15):**  you're doing something quite extreme  
**[0:54:18-0:54:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:18):**  and your body's trying to make sense of it the whole time.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:20):**  So that rest is really important as you're seeing today.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:23):**  You said day four, you were on top of it.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:25):**  You were telling everyone I found I'm being the progress.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:28):**  I am the progress.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:29):**  I am the process.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:30):**  I have become it.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:31):**  The process, sorry.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:32):**  And then Toluda wiped my sleep out.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:35):**  Had a bit of this, Dad.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:36):**  Let's see how you do today.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:37):**  And then I missed the recovery.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:38):**  Yeah, and you really feel it.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:40):**  I mean, you know, Tony, who is the most nimble thing I've ever met,  
**[0:54:46-0:54:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:46):**  you know, it took 10 minutes to make his nest in this,  
**[0:54:48-0:54:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:48):**  on this chair because he's aching and, you know,  
**[0:54:51-0:54:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:51):**  the lactic acid's building up and...  
**[0:54:53-0:54:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:53):**  It's an incredible process.  
**[0:54:54-0:54:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:54):**  So getting to know yourself in that way is beautiful.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:54:58):**  It stops being that judgmental, oh, I'm an old man, oh, I've broken this,  
**[0:55:02-0:55:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:02):**  oh, this isn't going to work anymore, so sod it, you know.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:05):**  It's actually, oh, look at that, look how things add up and become this.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:09):**  And now I just need to take some things away to become that.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:12):**  And it just becomes this really wonderful, fluid collection deposit,  
**[0:55:16-0:55:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:16):**  deposit collection, gather, let go, you know, easy in, easy out.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:22):**  Flow.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:23):**  Flow.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:24):**  So of course you have a book, don't you, East by West?  
**[0:55:28-0:55:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:28):**  I do, I have a book.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:29):**  Which is fantastic.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:30):**  Yeah, East by West.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:31):**  So it's a really nice entry level, isn't it?  
**[0:55:32-0:55:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:32):**  Yes.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:33):**  It's just, it's opening up the door so that yet you can become that process, I guess.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:41):**  Understand the balance.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:42):**  Take from it what you want, that's the beauty of it.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:44):**  You know, it's not an exclusive club, it's not some kind of diet where you have to follow the rules.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:48):**  It is the manual of living.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:49):**  So if you just decide, do you know what, I really resonate with this idea of going to bed a bit earlier.  
**[0:55:54-0:55:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:54):**  I'm going to try it.  
**[0:55:55-0:55:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:55):**  Brilliant.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:55:56):**  You know, just being able to go to bed, even you're asleep, just ensuring that you're resting at the right time of the day,  
**[0:56:03-0:56:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:03):**  and there is a right time, and we're seeing that with shift working, etc.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:07):**  Something has just popped up.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:08):**  What about with kids?  
**[0:56:10-0:56:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:10):**  Yeah, what do you do?  
**[0:56:11-0:56:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:11):**  I mean, you know, because I guess as you get older, you can kind of, you can work out for yourself almost.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:18):**  And how do you identify it within your kids?  
**[0:56:20-0:56:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:20):**  As in the doshas?  
**[0:56:21-0:56:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:21):**  As in the doshas.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:22):**  Have you got a book for that?  
**[0:56:23-0:56:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:23):**  No, no.  
**[0:56:25-0:56:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:25):**  I'm just thinking because it's a great one, isn't it?  
**[0:56:27-0:56:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:27):**  Because a great tool, I think it's so important with children, you get that right.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:32):**  Imagine you had all your kids in balance the whole time.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:34):**  It's very much alike.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:36):**  So for example, Naomi who works with me, we always laugh about this, she's very pitter.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:40):**  So she's in a summer dress, as is my sister, for most of the year.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:44):**  And you know, we don't live in a hot country, they're in summer dresses most of the year,  
**[0:56:47-0:56:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:47):**  and they might put her on a jacket when it rains.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:49):**  So, and if I ever travel with Naomi, I'm in layers, because I need to adjust my temperature,  
**[0:56:55-0:56:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:55):**  she's in this dress with a denim jacket perhaps.  
**[0:56:57-0:56:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:57):**  And you're sitting really close to her.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:56:58):**  I'm sitting close to her, she's like, you're too hot, move away from me.  
**[0:57:01-0:57:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:01):**  She likes drier food, you know, because she's already got the water element in her.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:06):**  I don't have the water element as much, so I look for soups and stews.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:10):**  Yet when she gets sick, she looks for the soups and stews.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:13):**  And then, you know, I love a good crackle French every now and again.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:18):**  So you can really see how those play out.  
**[0:57:20-0:57:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:20):**  But remember, you don't have to kind of totally identify your children.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:23):**  It just becomes, you know, what I love about Ayurveda is, every time you cook a recipe  
**[0:57:27-0:57:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:27):**  with an Ayurveda contention or with a philosophy, every time you kind of read a bit,  
**[0:57:32-0:57:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:32):**  you understand that bit more, but you don't have to suddenly figure things out, so to speak.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:36):**  So you just recognize, oh gosh, one of my kids has got a bit more of a temper than the other one.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:40):**  That's the bitter.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:41):**  But it would be wonders at mealtime, right?  
**[0:57:44-0:57:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:45):**  You know, when people go through this process of thinking, oh, we've got to wean the kids,  
**[0:57:48-0:57:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:48):**  which I hate that process, because really just, they wean themselves, just put food out.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:53):**  And they automatically will go for what they like.  
**[0:57:55-0:57:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:55):**  Yes, rather than being this strict, oh, your child hasn't developed this skill yet.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:57:59):**  Yeah, let's mash the food up and let's make them eat it.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:58:01):**  Well, I don't want to eat that right now, so I'll spit it out.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:58:03):**  No, you must have it and keep putting it in.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:58:06):**  I mean, it'd be a great process, that.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:58:08):**  I wonder if the parent could become skilled at just even that, seeing what it is they're picking up.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:58:14):**  Yes, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:58:16):**  And then there are some just some basic kind of guidelines in Ayurveda as well.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:58:20):**  So we talked about the eating earlier, eating lighter before bed and going to bed at the right time.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:58:26):**  So, you know, different organs heal at different times of the night.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:58:31):**  And that's why between 10 and six are the most important times to get rest, whether you're just lying there wide awake,  
**[0:58:40-0:58:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:58:40):**  you know, just being horizontal, talking yourself into a dark space in a dark space is very, very, very important.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:58:46):**  And you want to be horizontal for at least five hours.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:58:49):**  Things like getting up in the morning and showering before you meditate, before you do yoga.  
**[0:58:56-0:58:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:58:56):**  And people are like, why do you shower before yoga?  
**[0:58:58-0:59:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:58:58):**  One, I don't do hot, sweaty yoga.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:59:01):**  And two, you're cultivating a cheer of prana in your body and it comes out and your skin, it's all around you.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:59:07):**  You don't want to wash it off.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:59:08):**  So wash the night off because that's what you've been doing, a lot of kind of working through things.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:59:13):**  Start the day fresh. You feel fresh.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:59:15):**  My mom's favorite thing whenever I was feeling down or upset or sick was go wash your hair, you know, go and go and have a shower.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:59:22):**  Because you just feel a bit more together, clean, you know.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:59:27):**  Other things, main meal of the day, lunchtime.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:59:30):**  This works for most people.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:59:32):**  It could be the first meal of the day.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:59:34):**  If you're a kaffir, you might not necessarily need to eat breakfast.  
**[0:59:37-0:59:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:59:37):**  But for other people, it might be your second meal.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:59:39):**  This should be the biggest meal because your digestive fire, the agni in your stomach, follows the agni, which is the sun.  
**[0:59:46-0:59:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:59:46):**  So when you wake up in the morning, your fire isn't fully up and running.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:59:49):**  So to put on a massive breakfast is actually like sticking a huge log onto a fire that's getting going.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=0:59:57):**  And to most people listening now, come on, Jaz, what's the agni?  
**[1:00:00-1:00:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:00):**  Agni is fire.  
**[1:00:01-1:00:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:01):**  Agni on.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:02):**  Agni on. Yeah, agni means fire in Sanskrit.  
**[1:00:05-1:00:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:05):**  And so if we're talking about the fire in us, you can say the fire, you know, the heat, think of the acid in your stomach.  
**[1:00:13-1:00:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:13):**  You know, the stomach transforms food, which is essentially poison, until it's been transformed into this beautiful vital juice, if you like, that we use to feed our mind, body and spirit.  
**[1:00:28-1:00:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:28):**  If you think about it, you're not going to flatline an avocado.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:30):**  Is that the right word, flatline?  
**[1:00:32-1:00:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:32):**  No, you're not going to inject an avocado into your veins, right?  
**[1:00:34-1:00:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:34):**  No, into your main vein.  
**[1:00:35-1:00:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:35):**  Into your main vein?  
**[1:00:36-1:00:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:36):**  Yeah.  
**[1:00:37-1:00:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:37):**  It's totally toxic, right?  
**[1:00:38-1:00:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:38):**  Yeah.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:39):**  You're not going to put chlorella straight in there.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:41):**  You're not going to put baobab straight in there.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:43):**  No.  
**[1:00:44-1:00:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:44):**  You're...  
**[1:00:45-1:00:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:45):**  I might try and snort matcha in the morning at the moment.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:48):**  But your stomach has to transform it.  
**[1:00:51-1:00:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:51):**  So that's the fire.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:52):**  That's the change.  
**[1:00:53-1:00:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:53):**  That's the combustion.  
**[1:00:55-1:00:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:55):**  That's the metabolism.  
**[1:00:56-1:00:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:56):**  And so that's why they call it agni.  
**[1:00:58-1:01:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:00:58):**  So the most important thing to understand in Ayurveda is how is your digestion?  
**[1:01:02-1:01:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:02):**  And what's happening in the wellbeing world at the moment?  
**[1:01:05-1:01:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:05):**  All about digestion.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:06):**  All about digestion.  
**[1:01:08-1:01:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:08):**  The East has been talking about it for thousands of years.  
**[1:01:11-1:01:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:11):**  We, the West, with all that science, it's like we've just discovered there's a gut.  
**[1:01:15-1:01:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:15):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:01:16-1:01:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:16):**  And there's a gut brain.  
**[1:01:17-1:01:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:17):**  And there's a gut brain.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:18):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:01:19-1:01:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:19):**  And there's a heart brain.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:20):**  Exactly.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:21):**  So while I love what we're doing in science, it doesn't tell you the whole picture.  
**[1:01:24-1:01:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:24):**  The whole picture already exists.  
**[1:01:25-1:01:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:25):**  No, because there's reductionism within it, right?  
**[1:01:27-1:01:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:27):**  Yes.  
**[1:01:28-1:01:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:28):**  And finally, we got the reductionism into the microbiome of the gut, which is then,  
**[1:01:31-1:01:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:31):**  ah, okay, this is a bigger, this is an organism.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:34):**  But rather than sit there and try and calculate exactly what you're putting into the gut,  
**[1:01:38-1:01:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:38):**  and have you got the right amount of prebiotics and probiotics, etc., etc., more think how  
**[1:01:43-1:01:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:43):**  digestible is this food, and how, how, at what capacity is my agni working right now?  
**[1:01:49-1:01:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:49):**  Yeah, how am I simulating with the food?  
**[1:01:51-1:01:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:51):**  So my agni is low because I, I've got indigestion because I'm tired, because I'm stressed, because  
**[1:01:59-1:02:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:01:59):**  I'm angry, because I've just woken up.  
**[1:02:02-1:02:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:02):**  If I go and take the most incredibly nutritious, organic, biodynamic meal and dump it in there  
**[1:02:08-1:02:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:08):**  without chewing, and without being present, I'm going to cause myself a bit of a disaster.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:13):**  That food is not going to become that incredible nectar juice that we assume it is because  
**[1:02:18-1:02:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:18):**  it's made up of loads of great plant foods.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:20):**  Do you see what I mean?  
**[1:02:22-1:02:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:22):**  Yeah, yeah, I mean, you can, I mean, you can just throw out the pH balance alone, right?  
**[1:02:26-1:02:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:26):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:02:27-1:02:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:27):**  You're just, you're basically putting a big undigestible log onto a low burning fire,  
**[1:02:34-1:02:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:34):**  and it's going to smoulder, and it's going to putrify, and it's not going to burn cleanly.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:39):**  But if your fire is up and it's roaring, you've just hiked.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:43):**  Tony, you just said just this morning, I could, if I could eat through my ears, Jaz, you know,  
**[1:02:48-1:02:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:48):**  he is a burning furnace.  
**[1:02:49-1:02:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:49):**  I was one of these again, one of these.  
**[1:02:50-1:02:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:50):**  These are ladoos.  
**[1:02:51-1:02:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:51):**  Ladoos.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:52):**  He's a burning furnace that just needs fueling.  
**[1:02:56-1:03:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:02:56):**  So you could eat what we might call in that, yeah, he's munching away and chew properly,  
**[1:03:01-1:03:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:01):**  don't rush it.  
**[1:03:02-1:03:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:02):**  He might, his fire is burning so brightly that if I gave you what we might consider  
**[1:03:10-1:03:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:10):**  as the most unnutritious junk food plate right now, your body would still make great work of it.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:17):**  Your fire is on, it's going to burn through it, you know, and that's the difference.  
**[1:03:21-1:03:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:21):**  That's why you might be on holiday, super relaxed, having a great time.  
**[1:03:25-1:03:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:25):**  Like, why is this bread, cheese and wine going down so well?  
**[1:03:29-1:03:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:29):**  Because you're relaxed, your fire's working, you ate when you were hungry, you slept,  
**[1:03:33-1:03:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:33):**  you took a nap in the afternoon because you were tired, you know, you had time to have a glass of water  
**[1:03:38-1:03:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:38):**  because you said, oh, I'm thirsty.  
**[1:03:40-1:03:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:40):**  Sounds wonderful.  
**[1:03:41-1:03:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:41):**  You had a relaxing pee.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:42):**  How many of us go to the toilet?  
**[1:03:44-1:03:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:44):**  This is a really good one.  
**[1:03:45-1:03:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:45):**  I knew I was, I knew, you know, I had to sort myself out when I used to literally push my pee through  
**[1:03:49-1:03:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:49):**  because I didn't have time.  
**[1:03:51-1:03:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:51):**  I'm the complete opposite on the runs because I nearly wet myself.  
**[1:03:54-1:03:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:54):**  Two times.  
**[1:03:55-1:04:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:03:55):**  I'm like, oh my God, oh my God, I'm nearly weeding.  
**[1:04:00-1:04:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:00):**  And you did say.  
**[1:04:01-1:04:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:01):**  Sometimes I'm in the middle of a village, it's just not that easy.  
**[1:04:05-1:04:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:05):**  I do remember when you first asked me to do this, the last time I did a 5K run was a group park run  
**[1:04:11-1:04:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:11):**  and it was in Killerton in Devon and everyone kind of took off and the pitter in me,  
**[1:04:17-1:04:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:17):**  the competitive side, I used to run for my school, kind of was like, oh, why am I 10 people back?  
**[1:04:22-1:04:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:22):**  I want to be at the front. I'm going to do this.  
**[1:04:25-1:04:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:25):**  And the adrenaline just took it out of me.  
**[1:04:27-1:04:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:27):**  I thought I was going to crap myself and pee myself.  
**[1:04:30-1:04:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:30):**  It was exhausting.  
**[1:04:32-1:04:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:32):**  And I actually turned to lead before I even got halfway through.  
**[1:04:35-1:04:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:35):**  It was like my legs were so heavy after that.  
**[1:04:38-1:04:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:38):**  It was a nightmare.  
**[1:04:39-1:04:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:39):**  You got any images from that?  
**[1:04:40-1:04:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:40):**  We can put them in, we can put them up.  
**[1:04:42-1:04:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:42):**  I'd love to see those.  
**[1:04:43-1:04:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:43):**  Nick said I looked like death as I came over.  
**[1:04:45-1:04:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:45):**  But the worst bit was that I just kept ahead of this one guy and girl  
**[1:04:49-1:04:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:49):**  and just at the last couple of metres, they just went past me and I was...  
**[1:04:53-1:04:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:53):**  It happened.  
**[1:04:54-1:04:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:54):**  Oh.  
**[1:04:55-1:04:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:55):**  But yeah, your body is just trying to lose.  
**[1:04:58-1:05:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:04:58):**  It's so focused on what it's doing, it just wants to dump anything that's getting in its way.  
**[1:05:02-1:05:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:02):**  And dumping, we talk about poos, we talk about poos a lot,  
**[1:05:06-1:05:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:06):**  but you want to be able to dump it when it's ready to be dumped.  
**[1:05:09-1:05:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:09):**  Yeah, don't hold on to it.  
**[1:05:10-1:05:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:10):**  Don't hold on to that stuff.  
**[1:05:12-1:05:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:12):**  And that's all of life.  
**[1:05:14-1:05:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:14):**  They also don't push stuff.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:16):**  We talk about the squat, don't we?  
**[1:05:17-1:05:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:17):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:18):**  We were in that video, didn't we?  
**[1:05:19-1:05:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:19):**  Remember when Sally Petruz was in one beat and Jazz ripped her pants?  
**[1:05:24-1:05:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:24):**  My jeans, not my knickers.  
**[1:05:26-1:05:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:26):**  Her jeans, not her pants.  
**[1:05:27-1:05:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:27):**  I was being cool.  
**[1:05:29-1:05:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:29):**  We were showing off and I was like, Tony, just ripped my new jeans.  
**[1:05:34-1:05:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:34):**  It was like a...  
**[1:05:35-1:05:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:35):**  But that was talking about pooping.  
**[1:05:37-1:05:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:37):**  Yes.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:38):**  Squatting and pooping.  
**[1:05:39-1:05:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:39):**  The all important position.  
**[1:05:41-1:05:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:41):**  It was, oh gosh, 15 years ago, there was a girl, a friend of mine, she's from Australia,  
**[1:05:48-1:05:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:48):**  and she was very much into this animalistic movement.  
**[1:05:52-1:05:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:52):**  She'd come and stay with me part of the time in the year.  
**[1:05:56-1:06:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:05:56):**  And I used to see shoe marks on my Lou.  
**[1:06:00-1:06:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:00):**  I was like, Britt, what are you doing?  
**[1:06:02-1:06:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:02):**  She said, oh, I'm squatting on the Lou.  
**[1:06:04-1:06:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:04):**  That's a really bad accent.  
**[1:06:05-1:06:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:05):**  Can you do that again?  
**[1:06:06-1:06:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:06):**  Oh, I'm having a squat on the Lou.  
**[1:06:07-1:06:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:07):**  That's good, that's good.  
**[1:06:10-1:06:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:10):**  I said, why?  
**[1:06:11-1:06:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:11):**  She said, well, it's much better if you think about it.  
**[1:06:13-1:06:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:13):**  You're all in alignment.  
**[1:06:14-1:06:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:14):**  You're not putting any strain.  
**[1:06:15-1:06:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:15):**  Gravity takes...  
**[1:06:16-1:06:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:16):**  I was like, oh, because I wasn't pooing that well, I have to say, 15 years ago.  
**[1:06:21-1:06:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:21):**  And I took it on board and it's brilliant.  
**[1:06:23-1:06:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:23):**  And now I've got a little kid's stool.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:25):**  Yeah, or just hit the squatty potty.  
**[1:06:28-1:06:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:28):**  I'll hit the squatty potty.  
**[1:06:29-1:06:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:29):**  Brilliant.  
**[1:06:30-1:06:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:30):**  But I have utilized the squatting on a Lou seat on times when I've travelled and I'm  
**[1:06:37-1:06:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:37):**  not feeling like I'm, you know, I need to go, but it's not properly coming or it's  
**[1:06:42-1:06:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:42):**  not feeling like a full evacuation.  
**[1:06:44-1:06:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:44):**  Yeah.  
**[1:06:45-1:06:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:45):**  And also we can use that as a signal, can't we?  
**[1:06:47-1:06:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:47):**  Yeah.  
**[1:06:48-1:06:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:48):**  So you can use the poop.  
**[1:06:49-1:06:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:49):**  Yes, yes, yes.  
**[1:06:50-1:06:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:50):**  Now I know I'm stressed.  
**[1:06:51-1:06:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:51):**  Now I know I'm not regulated.  
**[1:06:52-1:06:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:52):**  Now I know this because I'm not...  
**[1:06:53-1:06:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:53):**  Would you like the dochek breakdown of your poop?  
**[1:06:55-1:06:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:55):**  Go on.  
**[1:06:56-1:06:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:56):**  Okay, so when Vata is aggravated...  
**[1:06:58-1:06:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:58):**  This is great.  
**[1:06:59-1:07:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:06:59):**  You'll get rabbit pellets.  
**[1:07:00-1:07:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:00):**  Okay.  
**[1:07:01-1:07:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:01):**  You know, the deer poops.  
**[1:07:02-1:07:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:02):**  Have you ever had those?  
**[1:07:03-1:07:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:03):**  I don't think you have because you're a pitta, haven't you?  
**[1:07:04-1:07:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:04):**  No, no, no.  
**[1:07:05-1:07:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:05):**  Okay, so I'm going to tell you the next.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:06):**  So Vata will have a dryer.  
**[1:07:08-1:07:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:08):**  Remember they're airy, dry, light, erratic.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:11):**  So you'll get little rabbit pellet pops, you know.  
**[1:07:14-1:07:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:14):**  The pitta when it's aggravated, and I think you're going to recognise this one, you get  
**[1:07:18-1:07:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:18):**  the runs.  
**[1:07:19-1:07:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:19):**  You get hot liquid.  
**[1:07:20-1:07:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:20):**  Remember, pitta is hot liquid oily.  
**[1:07:24-1:07:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:24):**  So if your fire is too hot, you're basically incinerating what you're putting in before  
**[1:07:29-1:07:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:29):**  you could utilise it.  
**[1:07:30-1:07:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:30):**  You're not burning it.  
**[1:07:31-1:07:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:31):**  So you're burning through it rather than burning it steadily.  
**[1:07:34-1:07:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:34):**  Which then overfed, undernourished kind of comes in.  
**[1:07:37-1:07:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:37):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[1:07:38-1:07:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:38):**  You are not able to utilise, absorb, assimilate any of the goodness.  
**[1:07:43-1:07:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:43):**  So you know, I know quite a few people who are very kind of active, they're very out  
**[1:07:47-1:07:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:47):**  there and they're putting away a lot of food.  
**[1:07:50-1:07:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:50):**  And you ask them, do they have any problems going to the toilet?  
**[1:07:52-1:07:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:52):**  No, go three, four times a day.  
**[1:07:54-1:07:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:54):**  That's a sign.  
**[1:07:55-1:08:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:07:55):**  And then you look at the Bristol store chart, one, two, three, four, five, which one are  
**[1:08:00-1:08:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:00):**  you?  
**[1:08:01-1:08:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:01):**  And they're the extreme, they're the runs.  
**[1:08:03-1:08:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:03):**  The other extreme is the dry pellets.  
**[1:08:04-1:08:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:04):**  And lovely at number three is that nice, smooth, easy, nothing on the tissue when you wipe,  
**[1:08:10-1:08:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:10):**  you know, passed brilliantly and you feel like complete.  
**[1:08:16-1:08:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:16):**  You feel like you completed that mission.  
**[1:08:19-1:08:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:19):**  Sorry if anyone is eating your breakfast.  
**[1:08:21-1:08:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:21):**  I think the food being mission is important.  
**[1:08:23-1:08:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:23):**  Yeah, and then kaffir.  
**[1:08:24-1:08:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:24):**  So kaffir is, remember it's earthy and it's watery, so they tend to do very kind of large,  
**[1:08:29-1:08:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:29):**  soft poos, you know, and yeah, you can get quite constipated and sticky and tarry when  
**[1:08:37-1:08:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:37):**  they're aggravated.  
**[1:08:38-1:08:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:38):**  So it's a really nice indication of what's going on.  
**[1:08:40-1:08:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:40):**  So you could be a pitta type, have a kaffir aggravation.  
**[1:08:44-1:08:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:44):**  So don't again hang on to what your krikriti or your constitution is because your vikriti  
**[1:08:51-1:08:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:51):**  is really actually about where you're at.  
**[1:08:54-1:08:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:54):**  So you might go and hang out with a whole load of pitas, which might aggravate your  
**[1:08:58-1:08:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:58):**  pitta.  
**[1:08:59-1:09:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:08:59):**  Hanging out with the pitas.  
**[1:09:00-1:09:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:00):**  Yeah, hanging out with the pitas, but it also might make you go, oh God, I don't want to  
**[1:09:03-1:09:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:03):**  be here.  
**[1:09:04-1:09:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:04):**  And you're in your inner, you know, you might feel very, what's the word, inadequate.  
**[1:09:09-1:09:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:09):**  You might start shrinking into, you know, the other doshes kind of come into play.  
**[1:09:13-1:09:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:13):**  So you're just a moving feast basically.  
**[1:09:16-1:09:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:16):**  So it's lovely to get to know all three of the doshes.  
**[1:09:19-1:09:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:19):**  And if you go to my website, you can do a three minute dosha test and actually in answering  
**[1:09:23-1:09:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:23):**  it, are my eyes flicky and dirty?  
**[1:09:25-1:09:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:25):**  Are my lashes long and lush?  
**[1:09:27-1:09:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:27):**  Are my poos like this?  
**[1:09:28-1:09:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:28):**  You get to actually understand.  
**[1:09:29-1:09:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:29):**  What's the website?  
**[1:09:30-1:09:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:30):**  jasminhemsley.com  
**[1:09:31-1:09:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:31):**  There we go.  
**[1:09:32-1:09:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:32):**  Everyone should take a look at that.  
**[1:09:34-1:09:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:34):**  I think is it such a valuable tool, you know, any age group.  
**[1:09:39-1:09:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:39):**  So we talked about twenties, you know, this is anywhere.  
**[1:09:42-1:09:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:42):**  This is great for parents, you know, my mum particularly.

**[1:09:46-1:09:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:46):**  You know, and if you talk about it with your children, you know, your child can articulate  
**[1:09:50-1:09:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:50):**  mum, I'm feeling very hot.  
**[1:09:52-1:09:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:52):**  I need something cooling.  
**[1:09:53-1:09:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:53):**  You know, that's a natural way to bring balance.  
**[1:09:55-1:09:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:55):**  And mum, you know what, I'm feeling under the weather.  
**[1:09:57-1:09:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:57):**  I think I need soup.  
**[1:09:58-1:10:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:09:58):**  You know, because it's, it's pre, soup is predigested if you think about it.  
**[1:10:02-1:10:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:02):**  There's nothing raw to contend with there.  
**[1:10:03-1:10:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:03):**  There's nothing hard to break down.  
**[1:10:05-1:10:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:05):**  And the body when it's, when it's sick, it needs, it needs the easiest fuel without expending  
**[1:10:09-1:10:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:09):**  energy in the wrong place.  
**[1:10:11-1:10:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:11):**  Brilliant.  
**[1:10:12-1:10:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:12):**  Brilliant.  
**[1:10:13-1:10:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:13):**  Sustainable balance.  
**[1:10:14-1:10:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:14):**  You're going to get some soup now?  
**[1:10:15-1:10:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:15):**  I'm going to, I'm going to keep smashing these balls.  
**[1:10:17-1:10:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:17):**  So I'm going to reframe that.  
**[1:10:19-1:10:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:19):**  Who's and smashing balls?  
**[1:10:21-1:10:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:21):**  Smashing balls.  
**[1:10:22-1:10:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:22):**  Smashing balls.  
**[1:10:26-1:10:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:26):**  I think we, I think we, can we talk about fashion?  
**[1:10:29-1:10:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:29):**  Yes, let's do that.  
**[1:10:30-1:10:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:30):**  That's what I was supposed to do, wasn't it?  
**[1:10:32-1:10:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:32):**  No, no, no, because that's, that's so important what we just discussed there.  
**[1:10:35-1:10:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:35):**  Yeah.  
**[1:10:36-1:10:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:36):**  Because we talk about sustainability as if it's reuse, recycle, whether there's a rewilding  
**[1:10:40-1:10:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:40):**  element to it.  
**[1:10:41-1:10:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:41):**  What have we got?  
**[1:10:42-1:10:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:42):**  We've got refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle, recover, rot.  
**[1:10:46-1:10:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:46):**  That is the hierarchy of waste.  
**[1:10:48-1:10:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:48):**  There you go.  
**[1:10:49-1:10:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:49):**  So we need to, you know, we say like going back to Lawrence, the lawyer is what sustainable  
**[1:10:53-1:10:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:53):**  today as the human being.  
**[1:10:55-1:11:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:10:55):**  So even when it comes to that chart up there is not to get so stressed on the refuse, reduce,  
**[1:11:01-1:11:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:01):**  you know, just do what you can.  
**[1:11:03-1:11:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:03):**  Refuse or refuse?  
**[1:11:04-1:11:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:04):**  Refuse.  
**[1:11:05-1:11:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:05):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:06-1:11:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:06):**  So you refuse it.  
**[1:11:08-1:11:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:08):**  I think it's more dump it.  
**[1:11:09-1:11:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:09):**  Oh, is it like refuse?  
**[1:11:10-1:11:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:10):**  Yeah, I think so.  
**[1:11:11-1:11:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:11):**  Oh, I thought it was like refuse something.  
**[1:11:12-1:11:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:12):**  So if someone says, oh, here's a gift and it's plastic and I'm like, oh no, I'm not  
**[1:11:18-1:11:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:18):**  having that.  
**[1:11:19-1:11:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:19):**  Yeah, I do.  
**[1:11:20-1:11:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:20):**  So I now sell people at Christmas and birthdays.  
**[1:11:22-1:11:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:22):**  I don't want anything.  
**[1:11:23-1:11:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:23):**  Nothing.  
**[1:11:24-1:11:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:24):**  No things please.  
**[1:11:25-1:11:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:25):**  We can't, you know, we can't compost or we can't burn.  
**[1:11:29-1:11:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:29):**  We don't want it for the kids.  
**[1:11:30-1:11:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:30):**  I'm going to give you a toilet roll then.  
**[1:11:31-1:11:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:31):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:32-1:11:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:32):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:33-1:11:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:33):**  There we go.  
**[1:11:34-1:11:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:34):**  Toilet roll tube.  
**[1:11:35-1:11:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:35):**  That goes on my compost heap.  
**[1:11:36-1:11:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:36):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:37-1:11:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:37):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:38-1:11:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:38):**  It's, so sustainability and fashion.  
**[1:11:39-1:11:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:39):**  So, you know, I came, before I went into what I'm doing today, I was doing TV commercials,  
**[1:11:46-1:11:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:46):**  but my main line of work was e-commerce.  
**[1:11:48-1:11:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:48):**  Suddenly there's this whole world of e-commerce and I started off doing, you know, you used  
**[1:11:56-1:11:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:56):**  to do a shoot of maybe three outfits a day.  
**[1:11:58-1:12:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:11:58):**  That was back in the kind of fashion days and everything took time.  
**[1:12:01-1:12:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:01):**  Like Lawrence, the lawyer, you would take a Polaroid, the lighting would take all day  
**[1:12:05-1:12:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:05):**  because there was no way to adjust this on a computer.  
**[1:12:07-1:12:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:07):**  There's no way to backtrack.  
**[1:12:09-1:12:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:09):**  You got to get it right there and then.  
**[1:12:10-1:12:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:10):**  So you take all these Polaroids that cost a lot of money by the way, to check the lighting.  
**[1:12:16-1:12:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:16):**  Then you would start shooting.  
**[1:12:18-1:12:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:18):**  Then a courier would come collect the film, one roll of film, take it to be processed.  
**[1:12:22-1:12:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:22):**  Hold on, I can feel James getting really excited here.  
**[1:12:26-1:12:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:26):**  Why?  
**[1:12:27-1:12:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:27):**  Oh, the camera guy.  
**[1:12:28-1:12:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:28):**  He bought a camera, a film camera.  
**[1:12:30-1:12:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:30):**  Yeah.  
**[1:12:31-1:12:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:31):**  What do we call it?  
**[1:12:32-1:12:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:32):**  A film camera.  
**[1:12:33-1:12:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:33):**  He bought a film camera.  
**[1:12:34-1:12:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:34):**  Yeah.  
**[1:12:35-1:12:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:35):**  So he geeked out about it the other day.  
**[1:12:36-1:12:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:36):**  Yeah.  
**[1:12:37-1:12:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:37):**  Yeah.  
**[1:12:38-1:12:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:38):**  You can talk to Nick about that as well.  
**[1:12:39-1:12:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:39):**  And so a courier would come and collect it, take it off to be processed at the lab.  
**[1:12:43-1:12:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:43):**  And so everyone on the shoot would then have a long lunch, come back, check the film.  
**[1:12:48-1:12:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:48):**  Are we good to go?  
**[1:12:49-1:12:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:49):**  Yes.  
**[1:12:50-1:12:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:50):**  Well, we'll start using our 30 quid a pop film then and shoot this guy.  
**[1:12:54-1:12:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:54):**  So that was what a shoot was.  
**[1:12:56-1:12:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:56):**  Then it turned into this digital age.  
**[1:12:58-1:13:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:12:58):**  And I remember lots of photographers going, I'm not going there.  
**[1:13:00-1:13:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:00):**  I'm not going there.  
**[1:13:01-1:13:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:01):**  I'm not going there.  
**[1:13:02-1:13:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:02):**  And they eventually had to, they had to move for the time.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:04):**  So you have to move with the technology.  
**[1:13:07-1:13:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:07):**  And then it moved to eight shots a day, then 20 shots a day, then 30 shots a day.  
**[1:13:13-1:13:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:13):**  So when I say shots a day, that's changes.  
**[1:13:15-1:13:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:15):**  Changes.  
**[1:13:16-1:13:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:16):**  Changes.  
**[1:13:17-1:13:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:17):**  Okay.  
**[1:13:18-1:13:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:18):**  Yeah.  
**[1:13:19-1:13:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:19):**  So when I left, I was doing about between 40 and 60 items of clothing in a day.  
**[1:13:23-1:13:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:23):**  What?  
**[1:13:24-1:13:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:24):**  Yeah.  
**[1:13:25-1:13:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:25):**  Yeah.  
**[1:13:26-1:13:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:26):**  Sustainable, right?  
**[1:13:27-1:13:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:27):**  Yeah.  
**[1:13:28-1:13:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:28):**  So I was watching all this kind of fashion.  
**[1:13:29-1:13:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:29):**  I was putting it on.  
**[1:13:30-1:13:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:30):**  So it was terrible, ill fitting, cheap.  
**[1:13:32-1:13:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:32):**  And you'd literally have the Mac operators there and they'd be stationed and they would  
**[1:13:36-1:13:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:36):**  literally be tucking.  
**[1:13:38-1:13:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:38):**  They'd be, they'd be manipulating the image to make what was essentially a size 12 fit  
**[1:13:43-1:13:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:43):**  my frame, which is smaller and make it all look neat and polished and put together and  
**[1:13:49-1:13:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:49):**  tweak it to get this perfect basically campaign image on the website.  
**[1:13:54-1:13:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:54):**  And it felt a bit gross.  
**[1:13:55-1:14:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:13:55):**  All this clothing coming in and me kind of knowing that it wasn't what it says on the  
**[1:14:00-1:14:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:00):**  tin or what it looked like in the picture.  
**[1:14:02-1:14:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:02):**  So it's not authentic in any way.  
**[1:14:04-1:14:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:04):**  Yeah, it felt a bit ill.  
**[1:14:05-1:14:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:05):**  But you know, I was also a big shopper.  
**[1:14:07-1:14:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:07):**  I hadn't really been somebody who could buy clothes when I was younger.  
**[1:14:11-1:14:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:11):**  And so this was my outlet.  
**[1:14:12-1:14:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:12):**  Plus being a model, you tend to hang around a lot in the shops between castings and you  
**[1:14:18-1:14:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:18):**  go and buy something because suddenly fast fashion was a thing.  
**[1:14:21-1:14:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:21):**  You could literally pick up a top for a father.  
**[1:14:23-1:14:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:23):**  Yeah, you're fully in that world.  
**[1:14:24-1:14:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:24):**  Yeah, I was massively in that world.  
**[1:14:27-1:14:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:27):**  And and when you're a model, you also self-employed.  
**[1:14:30-1:14:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:30):**  So I'd look at my receipts from, you know, high street stores at the end of the year  
**[1:14:34-1:14:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:34):**  and I'd be like 20 items I bought all in one.  
**[1:14:36-1:14:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:36):**  Top, $4.99, air band, $1.99, trousers, knickers, pants, pack of three socks, another top, another  
**[1:14:43-1:14:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:43):**  top, you know, I was thinking, I don't even know what those things are.  
**[1:14:47-1:14:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:47):**  That's quite scary.  
**[1:14:48-1:14:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:48):**  That's disconnected.  
**[1:14:49-1:14:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:49):**  So, and it was, you know, source.  
**[1:14:52-1:14:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:52):**  Yeah.  
**[1:14:53-1:15:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:14:53):**  And so it became as I moved into food and realising it's not just what you're eating,  
**[1:15:00-1:15:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:00):**  it's when you're eating, it's how you're eating.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:02):**  I just became a lot more conscious of my environment and the actions I took and bit by bit that  
**[1:15:07-1:15:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:07):**  started to reflect in.  
**[1:15:08-1:15:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:08):**  I remember 12, 10 years ago sitting with my bestie going, I'm going to start wearing pajamas  
**[1:15:14-1:15:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:14):**  and decided that I needed pajamas.  
**[1:15:17-1:15:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:17):**  I didn't own any.  
**[1:15:18-1:15:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:18):**  I used to wear an old t-shirt.  
**[1:15:20-1:15:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:20):**  Tried to find an organic pair of pajamas.  
**[1:15:21-1:15:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:21):**  Nothing came up.  
**[1:15:22-1:15:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:22):**  And I thought, I live in London.  
**[1:15:24-1:15:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:24):**  Surely someone's doing organic cotton pajamas.  
**[1:15:26-1:15:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:26):**  No.  
**[1:15:27-1:15:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:27):**  Bit by bit though, more brands, more designers started to come up and do this.  
**[1:15:32-1:15:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:32):**  And I thought, you know what?  
**[1:15:33-1:15:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:33):**  I'm going to support them.  
**[1:15:34-1:15:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:34):**  When I buy new, I'm going to, I'm going to look to these guys first.  
**[1:15:37-1:15:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:37):**  And I have to say most of the time it wasn't my style.  
**[1:15:40-1:15:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:40):**  It wasn't my taste.  
**[1:15:41-1:15:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:41):**  And also it's very expensive at that time.  
**[1:15:43-1:15:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:43):**  It's very, very expensive.  
**[1:15:44-1:15:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:44):**  It's the thing that usually comes up.  
**[1:15:46-1:15:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:46):**  So I was sent this, this is, um, organic something, organic company, right?  
**[1:15:51-1:15:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:51):**  Here we go.  
**[1:15:52-1:15:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:52):**  Want to say them?  
**[1:15:53-1:15:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:53):**  Yeah, go on.  
**[1:15:54-1:15:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:54):**  Okay.  
**[1:15:55-1:15:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:55):**  Oh, they're saving money.  
**[1:15:57-1:15:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:57):**  Label this.  
**[1:15:59-1:16:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:15:59):**  So it's, um, so they sent it and then I, and they said, oh, would you mind putting up something  
**[1:16:03-1:16:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:03):**  on store?  
**[1:16:04-1:16:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:04):**  I was like, yeah, yeah, perfectly fine doing it.  
**[1:16:06-1:16:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:06):**  Then someone wrote to me, are you kidding me?  
**[1:16:08-1:16:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:08):**  How much was it?  
**[1:16:09-1:16:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:09):**  95 pounds for a t-shirt, for a v-neck t-shirt and a pair of pants.  
**[1:16:14-1:16:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:14):**  And so I responded, I just said, well, you have to understand that we have to get behind  
**[1:16:17-1:16:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:17):**  companies like this because they have to go through that transitional phase and we have  
**[1:16:22-1:16:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:22):**  to respect the monetary costs of that.  
**[1:16:25-1:16:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:25):**  It's a huge expense to transform from a company that then look at sustainable measures.  
**[1:16:30-1:16:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:30):**  And how many units are they shifting?  
**[1:16:32-1:16:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:32):**  You know, when you look at companies that literally make five P on every garment or  
**[1:16:37-1:16:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:37):**  every product they sell, but they're selling so many, how do you even compete against those  
**[1:16:42-1:16:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:42):**  people?  
**[1:16:43-1:16:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:43):**  It's also the packaging, right?  
**[1:16:44-1:16:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:44):**  So um, it's, it used to be like what every item would be in its own plastic wrap.  
**[1:16:52-1:16:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:52):**  Yes.  
**[1:16:53-1:16:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:53):**  So you say this would have come in its own plastic wrap, right?  
**[1:16:55-1:16:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:55):**  So a friend of mine has a leggings business.  
**[1:16:57-1:17:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:16:57):**  He said it started off at, I think five years ago, they were getting one pair of leggings.  
**[1:17:00-1:17:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:00):**  So this is nuts, right?  
**[1:17:01-1:17:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:01):**  We've got to stop this.  
**[1:17:02-1:17:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:02):**  Can we have this?  
**[1:17:03-1:17:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:03):**  Yeah.  
**[1:17:04-1:17:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:04):**  Well, no, we don't have that yet.  
**[1:17:06-1:17:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:06):**  So that's go for this whole thing where it went.  
**[1:17:07-1:17:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:07):**  So the mechanism has changed.  
**[1:17:10-1:17:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:10):**  The factories have changed and that was the biggest cost.  
**[1:17:13-1:17:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:13):**  Right?  
**[1:17:14-1:17:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:14):**  So that really reflected in how much you could charge for leggings.  
**[1:17:17-1:17:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:17):**  And that was at that stage to have 10 leggings in one plastic wrap.  
**[1:17:22-1:17:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:22):**  And then once they had them, they would individually wrap them all in paper and then send them  
**[1:17:26-1:17:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:26):**  out.  
**[1:17:27-1:17:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:27):**  So then just the hours alone.  
**[1:17:28-1:17:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:28):**  Yes.  
**[1:17:29-1:17:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:29):**  And if you think about it, you know, when you look at maybe some designer, some designer  
**[1:17:33-1:17:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:33):**  brands, the box, so the shoe comes in a shoe bag.  
**[1:17:38-1:17:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:38):**  I'm going to squat.  
**[1:17:39-1:17:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:39):**  Tony is moving, trying to find a new position for this body.  
**[1:17:43-1:17:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:43):**  There you go.  
**[1:17:44-1:17:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:44):**  He's going to squat now.  
**[1:17:45-1:17:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:45):**  That's something like a squat, that'll do for now.  
**[1:17:47-1:17:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:47):**  Oh, so good.  
**[1:17:49-1:17:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:49):**  So shoes will come in a shoe bag to protect the individual shoe, which would then come  
**[1:17:54-1:17:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:54):**  in a shoe box.  
**[1:17:55-1:17:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:55):**  But then the shoe box was also part, became part of the offering.  
**[1:17:59-1:18:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:17:59):**  So then the shoe box would then be protected by something else.  
**[1:18:02-1:18:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:02):**  And it starts to become all this, you know what I mean?  
**[1:18:05-1:18:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:05):**  Because everyone wants something fresh and new.  
**[1:18:07-1:18:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:07):**  You know, I remember people, I used to work in a shoe shop and they didn't want the box  
**[1:18:13-1:18:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:13):**  that was a bit battered.  
**[1:18:14-1:18:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:14):**  And I'm like, it's the box, it's not the shoes.  
**[1:18:17-1:18:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:17):**  You're not wearing the box.  
**[1:18:18-1:18:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:18):**  You're going to go home and you put that box in the bin.  
**[1:18:21-1:18:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:21):**  We've got some battered shoes, we put them in a really nice box.  
**[1:18:24-1:18:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:24):**  And it's funny because it changes your mentality.  
**[1:18:26-1:18:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:26):**  And now, you know, we're sitting in this place called, you know, Lesser Litter.  
**[1:18:31-1:18:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:31):**  And there's a whole new type of person coming in here who doesn't want the packaging.  
**[1:18:38-1:18:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:38):**  They don't want the packaging at all.  
**[1:18:39-1:18:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:39):**  So we're shifting, we are shifting.  
**[1:18:41-1:18:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:41):**  And that's what's exciting.  
**[1:18:42-1:18:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:42):**  And this is where technology is brilliant.  
**[1:18:44-1:18:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:44):**  Not only can it solve the problem of getting 10 leggings into a guy rather than just one,  
**[1:18:49-1:18:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:49):**  it can also spread the message.  
**[1:18:52-1:18:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:52):**  You know, I remember when I didn't want to have chemical laden beauty products used on  
**[1:18:57-1:18:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:57):**  me.  
**[1:18:58-1:19:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:18:58):**  I'd spent 15 years under baking hot lights with endocrine disruptive chemicals in makeup  
**[1:19:04-1:19:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:04):**  products, cooking them into my skin.  
**[1:19:06-1:19:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:06):**  But to stand up and, you know, and say, I don't want my skin to look like, are you off  
**[1:19:11-1:19:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:11):**  your rocker?  
**[1:19:12-1:19:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:12):**  What do you want?  
**[1:19:13-1:19:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:13):**  Cashmere wrapped lipstick.  
**[1:19:14-1:19:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:14):**  You know, that's what they think.  
**[1:19:16-1:19:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:16):**  It's like, it's like chemical free.  
**[1:19:18-1:19:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:18):**  How precious is she?  
**[1:19:19-1:19:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:19):**  She can't handle a bit of, you know, and we just don't fully understand it.  
**[1:19:24-1:19:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:24):**  And we also think that to be chemical free is to be a luxury rather than a requirement,  
**[1:19:30-1:19:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:30):**  a human requirement.  
**[1:19:31-1:19:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:31):**  And when I say chemical free, you know, everything's chemicals.  
**[1:19:34-1:19:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:34):**  I'm talking about, you know, disruptive chemicals.  
**[1:19:37-1:19:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:37):**  What is it?  
**[1:19:38-1:19:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:38):**  What's harsh?  
**[1:19:39-1:19:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:39):**  What's harsh.  
**[1:19:40-1:19:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:40):**  And so, yeah, so I basically started to put these companies.  
**[1:19:42-1:19:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:42):**  And I've changed my stance a lot in many ways.  
**[1:19:45-1:19:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:45):**  One of the things I've always been is I've always been quite thrifty.  
**[1:19:49-1:19:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:49):**  My parents are both thrifty.  
**[1:19:50-1:19:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:50):**  I love a second hand.  
**[1:19:52-1:19:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:52):**  I love picking up furniture from the side of the road.  
**[1:19:56-1:19:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:56):**  I love fixing things and mending things.  
**[1:19:58-1:20:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:19:58):**  And I love vintage charity.  
**[1:20:00-1:20:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:00):**  You name it, hand me downs.  
**[1:20:02-1:20:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:02):**  And that's part of my life.  
**[1:20:03-1:20:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:03):**  So I'm really trying to encourage people who are kind of freaked out by wearing other people's  
**[1:20:07-1:20:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:07):**  clothes or something that's not new.  
**[1:20:09-1:20:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:09):**  I've got something on my website that helps you to shift the energy of the person who  
**[1:20:14-1:20:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:14):**  previously wore it.  
**[1:20:15-1:20:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:15):**  Oh, so like a ceremony?  
**[1:20:16-1:20:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:16):**  A ceremony.  
**[1:20:17-1:20:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:17):**  Yeah, lovely.  
**[1:20:18-1:20:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:18):**  Intention based or using palo santo or are you sound or...  
**[1:20:21-1:20:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:21):**  So giving thanks to the person that's worn it.  
**[1:20:23-1:20:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:23):**  Exactly.  
**[1:20:24-1:20:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:24):**  And then saying, you know, I'm hoping that their energies leave it and this is now its  
**[1:20:28-1:20:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:28):**  new life with me.  
**[1:20:29-1:20:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:29):**  And I think that's important.  
**[1:20:30-1:20:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:30):**  And I think a lot of these rituals that we dismiss as, you know, woo woo are important  
**[1:20:35-1:20:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:35):**  because it brings us to the present moment.  
**[1:20:37-1:20:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:37):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:20:38-1:20:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:38):**  It brings us to our intentions.  
**[1:20:41-1:20:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:41):**  It helps us to, yeah, to have the right energy in and around things.  
**[1:20:49-1:20:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:49):**  And also, you know, I do a lot of kind of modeling, if you like, for free.  
**[1:20:55-1:21:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:20:55):**  A lot of brands who are on the sustainable kind of track to highlight, you know, highlight  
**[1:21:02-1:21:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:21:02):**  their existence to other people who are looking for, you know, a new T-shirt or a new pair  
**[1:21:07-1:21:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:21:07):**  of trainers or, you know, like Len Samay said, you know, she loved these trainers that I  
**[1:21:11-1:21:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:21:11):**  was wearing and she's worn them all summer.  
**[1:21:13-1:21:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:21:13):**  And she didn't know you could get a sustainable pair of trainers, you know, that didn't use  
**[1:21:16-1:21:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:21:16):**  natural materials like wool, didn't use these harsh glues, etc.  
**[1:21:22-1:21:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:21:22):**  And I know I'm very aware that, yes, when you're talking about a five pound vest in  
**[1:21:28-1:21:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:21:28):**  comparison to an ethically bought 70 quid vest, it's going to rule a lot of people out.  
**[1:21:36-1:21:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:21:36):**  It does, but you know what?  
**[1:21:39-1:21:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:21:39):**  My friends joke about this, but I bought, I bought years ago, 20 something years ago,  
**[1:21:46-1:21:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:21:46):**  I bought a Miu Miu jacket.  
**[1:21:50-1:21:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:21:50):**  I bought a Vivienne Westwood coat.  
**[1:21:55-1:21:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:21:55):**  And I still have them today and they're real classics.  
**[1:21:59-1:22:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:21:59):**  And everyone today, you get that jacket, that's amazing.  
**[1:22:03-1:22:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:03):**  You know, and that's the difference.  
**[1:22:04-1:22:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:04):**  Yes.  
**[1:22:05-1:22:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:05):**  So I'm wearing underneath here, this is a brand called Basic, which has sustainable  
**[1:22:11-1:22:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:11):**  credentials, which I didn't know at the time I bought it in Australia.  
**[1:22:14-1:22:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:14):**  Is that organic Basic?  
**[1:22:15-1:22:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:15):**  Yes.  
**[1:22:16-1:22:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:16):**  So this is organic Basic?  
**[1:22:17-1:22:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:17):**  Oh, it's Basic.  
**[1:22:18-1:22:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:18):**  OK.  
**[1:22:19-1:22:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:19):**  B A S S I K E. No?  
**[1:22:20-1:22:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:20):**  No, different one.  
**[1:22:21-1:22:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:21):**  OK.  
**[1:22:22-1:22:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:22):**  Mine's called Basic.  
**[1:22:23-1:22:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:23):**  It's Australian brand.  
**[1:22:24-1:22:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:24):**  I'm doing really well as an influencer with this brand, aren't I?  
**[1:22:25-1:22:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:25):**  With no label.  
**[1:22:26-1:22:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:26):**  To be fair, there's no label in it.  
**[1:22:28-1:22:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:28):**  You know, and I bought it exactly 10 years ago.  
**[1:22:31-1:22:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:31):**  I was in Australia exactly 10 years ago and I still wear it all the time.  
**[1:22:35-1:22:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:35):**  I can't promise that I wear all my wardrobe.  
**[1:22:37-1:22:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:37):**  I've got quite a big wardrobe.  
**[1:22:38-1:22:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:38):**  I'm going to hold my hands up here.  
**[1:22:39-1:22:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:39):**  But a lot of it is secondhand.  
**[1:22:41-1:22:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:41):**  A lot of it's hand-me-downs.  
**[1:22:44-1:22:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:44):**  And I get gifted a lot as well from these designers because I do show things off.  
**[1:22:47-1:22:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:47):**  But not everything's gifted.  
**[1:22:48-1:22:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:48):**  I send it back.  
**[1:22:51-1:22:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:51):**  And I just think even I'm even a bit pro greenwashing, to be honest, because I love that there are  
**[1:22:58-1:23:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:22:58):**  extremists out there that will take it apart.  
**[1:23:01-1:23:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:01):**  If you say I'm organic and biodynamic and, you know, plastic free, there are experts  
**[1:23:07-1:23:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:07):**  out there who will tear you down.  
**[1:23:09-1:23:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:09):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[1:23:10-1:23:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:10):**  But in greenwashing, we are making it more of a language.  
**[1:23:13-1:23:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:13):**  I am interested in a vegan lipstick.  
**[1:23:15-1:23:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:15):**  I don't want my makeup tested on animals.  
**[1:23:17-1:23:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:17):**  I don't want this crap.  
**[1:23:18-1:23:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:18):**  I don't want blubber.  
**[1:23:19-1:23:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:19):**  You know, blubber in my lipstick.  
**[1:23:20-1:23:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:20):**  That was a thing once upon a time.  
**[1:23:23-1:23:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:23):**  And so it's changing the conversation.  
**[1:23:25-1:23:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:25):**  It's making us more aware and we're moving in that direction.  
**[1:23:27-1:23:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:27):**  And because it's a competitive market, that's the world we live in.  
**[1:23:31-1:23:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:31):**  Brands will change.  
**[1:23:32-1:23:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:32):**  They have to change.  
**[1:23:33-1:23:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:33):**  They have to change.  
**[1:23:35-1:23:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:35):**  So we are some faster than others.  
**[1:23:39-1:23:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:39):**  We're moving.  
**[1:23:40-1:23:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:40):**  We're moving in the right direction.  
**[1:23:41-1:23:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:41):**  And I think that's what's important.  
**[1:23:42-1:23:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:42):**  Yes.  
**[1:23:43-1:23:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:43):**  If we individually make such changes, eventually, you know, there's more people getting that  
**[1:23:48-1:23:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:48):**  bubble.  
**[1:23:49-1:23:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:49):**  Definitely.  
**[1:23:50-1:23:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:50):**  In whatever way it is.  
**[1:23:51-1:23:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:51):**  If you're conscious about one of your 10 decisions that you make, that's progress.  
**[1:23:55-1:23:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:55):**  That's brilliant.  
**[1:23:56-1:23:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:56):**  Yeah.  
**[1:23:57-1:23:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:57):**  I think, you know, this is my favourite quote from the Dalai Lama.  
**[1:23:59-1:24:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:23:59):**  If you think you're too small to make a difference, try sleeping with a mosquito.  
**[1:24:03-1:24:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:03):**  I think I'm going to go.  
**[1:24:04-1:24:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:04):**  Do you know what I think?  
**[1:24:05-1:24:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:05):**  There was one in my room last night.  
**[1:24:06-1:24:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:06):**  I think I'm actually, I think we should finish it there.  
**[1:24:10-1:24:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:10):**  I love it.  
**[1:24:11-1:24:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:11):**  It's such a good quote.  
**[1:24:12-1:24:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:12):**  It's beautiful.  
**[1:24:13-1:24:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:13):**  I think mine's been more up more than the sound of that mosquito.  
**[1:24:16-1:24:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:16):**  That's when you have to practice really good meditation.  
**[1:24:18-1:24:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:18):**  Like, okay.  
**[1:24:19-1:24:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:19):**  Jasmine, fab.  
**[1:24:20-1:24:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:20):**  Thank you Tony.  
**[1:24:21-1:24:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:21):**  Just catching the train all the way here.  
**[1:24:23-1:24:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:23):**  Your body's exhausted.  
**[1:24:24-1:24:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:24):**  I've mentally exhausted you.  
**[1:24:25-1:24:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:25):**  Yes.  
**[1:24:26-1:24:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:26):**  Thanks Tony.

**[1:24:34-1:24:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:34):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:24:35-1:24:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:35):**  Making waves.  
**[1:24:36-1:24:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:36):**  Yeah.  
**[1:24:37-1:24:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:37):**  Super.  
**[1:24:38-1:24:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:38):**  Can't wait to see you on day 10.  
**[1:24:42-1:24:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:42):**  Boom.  
**[1:24:43-1:24:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:43):**  I really enjoyed that conversation with Jasmine.  
**[1:24:47-1:24:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:47):**  What a beautiful soul.  
**[1:24:48-1:24:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-2-Jasmine-Hemsley-e59gj0#t=1:24:48):**  If you feel the need to find more balance, let's face it, who doesn't?

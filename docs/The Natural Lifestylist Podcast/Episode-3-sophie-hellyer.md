### The Natural Lifestylist Podcast  (Sun, 15 Sep 2019 08:52:32)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:00):**  Hi, I'm Tony Riddle and this is the Natural Lifestylist podcast.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:06):**  So way back in December I had this crazy idea to run from Land's End to John O'Groats in  
**[0:00:11-0:00:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:11):**  just 30 days.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:12):**  But I wasn't just going to run it, I was going to run it barefoot to raise funds for environmental  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:17):**  charities and collaborate with world leading experts to raise awareness and money for six  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:23):**  organisations fighting the top sustainability issues of our time.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:28):**  I knew running barefoot would raise many a socially extreme eyebrow and with that eyebrow  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:32):**  raising behaviour I would be able to provide a perfect platform to highlight the importance  
**[0:00:37-0:00:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:37):**  of connecting with our environment and those key sustainability issues of our time.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:44):**  Today I'm joined behind the mic with my rewild, rice fierce, wild swimming, surfing and sustainability  
**[0:00:51-0:00:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:51):**  sister.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:52):**  The one and only Sophie Hellyer.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:56):**  To those closer to her, Sophie Hellyer.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:00):**  Sophie was once a champion surfer at national level.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:03):**  She co-created the movement Rise Fierce, which inspires women to try cold water swimming,  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:09):**  promoting body neutrality and improving mental and physical health.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:15):**  Sophie has become a prominent voice on matters of ocean pollution, plastic waste, sustainable  
**[0:01:20-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:20):**  fashion and eco-friendly living.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:23):**  As I'd taken forever to run 20 miles to get to Sophie, this is a brief convo of just 25  
**[0:01:30-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:30):**  minutes.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:31):**  However, it's potent and we packed in a lot of sustainability magic here.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:35):**  I really do hope you enjoy that magic.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:39):**  Peace out.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:42):**  So I'm here with wonderful Sophie.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:43):**  I nearly forgot your name Sophie.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:45):**  It's 25 miles in today and I'm a bit wiped, but I'm going to hold space because I realised  
**[0:01:50-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:50):**  that part of this commitment to running 30 miles a day was also to hold space for sustainability  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:57):**  experts.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:58):**  I'm going to call Sophie a sustainability expert because I've been following her for  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:01):**  quite some time now.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:02):**  As well as being into wild swimming just like myself and rewilding, there's so much more  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:08):**  to her and I think we all need to hear from Sophie.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:12):**  It's just a shame we only have about 20 minutes.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:15):**  But welcome Sophie.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:17):**  Hi.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:18):**  It's really good to see you.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:19):**  It's great.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:20):**  I know.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:21):**  I nearly sobbed on your shoulder.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:23):**  I just needed that female energy to bring me in.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:28):**  You've got another few miles to go.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:32):**  So people might know you as a surfer.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:35):**  Yeah, I guess.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:37):**  It's kind of weird as well.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:38):**  People ask what I do because I haven't surfed competitively for a long time now and I've  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:44):**  been living in London the last year.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:46):**  I'm still very attached to the fact I surf and I'm a surfer but it's not really what  
**[0:02:50-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:50):**  I do for a job anymore.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:51):**  Yeah, so that's for people that don't know Sophie.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:54):**  Hell yeah.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:55):**  Hell yeah.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:56):**  Hell yeah.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:57):**  What does Sophie do?  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:58):**  Sophie.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:59):**  What does a Sophie do?  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:00):**  I hold women's retreats, cold water swimming, yoga and surfing.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:06):**  They have an amazing hashtag.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:08):**  What is it?  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:09):**  Rise Fierce.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:10):**  Rise Fierce.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:11):**  I love that.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:12):**  We started a women's kind of outdoor wild swimming movement called Rise Fierce.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:16):**  It did begin about getting up in the morning and being fierce and it became about so much  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:19):**  more about rising up in life to meet whatever challenges you're fronted with.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:25):**  But yeah, so I run the women's retreats.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:27):**  I also write for different magazines and newspapers.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:30):**  So I basically use sport as a vehicle to talk about environmental.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:35):**  Keep going.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:36):**  Keep going.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:37):**  Keep going.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:38):**  Environmental and...  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:39):**  I've just got to ditch the chair.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:40):**  I can't cope.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:41):**  I'm coming down as well.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:42):**  That's good.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:43):**  We're changing to the spot.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:44):**  How's the camera level?  
**[0:03:45-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:45):**  Oh, sorry, sorry.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:46):**  Sorry.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:47):**  There we go.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:48):**  James is on fire.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:49):**  We're good.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:50):**  So I write for freelance, different magazines and newspapers and I basically use sport as  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:53):**  a vehicle to talk about different environmental and feminist issues, social issues, I guess.  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:59):**  And I do a bit of freelance producing and I do some public speaking and yeah, I get  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:05):**  a different job every week.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:07):**  It is a different job every week.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:09):**  It seems like that.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:10):**  If there's someone that follows you, it's like, ah, she's so busy.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:12):**  It's like work, work, work, work, work.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:15):**  So if we're talking about sustainability, how do you sustain that yourself?  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:18):**  Because we're all into sustainability, but it also needs to be how does Sophie the human  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:22):**  sustain?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:23):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:24):**  And I really do.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:25):**  I had a bit of a challenging day yesterday.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:27):**  Someone very close to me lives with quite serious mental health issues and can be really  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:35):**  hard for me to support that sometimes.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:36):**  So I really like for me, the cold water swimming is my, that's my kind of saviour.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:44):**  Like for me that going in the cold water is like hitting the reset button.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:47):**  It just helps me like completely restart my day, deal with everything.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:51):**  And the same with if I can't go swimming, then yoga, like finding that space on my mat  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:55):**  and that time is kind of really the me time.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:58):**  It's like the water is my church, I guess.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:02):**  Yeah, it's lovely.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:04):**  I feel that.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:06):**  It's been my saviour on this run.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:08):**  It's kind of, we're staying at the moment on this farm and I have a stream and a fire  
**[0:05:12-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:12):**  and I get and sit in the stream and it's just like if there was a sound to it, it would  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:19):**  definitely be, you know, as I put my feet into the water and then I can just feel the  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:25):**  system just starting to just melt away really, which is bizarre because you're in cold water,  
**[0:05:30-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:30):**  right?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:31):**  But it's just, it's that softening.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:32):**  It's definitely a great space to get into.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:35):**  All right.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:36):**  So outside the human of Sophie, then let's get, let's get into sustainability.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:39):**  We're going to smash through it because we've got like a really quick time now.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:42):**  Tony's got an important phone call with the BBC.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:44):**  I've got a phone call with the BBC.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:49):**  Plastic free periods.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:51):**  So can we go there?  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:52):**  Because I'm a dad of three girls, right?  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:54):**  Yeah, you're going to have to go there.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:55):**  And I think, and I think these conversations are so important again, like why am I running  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:59):**  this 30 miles a day, 30 consecutive days?  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:02):**  It's because that's what I can do, right?  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:04):**  That's the thing I can give.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:05):**  And also it's a message for my kids that when I'm older in 20 years time, it's not going  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:10):**  to be, well, what did you, what did you do in the, with this huge decline right now?  
**[0:06:14-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:14):**  Right.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:15):**  And so I want to be able to educate them in things like plastic free periods.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:18):**  Right.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:19):**  It's like definitely there.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:20):**  So, um, I grew up surfing in North Devon and it was a regular occurrence there to see you  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:25):**  sanctuary pads and tampons and condoms kind of floating past you in the sea.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:29):**  And I've had sanitary pads kind of hit me in the face before when I'm paddling for a  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:33):**  wave.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:34):**  Wonderful.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:35):**  The plastic tampon applicators as like I did a beach clean actually on the Thames by my  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:40):**  house in London last week.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:41):**  I saw it.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:42):**  I saw it.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:44):**  I probably found in an hour, I think I found like maybe 40 plastic tampon applicators on  
**[0:06:47-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:47):**  the beach.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:48):**  Basically anything that goes down the toilet ends up in the rivers or in the sea.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:53):**  Um, if not in landfill, I think landfills probably the best place it can go, which is  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:58):**  pretty depressing.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:59):**  Um, but luckily there are loads of reusable kind of sustainable alternatives to so like  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:06):**  tampons, most tampons have like a lot of them have plastic applicators, but even the ones  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:11):**  that don't contain a thin layer of plastic inside them and they're basically bleach cotton  
**[0:07:14-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:14):**  walls.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:15):**  It's pretty nasty thing to be putting inside yourself.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:17):**  And sanitary pads contain the same plastic as about four or five plastic carrier bags.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:22):**  And in the UK, so that's like endocrine disruptors as well.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:25):**  Right.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:26):**  Um, I have no idea how bad it is for your body, but I'm sure it's pretty bad.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:31):**  It's totally normalized.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:33):**  And actually the reusable alternatives are not normalized and people think they're kind  
**[0:07:38-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:38):**  of weird and hippie-ish, but which is, I mean, I guess I'm a hippie.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:45):**  But, um, in the UK, I think it's 2.5 million tampons and 1.5 million million sanitary pads  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:52):**  are flushed down the toilet every single day.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:54):**  That's incredible.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:57):**  There's a whole lot of kind of plastic just getting flushed down the toilet and most of  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:00):**  it finding its way out into the sea.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:03):**  And it's so aligned with Surfers Against Sewage who I met.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:04):**  I met Hugo Tag home the other day.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:05):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:06):**  You two have really been hitting it off.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:07):**  You've been meeting?  
**[0:08:08-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:08):**  I'm going to meet Hugo next week.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:09):**  Brilliant.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:10):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:11):**  I love Surfers Against Sewage.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:12):**  So that's where we're, I'm moving down to that area soon.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:15):**  So yeah, it's just such great work.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:18):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:19):**  You know, cause really we're talking about what the individual can do right now, right?  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:23):**  So taking control of, like, especially for a woman to be able to take control of her  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:26):**  cycle like that.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:27):**  And I don't know how far in depth to go with it, but if you're starting to, so like one  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:32):**  of the main reusable alternatives is menstrual cups.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:34):**  So I use one called a moon cup, which is just like a small little silica cup.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:39):**  You basically just fold and pop inside yourself.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:40):**  It collects the blood for eight hours.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:42):**  You pop out, empty it, rinse it, reuse it.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:44):**  So you're not flushing it down the toilet and getting rid of it at the end.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:46):**  You're just reusing this silicon cup for years.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:49):**  Wow.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:50):**  Well, nothing leaks.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:52):**  You don't need pads or anything like that with it.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:54):**  I mean, if you're scared of leakage, then you can leave it in for like up to eight hours  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:57):**  as well.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:58):**  So you don't have to be changing it all the time, which is really useful.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:01):**  You can also get period pants, which are great, especially for teens.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:04):**  So like when your young girls come into having their periods, period pants are amazing cause  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:08):**  you just put on pants and carry on your day.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:10):**  And they're growing, are they?  
**[0:09:11-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:11):**  Are they quite common now?  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:12):**  I think they're definitely getting more mainstream and more popular.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:14):**  There's a couple of brands that make quite, there's like brands like Thinx and Flux are  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:19):**  making like good stylish pants.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:20):**  And again, that's moving towards organics and sustainable.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:23):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:24):**  But they're using the cup kind of makes you really in tune with your cycle a bit more  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:28):**  cause you're kind of seeing the blood and the color of the blood, the consistency of  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:31):**  the blood and just kind of like, for me, that's the aspect of like the rewarding part.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:37):**  Again, just, it's not this thing that you never see and you flush away.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:39):**  It's like you're actually getting in tune with what's coming out your body and what's  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:43):**  going on.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:44):**  I think it's so important, isn't it?  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:45):**  Because um, yeah, I think most people lost touch anyway.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:50):**  You lost touch of a hormonal system.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:51):**  I mean, it's so important, isn't it?  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:53):**  Yeah, totally.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:54):**  So what about, um, alternatives for contraception then?  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:57):**  So I, um, track my cycle.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:00):**  There's obviously, there's absolutely no one size fits all contraception and you kind of  
**[0:10:03-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:03):**  have to work out what works for you.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:05):**  And I know some people have conditions, they can't use certain things, but I track my cycle.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:09):**  I take my temperature every morning.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:11):**  I use an app which, um, I know a lot of, there's, there gets a lot of press, some good and some  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:17):**  bad.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:18):**  There's an app called natural cycles, um, which works really well for me and my body.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:22):**  So I have a really regular cycle.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:24):**  Um, I sleep like the same amount every night.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:27):**  You know, I go to bed at 10 and I wake up at six and so for me with a regular lifestyle,  
**[0:10:31-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:31):**  it really fits.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:32):**  I just take my temperature every morning.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:33):**  I put it in the app and the algorithm basically tells me whether I'm on a green day or a red  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:37):**  day.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:38):**  And if you're on a red day, it means that you use, if you're having sex and you're not  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:42):**  looking to conceive, then you just use other contraception.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:44):**  So on a red day we would either use condoms or yeah.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:50):**  So I have been off of the pill for about, God, I was on the pill from when I was 15  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:56):**  for a decade.  
**[0:10:57-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:57):**  So 10 years on the contraceptive pill.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:59):**  Um, wreaking havoc on the hormonal system.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:02):**  Which again, I mean for some people the pills amazing and some people it really works.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:06):**  But for me, like that was a really challenging time for me in my life when I had, I was experiencing  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:11):**  depression and I'm not sure what effect my hormones had and all of that as well.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:16):**  So it felt really good to kind of come off of it and embrace the natural thing a little  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:22):**  bit more.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:23):**  It definitely suits my lifestyle better.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:24):**  Well, it is getting back into rewilding again, isn't it?  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:26):**  And I guess if you worked with that and you're working with your cycle, you have so much  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:30):**  more in tune, aren't you?  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:31):**  Yeah, it's just, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:33):**  It's a kind of a delicate thing to talk about.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:35):**  I know a lot of people, whenever I talk about tracking my cycle the natural way, I get a  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:40):**  lot of pushback and a lot of people kind of speaking up against it.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:44):**  It seems to be the thing that people want to police the most in a way.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:48):**  Like people aren't very happy to hear that you're embracing your cycle and tracking it  
**[0:11:51-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:51):**  naturally like.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:52):**  Yeah, but okay, but what's the stats on how successful that is compared to?  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:57):**  Um, so the app I use is FDA approved contraception.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:01):**  Um, and it's in the same effectiveness category as a contraceptive pill and it's more effective  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:07):**  than condoms.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:08):**  So do we know what the sentries are on condoms?  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:11):**  Do we know that?  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:12):**  I don't know off the top of my head, but I think condoms are like in high 80s.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:15):**  I don't want to say the exact stats you have to do.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:19):**  You can find it on a quick Google, but the pill and the app with like with normal use  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:26):**  or whatever in the mid nineties.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:29):**  And then I think the IUD, like the coil is the highest one.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:33):**  But you know, people say like, tracking your cycle the natural way is bad.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:38):**  With the coil and it's created lots of stagnation and they get a lot of mechanical back pain.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:43):**  So there's other stuff that comes through with that.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:46):**  I know a few of my friends have had them fit and had a bad experience, but I'm sure for  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:50):**  every bad experience, it's a good experience.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:53):**  Hmm.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:54):**  I just, yeah, the, it's interesting.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:57):**  Whenever I talk about tracking my cycle, the natural way, someone will always come up and  
**[0:13:00-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:00):**  go, Oh, my friend's got pregnant doing that.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:02):**  But I'm sure a lot of people's friends have also got pregnant using condoms and on the  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:05):**  pill, but for some reason you never get the bite back if you're taught like the, the,  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:09):**  yeah, because you're seen as this stage, it's seen again as socially extreme.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:15):**  Even though it's perfectly normal.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:17):**  Right.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:18):**  And it's been like that forever.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:19):**  Right.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:20):**  Obviously not using temperature, but other means.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:23):**  It's so good, Sophie, because I was, I was hit by a question on a podcast.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:27):**  I think it was wandering into, wandering into wild, wandering into wildness, wildness into  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:33):**  wondering and somewhere through the podcast, the woman said to me, just because it's my  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:38):**  field, I think I just want to ask you, what are you going to teach?  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:42):**  What are you going to teach your children around their cycle?  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:46):**  And I was, and it was so out of context because we were off on some kind of on another journey.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:52):**  And I was a bit like, um, um, I guess Katarina's going to have that conversation with them,  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:57):**  which I would expect, which seems perfectly normal to me that it would be the mum that  
**[0:14:01-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:01):**  would be in that.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:02):**  And I think it's also important for dads to have an understanding of it totally, you know,  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:06):**  to be involved and to help celebrate it.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:10):**  The same as what I said, if I had a son that, you know, I'm going to create like a real  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:13):**  rite of passage around his voice breaking.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:16):**  You know, and for Lola and Millie, again, I want to create a ceremony or a celebration  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:21):**  for them to honor it.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:22):**  So much like shame and stigma attached around periods.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:25):**  And yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:26):**  Like what if when you got your first period, you threw a little party and you were like,  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:30):**  celebrate it as opposed to like hiding and thinking it's this dirty thing.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:34):**  And I think that addressing that shame around it and kind of breaking period taboos is the  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:38):**  first stage to addressing like period poverty.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:42):**  Other things like FGM still going on in the UK and around the world.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:45):**  What's period poverty?  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:46):**  Period poverty is basically loads of girls and women in the UK and all over the world  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:50):**  who can't, who don't go to school when they're on their period.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:52):**  So if you can't afford proper period products, then you know, if you haven't got period products,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:59):**  then you would just be bleeding through essentially.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:01):**  So you, if you can't afford those products and you miss school on those days.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:04):**  Okay.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:05):**  So how, sustainability, how long does the cup last?  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:08):**  It's definitely the most sustainable option.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:09):**  I think I have to double check on the thing.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:11):**  I should know this more than three years.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:13):**  So schools could, you could get behind that.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:17):**  So my friend at City to See, Nat, it's a charity there.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:21):**  They kind of got behind their, they started the hashtag plastic free periods.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:25):**  So at the moment schools, there's a new thing, it's amazing schools have said in the UK,  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:29):**  they're going to give free period products to all school kids in primary and secondary  
**[0:15:33-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:33):**  schools in UK, right?  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:34):**  Which is amazing.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:35):**  That is amazing.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:36):**  However, what they, what could be likely to happen would be that they give out a load  
**[0:15:42-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:42):**  of plastic products, right?  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:43):**  So schools have also have the aim that they're going to go plastic free.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:46):**  Like Michael Gove said, all schools are going to go plastic free by 2022 or something.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:51):**  Okay.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:52):**  So not far off.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:53):**  Three years.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:54):**  So it's a chance for them to start giving these free period products out and be given  
**[0:15:56-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:56):**  loads of free plastic period products.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:59):**  So Nat at City to See, they started in jazz, they started a petition to Michael Gove to  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:05):**  make sure he only accepts like tender for the bid for this plastic free periods from  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:09):**  companies that are doing plastic free periods.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:12):**  So hopefully a lot of people have got behind it.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:15):**  We've got loads of school teachers have signed it.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:18):**  I'll share the link on my social feeds.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:20):**  Yeah, that's a good way we can put it in here as well.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:23):**  So hopefully what will happen is that when the schools start giving out the free products  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:28):**  will be that they're giving out, you know, organic cotton tampons, menstrual cups, and  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:32):**  period pants instead of loads of plastic shit.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:36):**  Fingers crossed.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:37):**  Amazing.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:38):**  It is amazing.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:39):**  Where are we at?  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:44):**  We have five minutes, Sophie.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:45):**  Sorry, I have to, where are we at?  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:46):**  So we're about to go for a run together.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:47):**  And we're going to have a little trot together, aren't we?  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:48):**  I'm going to wear shoes.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:49):**  Well, I'm going to do this little five minute radio thing and then we go for a trot.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:54):**  You're going to have some shoes on.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:59):**  I'm going to wear some shoes because, uh, I don't know.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:02):**  Actually I think it's no, it's the guys at Vivo who told me that I shouldn't just go  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:06):**  straight into running like five, 10K barefoot.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:08):**  I should do my like normal 5K and then for the last K like change into barefoot and slowly  
**[0:17:14-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:14):**  change my lifestyle to barefoot.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:15):**  Yeah, that's if you're not being necessarily taught in technique.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:18):**  If you're taught the appropriate technique and posture, rhythm, relaxation and what with  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:23):**  breath work and stuff like that, then you can certainly get yourself to a track and  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:28):**  just get around the track and then do some more drills and then go off again.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:32):**  We're going to do technique when you're back in Hampstead.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:33):**  But for today we'll just have a little play.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:35):**  Well, we can do loads of them back in Hampstead.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:37):**  I don't think we'll be getting in the ponds again.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:38):**  It's going to get colder and colder.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:39):**  I saw you doing a little technique session with Richie actually on his stories.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:42):**  So I copied some of what you've done with him already.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:44):**  He's meeting me.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:45):**  He's coming.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:46):**  He's coming on the 10th.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:47):**  He's going to be a strength temple.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:48):**  So let's just go back to sustainability.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:51):**  So what would you say people can be actioning today?  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:54):**  What are the things they can be doing to be the change and to make a difference in the  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:00):**  world?  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:02):**  So I guess there's like the big ones and the little ones.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:04):**  The littlest things are things like number one, carrying a reusable water bottle everywhere.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:07):**  It's kind of annoying.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:08):**  They're like a clunky thing to carry around.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:09):**  But if you can do that and start saying no to plastic bottles, that's kind of a massive  
**[0:18:13-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:13):**  win in your personal life.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:15):**  I guess the big ones are reducing your meat consumption and eating kind of sustainable  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:19):**  well-sourced meat instead of bad meat from cheap meat from the supermarket.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:25):**  Yeah, industrialized, domesticated, antibiotic fed meat.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:29):**  Number two, it's secondhand September at the moment.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:31):**  So fast fashion is really, really bad for the environment.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:34):**  How do I miss out on these things?  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:35):**  I never know what they are.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:36):**  There's so many of them.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:37):**  Secondhand September.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:38):**  Just only buying secondhand clothes for September.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:39):**  It's also slow fashion season as well.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:41):**  Or don't buy any at all.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:42):**  Don't buy any at all or buy secondhand.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:46):**  And then, yeah, sustainable travel.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:48):**  So seeing if you can do staycations, holidaying locally, trying to reduce your flying.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:53):**  So yeah, for me, those are the kind of big three.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:56):**  If you can reduce your meat consumption, reduce your fast fashion consumption and stop flying  
**[0:19:02-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:02):**  quite as much.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:03):**  It doesn't mean don't fly ever, but just try and cut out the cheap weekends abroad.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:08):**  Brilliant.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:10):**  So if you're on a small scale level, reusable water bowls, try and buy your veg at the market  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:14):**  or Odd Box are doing this great sign up at the moment where you get your first box for  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:18):**  a fiver.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:19):**  Explain Odd Box.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:20):**  Odd Box is a, I haven't had one yet myself.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:23):**  I have the Riverford one, which I think you get too, right?  
**[0:19:25-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:25):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:26):**  I love Riverford.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:27):**  But it's a veg box.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:28):**  Odd Box are the ones that supermarkets only take perfect orange straight carrots and perfect  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:32):**  red round tomatoes.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:33):**  So any that the supermarkets say no to because they're odd shapes or colors, Odd Box go around,

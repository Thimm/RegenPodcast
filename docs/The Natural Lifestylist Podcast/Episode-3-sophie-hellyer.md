### The Natural Lifestylist Podcast  (2019-09-15)  
### Author(s): Tony Riddle  

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:00):**  Hi, I'm Tony Riddle and this is the Natural Lifestylist podcast.  So way back in December I had this crazy idea to run from Land's End to John O'Groats in  just 30 days.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:12):**  But I wasn't just going to run it, I was going to run it barefoot to raise funds for environmental  charities and collaborate with world leading experts to raise awareness and money for six  organisations fighting the top sustainability issues of our time.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:28):**  I knew running barefoot would raise many a socially extreme eyebrow and with that eyebrow  raising behaviour I would be able to provide a perfect platform to highlight the importance  of connecting with our environment and those key sustainability issues of our time.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:44):**  Today I'm joined behind the mic with my rewild, rice fierce, wild swimming, surfing and sustainability  sister.  The one and only Sophie Hellyer.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:00:56):**  To those closer to her, Sophie Hellyer.  Sophie was once a champion surfer at national level.  She co-created the movement Rise Fierce, which inspires women to try cold water swimming,  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:09):**  promoting body neutrality and improving mental and physical health.  Sophie has become a prominent voice on matters of ocean pollution, plastic waste, sustainable  fashion and eco-friendly living.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:23):**  As I'd taken forever to run 20 miles to get to Sophie, this is a brief convo of just 25  minutes.  However, it's potent and we packed in a lot of sustainability magic here.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:35):**  I really do hope you enjoy that magic.  Peace out.  So I'm here with wonderful Sophie.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:43):**  I nearly forgot your name Sophie.  It's 25 miles in today and I'm a bit wiped, but I'm going to hold space because I realised  that part of this commitment to running 30 miles a day was also to hold space for sustainability  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:01:57):**  experts.  I'm going to call Sophie a sustainability expert because I've been following her for  quite some time now.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:02):**  As well as being into wild swimming just like myself and rewilding, there's so much more  to her and I think we all need to hear from Sophie.  It's just a shame we only have about 20 minutes.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:15):**  But welcome Sophie.  Hi.  It's really good to see you.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:19):**  It's great.  I know.  I nearly sobbed on your shoulder.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:23):**  I just needed that female energy to bring me in.  You've got another few miles to go.  So people might know you as a surfer.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:35):**  Yeah, I guess.  It's kind of weird as well.  People ask what I do because I haven't surfed competitively for a long time now and I've  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:44):**  been living in London the last year.  I'm still very attached to the fact I surf and I'm a surfer but it's not really what  I do for a job anymore.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:51):**  Yeah, so that's for people that don't know Sophie.  Hell yeah.  Hell yeah.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:56):**  Hell yeah.  What does Sophie do?  Sophie.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:02:59):**  What does a Sophie do?  I hold women's retreats, cold water swimming, yoga and surfing.  They have an amazing hashtag.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:08):**  What is it?  Rise Fierce.  Rise Fierce.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:11):**  I love that.  We started a women's kind of outdoor wild swimming movement called Rise Fierce.  It did begin about getting up in the morning and being fierce and it became about so much  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:19):**  more about rising up in life to meet whatever challenges you're fronted with.  But yeah, so I run the women's retreats.  I also write for different magazines and newspapers.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:30):**  So I basically use sport as a vehicle to talk about environmental.  Keep going.  Keep going.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:37):**  Keep going.  Environmental and...  I've just got to ditch the chair.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:40):**  I can't cope.  I'm coming down as well.  That's good.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:43):**  We're changing to the spot.  How's the camera level?  Oh, sorry, sorry.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:46):**  Sorry.  There we go.  James is on fire.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:49):**  We're good.  So I write for freelance, different magazines and newspapers and I basically use sport as  a vehicle to talk about different environmental and feminist issues, social issues, I guess.  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:03:58):**  Yeah.  And I do a bit of freelance producing and I do some public speaking and yeah, I get  a different job every week.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:07):**  It is a different job every week.  It seems like that.  If there's someone that follows you, it's like, ah, she's so busy.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:12):**  It's like work, work, work, work, work.  So if we're talking about sustainability, how do you sustain that yourself?  Because we're all into sustainability, but it also needs to be how does Sophie the human  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:22):**  sustain?  Absolutely.  And I really do.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:25):**  I had a bit of a challenging day yesterday.  Someone very close to me lives with quite serious mental health issues and can be really  hard for me to support that sometimes.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:36):**  So I really like for me, the cold water swimming is my, that's my kind of saviour.  Yeah.  Like for me that going in the cold water is like hitting the reset button.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:47):**  It just helps me like completely restart my day, deal with everything.  And the same with if I can't go swimming, then yoga, like finding that space on my mat  and that time is kind of really the me time.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:04:58):**  It's like the water is my church, I guess.  Yeah, it's lovely.  I feel that.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:06):**  It's been my saviour on this run.  It's kind of, we're staying at the moment on this farm and I have a stream and a fire  and I get and sit in the stream and it's just like if there was a sound to it, it would  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:19):**  definitely be, you know, as I put my feet into the water and then I can just feel the  system just starting to just melt away really, which is bizarre because you're in cold water,  right?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:31):**  But it's just, it's that softening.  It's definitely a great space to get into.  Yeah.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:35):**  All right.  So outside the human of Sophie, then let's get, let's get into sustainability.  We're going to smash through it because we've got like a really quick time now.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:42):**  Tony's got an important phone call with the BBC.  I've got a phone call with the BBC.  Plastic free periods.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:50):**  Yeah.  So can we go there?  Because I'm a dad of three girls, right?  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:05:54):**  Yeah, you're going to have to go there.  And I think, and I think these conversations are so important again, like why am I running  this 30 miles a day, 30 consecutive days?  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:02):**  It's because that's what I can do, right?  That's the thing I can give.  And also it's a message for my kids that when I'm older in 20 years time, it's not going  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:10):**  to be, well, what did you, what did you do in the, with this huge decline right now?  Right.  And so I want to be able to educate them in things like plastic free periods.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:18):**  Right.  It's like definitely there.  So, um, I grew up surfing in North Devon and it was a regular occurrence there to see you  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:25):**  sanctuary pads and tampons and condoms kind of floating past you in the sea.  And I've had sanitary pads kind of hit me in the face before when I'm paddling for a  wave.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:34):**  Wonderful.  The plastic tampon applicators as like I did a beach clean actually on the Thames by my  house in London last week.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:41):**  I saw it.  I saw it.  Yeah.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:44):**  I probably found in an hour, I think I found like maybe 40 plastic tampon applicators on  the beach.  Basically anything that goes down the toilet ends up in the rivers or in the sea.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:06:53):**  Um, if not in landfill, I think landfills probably the best place it can go, which is  pretty depressing.  Um, but luckily there are loads of reusable kind of sustainable alternatives to so like  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:06):**  tampons, most tampons have like a lot of them have plastic applicators, but even the ones  that don't contain a thin layer of plastic inside them and they're basically bleach cotton  walls.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:15):**  It's pretty nasty thing to be putting inside yourself.  And sanitary pads contain the same plastic as about four or five plastic carrier bags.  And in the UK, so that's like endocrine disruptors as well.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:25):**  Right.  Um, I have no idea how bad it is for your body, but I'm sure it's pretty bad.  It's totally normalized.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:33):**  And actually the reusable alternatives are not normalized and people think they're kind  of weird and hippie-ish, but which is, I mean, I guess I'm a hippie.  But, um, in the UK, I think it's 2.5 million tampons and 1.5 million million sanitary pads  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:07:52):**  are flushed down the toilet every single day.  That's incredible.  There's a whole lot of kind of plastic just getting flushed down the toilet and most of  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:00):**  it finding its way out into the sea.  Yeah.  And it's so aligned with Surfers Against Sewage who I met.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:04):**  I met Hugo Tag home the other day.  Yes, absolutely.  You two have really been hitting it off.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:07):**  You've been meeting?  I'm going to meet Hugo next week.  Brilliant.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:10):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love Surfers Against Sewage.  So that's where we're, I'm moving down to that area soon.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:15):**  So yeah, it's just such great work.  Yeah, absolutely.  You know, cause really we're talking about what the individual can do right now, right?  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:22):**  Yeah.  So taking control of, like, especially for a woman to be able to take control of her  cycle like that.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:27):**  And I don't know how far in depth to go with it, but if you're starting to, so like one  of the main reusable alternatives is menstrual cups.  So I use one called a moon cup, which is just like a small little silica cup.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:39):**  You basically just fold and pop inside yourself.  It collects the blood for eight hours.  You pop out, empty it, rinse it, reuse it.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:44):**  So you're not flushing it down the toilet and getting rid of it at the end.  You're just reusing this silicon cup for years.  Wow.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:50):**  Well, nothing leaks.  You don't need pads or anything like that with it.  I mean, if you're scared of leakage, then you can leave it in for like up to eight hours  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:08:57):**  as well.  So you don't have to be changing it all the time, which is really useful.  You can also get period pants, which are great, especially for teens.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:04):**  So like when your young girls come into having their periods, period pants are amazing cause  you just put on pants and carry on your day.  And they're growing, are they?  
**[0:09:11-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:11):**  Are they quite common now?  I think they're definitely getting more mainstream and more popular.  There's a couple of brands that make quite, there's like brands like Thinx and Flux are  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:19):**  making like good stylish pants.  And again, that's moving towards organics and sustainable.  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:24):**  But they're using the cup kind of makes you really in tune with your cycle a bit more  cause you're kind of seeing the blood and the color of the blood, the consistency of  the blood and just kind of like, for me, that's the aspect of like the rewarding part.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:37):**  Again, just, it's not this thing that you never see and you flush away.  It's like you're actually getting in tune with what's coming out your body and what's  going on.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:44):**  I think it's so important, isn't it?  Because um, yeah, I think most people lost touch anyway.  You lost touch of a hormonal system.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:51):**  I mean, it's so important, isn't it?  Yeah, totally.  So what about, um, alternatives for contraception then?  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:09:57):**  So I, um, track my cycle.  There's obviously, there's absolutely no one size fits all contraception and you kind of  have to work out what works for you.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:05):**  And I know some people have conditions, they can't use certain things, but I track my cycle.  I take my temperature every morning.  I use an app which, um, I know a lot of, there's, there gets a lot of press, some good and some  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:17):**  bad.  There's an app called natural cycles, um, which works really well for me and my body.  So I have a really regular cycle.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:24):**  Um, I sleep like the same amount every night.  You know, I go to bed at 10 and I wake up at six and so for me with a regular lifestyle,  it really fits.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:32):**  I just take my temperature every morning.  I put it in the app and the algorithm basically tells me whether I'm on a green day or a red  day.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:38):**  And if you're on a red day, it means that you use, if you're having sex and you're not  looking to conceive, then you just use other contraception.  So on a red day we would either use condoms or yeah.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:50):**  So I have been off of the pill for about, God, I was on the pill from when I was 15  for a decade.  So 10 years on the contraceptive pill.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:10:59):**  Um, wreaking havoc on the hormonal system.  Yeah.  Which again, I mean for some people the pills amazing and some people it really works.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:06):**  But for me, like that was a really challenging time for me in my life when I had, I was experiencing  depression and I'm not sure what effect my hormones had and all of that as well.  So it felt really good to kind of come off of it and embrace the natural thing a little  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:22):**  bit more.  It definitely suits my lifestyle better.  Well, it is getting back into rewilding again, isn't it?  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:26):**  And I guess if you worked with that and you're working with your cycle, you have so much  more in tune, aren't you?  Yeah, it's just, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:33):**  It's a kind of a delicate thing to talk about.  I know a lot of people, whenever I talk about tracking my cycle the natural way, I get a  lot of pushback and a lot of people kind of speaking up against it.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:44):**  It seems to be the thing that people want to police the most in a way.  Like people aren't very happy to hear that you're embracing your cycle and tracking it  naturally like.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:11:52):**  Yeah, but okay, but what's the stats on how successful that is compared to?  Um, so the app I use is FDA approved contraception.  Um, and it's in the same effectiveness category as a contraceptive pill and it's more effective  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:07):**  than condoms.  So do we know what the sentries are on condoms?  Do we know that?  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:12):**  I don't know off the top of my head, but I think condoms are like in high 80s.  I don't want to say the exact stats you have to do.  You can find it on a quick Google, but the pill and the app with like with normal use  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:26):**  or whatever in the mid nineties.  And then I think the IUD, like the coil is the highest one.  Yeah.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:33):**  But you know, people say like, tracking your cycle the natural way is bad.  With the coil and it's created lots of stagnation and they get a lot of mechanical back pain.  So there's other stuff that comes through with that.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:45):**  Yeah.  I know a few of my friends have had them fit and had a bad experience, but I'm sure for  every bad experience, it's a good experience.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:52):**  Yeah.  Hmm.  I just, yeah, the, it's interesting.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:12:57):**  Whenever I talk about tracking my cycle, the natural way, someone will always come up and  go, Oh, my friend's got pregnant doing that.  But I'm sure a lot of people's friends have also got pregnant using condoms and on the  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:05):**  pill, but for some reason you never get the bite back if you're taught like the, the,  yeah, because you're seen as this stage, it's seen again as socially extreme.  Yeah.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:15):**  Even though it's perfectly normal.  Yeah.  Right.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:18):**  And it's been like that forever.  Right.  Obviously not using temperature, but other means.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:22):**  Yeah.  It's so good, Sophie, because I was, I was hit by a question on a podcast.  I think it was wandering into, wandering into wild, wandering into wildness, wildness into  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:33):**  wondering and somewhere through the podcast, the woman said to me, just because it's my  field, I think I just want to ask you, what are you going to teach?  What are you going to teach your children around their cycle?  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:46):**  And I was, and it was so out of context because we were off on some kind of on another journey.  Yeah.  And I was a bit like, um, um, I guess Katarina's going to have that conversation with them,  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:13:57):**  which I would expect, which seems perfectly normal to me that it would be the mum that  would be in that.  And I think it's also important for dads to have an understanding of it totally, you know,  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:06):**  to be involved and to help celebrate it.  The same as what I said, if I had a son that, you know, I'm going to create like a real  rite of passage around his voice breaking.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:15):**  Yeah.  You know, and for Lola and Millie, again, I want to create a ceremony or a celebration  for them to honor it.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:22):**  So much like shame and stigma attached around periods.  And yeah, absolutely.  Like what if when you got your first period, you threw a little party and you were like,  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:30):**  celebrate it as opposed to like hiding and thinking it's this dirty thing.  And I think that addressing that shame around it and kind of breaking period taboos is the  first stage to addressing like period poverty.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:42):**  Other things like FGM still going on in the UK and around the world.  What's period poverty?  Period poverty is basically loads of girls and women in the UK and all over the world  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:14:50):**  who can't, who don't go to school when they're on their period.  So if you can't afford proper period products, then you know, if you haven't got period products,  then you would just be bleeding through essentially.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:01):**  So you, if you can't afford those products and you miss school on those days.  Okay.  So how, sustainability, how long does the cup last?  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:08):**  It's definitely the most sustainable option.  I think I have to double check on the thing.  I should know this more than three years.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:13):**  So schools could, you could get behind that.  So my friend at City to See, Nat, it's a charity there.  They kind of got behind their, they started the hashtag plastic free periods.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:25):**  So at the moment schools, there's a new thing, it's amazing schools have said in the UK,  they're going to give free period products to all school kids in primary and secondary  schools in UK, right?  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:34):**  Which is amazing.  That is amazing.  However, what they, what could be likely to happen would be that they give out a load  
**[0:15:42-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:42):**  of plastic products, right?  So schools have also have the aim that they're going to go plastic free.  Like Michael Gove said, all schools are going to go plastic free by 2022 or something.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:51):**  Okay.  So not far off.  Three years.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:15:54):**  So it's a chance for them to start giving these free period products out and be given  loads of free plastic period products.  So Nat at City to See, they started in jazz, they started a petition to Michael Gove to  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:05):**  make sure he only accepts like tender for the bid for this plastic free periods from  companies that are doing plastic free periods.  So hopefully a lot of people have got behind it.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:15):**  We've got loads of school teachers have signed it.  I'll share the link on my social feeds.  Yeah, that's a good way we can put it in here as well.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:22):**  Yeah.  So hopefully what will happen is that when the schools start giving out the free products  will be that they're giving out, you know, organic cotton tampons, menstrual cups, and  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:32):**  period pants instead of loads of plastic shit.  Yeah.  Fingers crossed.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:37):**  Amazing.  It is amazing.  Where are we at?  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:44):**  We have five minutes, Sophie.  Sorry, I have to, where are we at?  So we're about to go for a run together.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:47):**  And we're going to have a little trot together, aren't we?  I'm going to wear shoes.  Well, I'm going to do this little five minute radio thing and then we go for a trot.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:16:54):**  You're going to have some shoes on.  I'm going to wear some shoes because, uh, I don't know.  Actually I think it's no, it's the guys at Vivo who told me that I shouldn't just go  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:06):**  straight into running like five, 10K barefoot.  I should do my like normal 5K and then for the last K like change into barefoot and slowly  change my lifestyle to barefoot.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:15):**  Yeah, that's if you're not being necessarily taught in technique.  If you're taught the appropriate technique and posture, rhythm, relaxation and what with  breath work and stuff like that, then you can certainly get yourself to a track and  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:28):**  just get around the track and then do some more drills and then go off again.  We're going to do technique when you're back in Hampstead.  But for today we'll just have a little play.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:35):**  Well, we can do loads of them back in Hampstead.  I don't think we'll be getting in the ponds again.  It's going to get colder and colder.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:39):**  I saw you doing a little technique session with Richie actually on his stories.  So I copied some of what you've done with him already.  He's meeting me.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:45):**  He's coming.  He's coming on the 10th.  He's going to be a strength temple.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:17:48):**  So let's just go back to sustainability.  So what would you say people can be actioning today?  What are the things they can be doing to be the change and to make a difference in the  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:00):**  world?  Yeah.  So I guess there's like the big ones and the little ones.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:04):**  The littlest things are things like number one, carrying a reusable water bottle everywhere.  It's kind of annoying.  They're like a clunky thing to carry around.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:09):**  But if you can do that and start saying no to plastic bottles, that's kind of a massive  win in your personal life.  I guess the big ones are reducing your meat consumption and eating kind of sustainable  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:19):**  well-sourced meat instead of bad meat from cheap meat from the supermarket.  Yeah, industrialized, domesticated, antibiotic fed meat.  Number two, it's secondhand September at the moment.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:31):**  So fast fashion is really, really bad for the environment.  How do I miss out on these things?  I never know what they are.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:36):**  There's so many of them.  Secondhand September.  Just only buying secondhand clothes for September.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:39):**  It's also slow fashion season as well.  Or don't buy any at all.  Don't buy any at all or buy secondhand.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:46):**  And then, yeah, sustainable travel.  So seeing if you can do staycations, holidaying locally, trying to reduce your flying.  So yeah, for me, those are the kind of big three.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:18:56):**  If you can reduce your meat consumption, reduce your fast fashion consumption and stop flying  quite as much.  It doesn't mean don't fly ever, but just try and cut out the cheap weekends abroad.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:08):**  Brilliant.  Yeah.  So if you're on a small scale level, reusable water bowls, try and buy your veg at the market  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:14):**  or Odd Box are doing this great sign up at the moment where you get your first box for  a fiver.  Explain Odd Box.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:20):**  Odd Box is a, I haven't had one yet myself.  I have the Riverford one, which I think you get too, right?  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:26):**  I love Riverford.  But it's a veg box.  Odd Box are the ones that supermarkets only take perfect orange straight carrots and perfect  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:32):**  red round tomatoes.  So any that the supermarkets say no to because they're odd shapes or colors, Odd Box go around,  collect them all up and then send them out.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:38):**  So you're kind of getting perfectly good veg that's a slightly odd shape.  There we go.  Yeah.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:43):**  So there are a few things there.  Yeah.  A few things to make the difference, make the change.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:49):**  Thank you, Sophie.  No worries.  You're wonderful.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:19:52):**  And if you're a person who has periods, try some reusables.  Try some reusables.  There we go.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-3-Sophie-Hellyer-e5coqi#t=0:20:01):**  Wow.  So that was a punchy conversation.  Short, sweet, but delivering everything it needed to.

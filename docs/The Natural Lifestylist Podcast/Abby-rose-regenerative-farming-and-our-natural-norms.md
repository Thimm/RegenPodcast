**[0:02:00-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:02:00):**  hyper focused mofo mode for the crazy one man, two feet, three peaks endurance event.

**[0:02:14-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:02:14):**  I hit a massive come down and had to go into save my own ass mode, which also involved  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:02:21):**  the whole riddle tribe moving out of London and out into the country.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:02:25):**  So one could say I somewhat dropped the ball on this podcast.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:02:30):**  So apologies to the wonderful Abby and all those that have waited.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:02:35):**  But in keeping with my flow don't push philosophy, I dare say this will of course be just the  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:02:41):**  right time to drop the mic.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:02:44):**  Now there has been lots of talk recently on the new norm, but as far as I'm concerned,  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:02:48):**  the only new norm we should be moving towards is actually the natural norm, which ain't  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:02:53):**  that new really is it?  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:02:55):**  And I have to thank Abby because Abby is seriously, this conversation has certainly helped me  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:03:00):**  better understand and articulate my message around the natural food norm.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:03:05):**  You see, it takes a huge amount of skill in our modern industrialized world of convenience,  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:03:11):**  I say, to get our fundamental needs met.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:03:14):**  That's pretty inconvenient in this modern world.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:03:17):**  And I hope this conversation will help you refine your food filter and make that path  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:03:22):**  or that journey a little easier to understand.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:03:25):**  But before we get going, here's a little intel on the wonderful Abby Rose.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:03:30):**  Abby Rose is the co-creator and co-host of Phanarama, a platform for the regenerative

**[0:03:41-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:03:41):**  Abby is also the co-founder of Vida cycle apps, where they create digital tools to build  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:03:51):**  ecology, profitability, and beauty on farms around the world.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:03:57):**  Their tech tools are built to support a paradigm shift towards regenerative farming, where

**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:06):**  Now I really hope you enjoy this chat.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:08):**  I learned a hell of a lot from Abby, as I've said.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:12):**  And I feel to be honest, I feel like it's just a teaser.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:15):**  It's just the start.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:16):**  And I hope I get to do this again.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:19):**  Enjoy the conversation.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:23):**  So we're rolling out.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:24):**  So welcome to the Natural Istarlist podcast.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:27):**  Great to have you on here.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:28):**  This is I mean, this has been in the making.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:30):**  Couple that didn't quite make it but you know, we're in lockdown right now.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:34):**  What do we expect?  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:36):**  We're breaking free of it, should we say?  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:40):**  Stepping into something new, hopefully something new.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:43):**  Hopefully the old paradigm.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:46):**  So Abby, I'm so happy you're on.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:48):**  Yeah, total pleasure to be here.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:51):**  Thanks for joining the pod.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:55):**  So I know Abby Rose.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:56):**  And of course, I've done my research on Abby Rose.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:04:58):**  But for those for those that don't know, I mean, how do you mean it's a bit of a unique  
**[0:05:01-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:05:01):**  path reading, which is interesting to say unique path considering it was the norm, right?  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:05:08):**  But now it's a unique path.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:05:10):**  So Abby, I guess for the listeners, just a little bit of backstory.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:05:14):**  How do we get to this unique path and this fear that you're operating in now?  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:05:20):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:05:21):**  So yeah, the farming sphere, which I agree today seems sort of unusual or unique, but  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:05:28):**  just back in the day or not that long ago would have been more the norm.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:05:33):**  So and just to be clear, I have to say I didn't start my life being interested in farming  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:05:38):**  by any means, certainly for the first 20 odd years of my life.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:05:42):**  I kind of...  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:05:43):**  But that's great Abby, we definitely want that backstory or love that backstory.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:05:47):**  Yeah, no, I was gonna say I embarrassingly kind of thought farming was a bit boring and  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:05:53):**  backwards and just something that really wasn't part of our futures.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:05:59):**  And I even, you know, I grew up in Manchester or in the outskirts of Manchester on the edge  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:02):**  of the Pennines.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:03):**  And so I grew up surrounded by farmland.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:05):**  And I just remember thinking like, why do people have these cows and sheep and it just  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:09):**  seemed so like monotonous and not interesting.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:14):**  And yeah, now I'm fascinated by those fields.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:18):**  But how did I, you know, why that transformation?  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:22):**  And really, it all started when my parents actually moved.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:27):**  They actually moved from Cheshire to Chile and started farming there.

**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:37):**  So they moved to a part of the world which had a very similar climate to California.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:41):**  I'm so pleased you said that Abby because I was trying to get the accent and it was  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:46):**  like, well Manchester, I've never heard anyone from Manchester with this accent before.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:50):**  Totally.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:51):**  Yeah, it's very confusing.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:52):**  But yeah, it's a decoy.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:53):**  I am actually totally British born and bred.  
**[0:06:57-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:57):**  I've never lived anywhere else officially.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:06:59):**  So yeah, so my parents moved to Chile.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:07:03):**  And you know, they had the why did they move to Chile and start farming?  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:07:07):**  It's they had actually, you know, I've been eating organic food my whole life, it's always  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:07:12):**  been a priority for them.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:07:14):**  And I think they came to the realization before me that, you know, where does the organic  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:07:19):**  food come from?  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:07:20):**  It comes from food from farms and from the soil.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:07:24):**  And that to really get to the root of health and quality of life.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:07:29):**  That farming, you know, going into farming is at the root of that.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:07:33):**  And so that was really their journey and why they were excited about being back being on  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:07:38):**  the land.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:07:40):**  And so yeah, I started to go visit the farm.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:07:44):**  Our farm is called Vida cycle.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:07:46):**  So like life cycle, but the first half in Spanish.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:07:50):**  Yeah, and it's all you know, we have olives and almonds and pistachios.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:07:57):**  And we graze sheep in between the trees.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:01):**  And we also have loads of fruits and nuts, sorry, fruits and vegetables that we kind  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:07):**  of sell locally in the local farming market.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:10):**  And then we also make a natural wine and a verju which is very juice like lemon juice,  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:16):**  but made from green grapes.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:19):**  And we sell both of those in the UK.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:23):**  I think I saw a bottle of that sneaking into Fran Bailey's Instagram.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:27):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:28):**  I think so.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:29):**  Yeah, she's sort of become obsessed by it now.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:32):**  It's the natural wine world is one of those things that I mean, I wasn't even into wine  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:36):**  before.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:37):**  But when you get into natural wine, you sort of it's a bit like, I don't know, you know,  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:41):**  the more you get into the flavors, it's pretty becomes addictive.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:45):**  But anyway, that's a whole other story.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:47):**  No, I think we will go I think we're unpacked that bit later because I'm Yeah, I have a  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:52):**  friend that has a vineyard and he went by dynamic basically.  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:57):**  Cool.  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:58):**  In that in that process.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:08:59):**  It'd be good to tap into a little bit of that later.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:09:02):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:09:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:09:04):**  And I think that's something I should say is that our farm in Chile, we say we're like,  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:09:09):**  beyond organic or regenerative.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:09:12):**  And so we're regenerative farming.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:09:14):**  And that's really farming by observing the natural processes around us and working with  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:09:20):**  them, rather than trying to control them.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:09:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:09:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:09:25):**  So I have to say farming is also you know, it's it's can seem all like, nice and fluffy,  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:09:33):**  but it's also extremely challenging.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:09:36):**  And one of the realizations and one of the reasons I guess I really started to kind of  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:09:40):**  commit my whole life to farming and to sharing the voices of the farming community and getting  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:09:46):**  people more involved in farming is that it's incredibly challenging.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:09:51):**  Like in 2017, we there were super fires in Chile, similar to the ones that have been  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:09:58):**  happening in Australia and in California in the last few years.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:03):**  And our whole farm burned.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:04):**  I was there at the time.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:08):**  And so everything was gone.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:11):**  Even our water systems, you know, they all just went up in flames and dissolved.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:16):**  So we, to be Yeah, the buildings were saved was the only thing the local fire people saved  
**[0:10:23-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:23):**  the buildings.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:24):**  But, you know, in those moments, you kind of have to reassess and you just realize what  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:31):**  a risky undertaking farming is.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:36):**  And that farmers really are on the front line of the climate crisis.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:39):**  But it's also all in, isn't it?  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:42):**  It's like an all in approach, especially in this instance where you could lose literally  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:46):**  everything.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:47):**  Yeah, yeah, totally, totally.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:48):**  And, yeah, so I think being on the front line of the climate crisis, you do start to rethink  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:56):**  your practices and how you're doing everything.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:10:58):**  And now, you know, it was only since that fire that I was able to convince my dad to  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:11:02):**  get sheep on the farm.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:11:04):**  And so we use the sheep to graze and to build soil health on the farm really in order to  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:11:11):**  have more water and moisture on the farm for longer through the season.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:11:15):**  But yeah, so, so yeah, so it was realizing that farmers are the key decision makers of  
**[0:11:21-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:11:21):**  our future, you know, is what they, the way we decide to farm on our land actually impacts  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:11:29):**  everyone around us and potentially everyone on the globe in terms of, you know, the way  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:11:35):**  we graze those sheep can affect how much carbon is sequestered in the soil.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:11:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:11:41):**  And that's like that conversation around holistic management and moving.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:11:45):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:11:46):**  So, yeah, we can dig into that in a bit.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:11:50):**  And through all of that, I became quite obsessed with the soil and I have a background in physics.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:11:55):**  So I started making apps initially for our farm to help us monitor our soil and also  
**[0:12:02-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:12:02):**  to monitor our trees.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:12:04):**  And that's actually what I spend most of my time doing these days.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:12:07):**  I only spend two months of the year on the farm in Chile and the rest of the year I'm  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:12:11):**  based in the UK.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:12:13):**  And we, yeah, I work with many farmers across the UK and the US.

**[0:12:24-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:12:24):**  And it's really all about empowering farmers, returning agency to the farm and allowing  
**[0:12:31-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:12:31):**  them to go and observe their soils and then learn from those observations and then go  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:12:38):**  and experiment, see how they can build soil health and then come back and see what's changed  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:12:42):**  in the soil.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:12:43):**  I love that.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:12:44):**  Do you know what it feels like to me Abi?  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:12:45):**  It's almost like a conversation between, you know, we had that, we had a wild period, right?  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:12:49):**  So we're like sations and then we move in, migrate into farming.  
**[0:12:53-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:12:53):**  So there would have been a, almost a pre agricultural then agricultural nature where there was that  
**[0:13:01-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:01):**  information about the soil.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:02):**  People understood the soil, let's say, because they were still part of it.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:07):**  Whereas now the interesting things we can, as you were saying, we can now use tech to  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:11):**  step in as that wild human almost to assess what's happening with the soil.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:15):**  Agreed.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:16):**  And to plant the wisdom in that way, because they were like wisdom keepers, right?  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:20):**  Around the land and the soil and how to find water and what was fertile.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:24):**  Okay.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:25):**  Brilliant.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:26):**  Totally.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:27):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:29):**  No, it's all about that.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:30):**  It's all about, yeah, reconnecting and the power of observation to build wisdom essentially  
**[0:13:35-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:35):**  and allowing technology to support you in that.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:38):**  So yeah, I think, and we've also make apps for vineyards and for agroforestry or trees  
**[0:13:44-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:44):**  and all of our apps focus on observation and building that wisdom for yourself and on that  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:51):**  piece of specifically your land.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:55):**  Not just in the general abstract, what is good farming, but what is good farming and  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:13:59):**  this specific piece of land?  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:14:01):**  Because it is different for every single case.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:14:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:14:04):**  And I guess what else goes into that individual case of the soil is everything, isn't it?  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:14:08):**  It's like the farmer's DNA, their emotions, everything.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:14:11):**  That's why it's such an individual effort in that sense.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:14:16):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:14:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:14:18):**  And so I guess the final thing to say is that the other part of that evolution was realizing  
**[0:14:23-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:14:23):**  also that farmers, when you're farming, you're so remote and removed from other farmers.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:14:30):**  And so knowledge sharing is actually quite difficult.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:14:34):**  And so on that journey, as I kind of became more immersed in the UK farming community,  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:14:40):**  I really realized that people were already doing amazing work, but it just wasn't being  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:14:45):**  shared and heard that well.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:14:49):**  And so I had some experience in podcasting tech for good, creating podcasts about technology  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:14:55):**  for good.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:14:56):**  And so I worked together with the podcast editor, Joe, and we created Farmerama Radio,  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:15:05):**  which is really a community led initiative to share the voices of the farmers doing things  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:15:11):**  differently and of the people who are behind this regenerative farming movement.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:15:16):**  What experiments are they doing?  
**[0:15:18-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:15:18):**  What ideas do they have?  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:15:21):**  And it's just seeding the idea in other farmers' heads of like, oh, I could try that or, oh,  
**[0:15:27-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:15:27):**  they've already tried that and that didn't work.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:15:29):**  Okay, let's not do that.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:15:31):**  Yes.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:15:32):**  So it's all sharing all of that.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:15:33):**  And what I didn't expect, but what's happened is that actually we get a lot of people tuning  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:15:38):**  in who are not farmers at all, but they're interested in farming or they're interested  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:15:42):**  in food or like, you know, interested in rewilding themselves.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:15:47):**  And so they want to understand what is behind all of this and what are people talking about  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:15:51):**  and thinking about who are the people who are actually interacting with the land.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:15:56):**  And so, yeah, Farmerama Radio is, it's really exciting.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:15:59):**  And I'd say it sounds amazing.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:16:01):**  Because it's, as you say, it's building that community, but that community then outstretched  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:16:06):**  is just farming.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:16:08):**  Oh, yeah, totally.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:16:09):**  You know, because we really went down the rabbit hole.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:16:11):**  I mean, everyone should have their concerns in this, right?  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:16:14):**  As we're going to over the conversation, you know?  
**[0:16:17-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:16:17):**  Yeah, totally.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:16:18):**  And I think our latest, we did a six part series called Cereal with a C, so C-E-R-E-A-L.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:16:26):**  And that was all about the food system, food and farming system, particularly in the UK,  
**[0:16:34-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:16:34):**  but it was through the lens of bread.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:16:35):**  So you know, bread is something that everyone can identify with.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:16:40):**  And you know, a lot of people choose to be gluten free or have a somewhat difficult relationship  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:16:45):**  with bread, certainly in today.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:16:48):**  And so what the series is about is about, you know, what is behind this like, change  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:16:55):**  in health status of bread for humans and what, and we go back to the breeding of the grains  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:17:01):**  and also how people are farming it and how it's being milled and baked.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:17:06):**  And at every stage, there are, it just becomes very clear why, you know, how our bread system  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:17:12):**  has actually become really skewed away from nourishing human beings.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:17:18):**  Yes, how it's compromised.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:17:21):**  Yeah, totally compromised and is compromising the land and humans.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:17:26):**  And so, you know, those are the kind of stories that actually everyone can listen to and learn  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:17:31):**  something from and get on board with.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:17:32):**  So that's certainly been popular.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:17:35):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:17:36):**  I guess, you know, it stretches way beyond that, doesn't it, with the soil and just,  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:17:41):**  I mean, gluten is a big one now, isn't it?  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:17:46):**  But I mean, we're talking about almost anything that's grown in the soil.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:17:49):**  And it was, it's, it's, it's bizarre, isn't it?  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:17:52):**  Because we know that, you know, this is regenerative conversation, as we've said, it goes all the  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:17:58):**  way, it goes all the way back to wild humans and wild humans understanding the earth and  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:01):**  then through agriculture.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:04):**  But yet, it seems like a very new conversation, you know, and it reminds me of where we were

**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:17):**  table.

**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:21):**  Why is it only now, Abby?

**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:26):**  I mean, partly, I guess you've already answered that in some of the work you're doing, which  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:29):**  helps grow the community.

**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:32):**  Why not earlier?  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:34):**  Is it because of the allergies?  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:37):**  Is it because of, you know, it's just, I just find it interesting that, again, it's a rewilding  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:41):**  process, like rewilding that we only now hear about rewilding, you know, and really, it's  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:46):**  just when you understand it and you're in it, it's always surprising because it's such  
**[0:18:49-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:49):**  common sense.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:50):**  Totally.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:51):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:52):**  No, I agree.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:53):**  It is regenerative farming in a way is common sense.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:18:58):**  But the reason I think, in a way, I think the serial series does actually lay this out  
**[0:19:03-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:19:03):**  very clearly.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:19:04):**  Like, I, I just think that we've come to the end of a certain type of logic of how the  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:19:11):**  world works.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:19:13):**  So, you know, everyone, literally just five years ago, in the farming community, it was  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:19:21):**  up, you know, everyone was talking about the only way to build a farming business and to  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:19:26):**  be forward thinking was to scale up.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:19:29):**  You know, and if you weren't looking for economies of scale in your business, then you weren't  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:19:35):**  going to survive as a farm going forward.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:19:40):**  And nowadays that that conversation has just disappeared.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:19:44):**  I mean, not for everyone, but literally within this five to seven year timeframe, it's gone.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:19:51):**  And so I think, you know, what happened, the thing with farming is it's so linked to everything.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:19:58):**  So you know, globally, the markets for like wheat prices, for example, crashed.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:20:05):**  I think it was in 2013.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:20:07):**  And they've never come back up again.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:20:09):**  So many farmers today are, you know, you see all these fields of wheat around the UK.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:20:15):**  But those fields of wheat, they're actually spending more to grow that wheat, then they  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:20:21):**  can make selling it.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:20:23):**  So they're, you know, growing wheat at a loss.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:20:27):**  And it's just...  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:20:28):**  Imagine how demoralising that is.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:20:30):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:20:32):**  Right.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:20:33):**  And that's, you know, and that's not uncommon across many different food types.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:20:37):**  And then there's also the policy change that's coming.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:20:42):**  So with Brexit and leaving the EU, that means that in a way, it's a great opportunity in  
**[0:20:48-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:20:48):**  the farming world, because we are able to suddenly decide how subsidies are dealt out  
**[0:20:57-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:20:57):**  to the farming community.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:00):**  And you know that the government's thinking about that right now.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:03):**  And in some ways, it's looking good.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:05):**  They're talking about public money for public goods and supporting more environmental, environmentally  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:10):**  sound farming.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:13):**  But like, I guess you can see from a farmer's perspective, suddenly, they're in a very unknown  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:19):**  position, and they really don't know how they're going to get their income going forward, because,  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:25):**  you know, 60% of income on UK farms is from subsidies.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:31):**  It's crazy, isn't it?  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:33):**  And you know, again, it's like, why don't we know about that?  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:37):**  Why isn't that mainstream press because we're all impacted by that?  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:40):**  Totally.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:41):**  It's, it is like, it's a really bleak thing.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:44):**  It's flabbergasted, isn't it?  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:48):**  But I guess what I'm saying is, like, it's really reached a low point.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:55):**  And I don't think it can go much lower.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:21:58):**  And so all of that thinking, the paradigm, the mindset before that was about like, yields  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:22:06):**  and scale and productivity, not profitability, and then we were just all, you know, subsidies  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:22:12):**  were kind of covering it all up in a way you could say, you know, that's coming to an end.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:22:18):**  And so people are, and farmers are thinking differently.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:22:22):**  They're asking different questions.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:22:24):**  And what's amazing is just at that time, the regenerative farming movement is really gaining  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:22:28):**  ground in the United States as well.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:22:32):**  So yeah, United States, Australia, New Zealand, it's gaining ground traction everywhere.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:22:38):**  And so that's really exciting, because it's come kind of at the right time in the UK.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:22:43):**  And so, so many farmers are asking questions about how can I be more regenerative in my  
**[0:22:48-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:22:48):**  approach?  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:22:49):**  Or how can I build soil health and biodiversity on my farm?  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:22:53):**  Yeah, and is there a template for that?  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:22:58):**  I mean, how do we understand?  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:22:59):**  I mean, if I look at a human being and I want to find natural ways of living, you know,  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:23:04):**  I have to go to the wild tribes of today, or at least tribes that are still connected  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:23:09):**  with the natural way of living to understand what it is to be human.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:23:13):**  And so what's the template?  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:23:16):**  What's the template for soil?  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:23:18):**  I know you said it's almost individual puffs with each farm, but how do you get to that?  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:23:24):**  What is the original template?  
**[0:23:26-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:23:26):**  And how do we?  
**[0:23:29-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:23:29):**  Yeah, I think...  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:23:31):**  Is there a, you know, how do we get there?  
**[0:23:33-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:23:33):**  I think is the conversation, isn't it?  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:23:36):**  Totally, totally.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:23:38):**  I think, well, in a way you could say that farming is inherently, it's an intervention,  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:23:50):**  right?  
**[0:23:52-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:23:52):**  So inherently, in a way, maybe there is no natural template for farming, because it's  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:24:00):**  always a balance between the human interference and the natural world.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:24:06):**  And, you know, we're looking to produce at a larger scale or with more efficiency, you  
**[0:24:14-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:24:14):**  could say, or maybe that's not the right word, but we're trying to feed more people off a

**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:24:26):**  Or we, yeah, I mean, obviously you grow in the rainforest and probably there is a huge  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:24:30):**  density of nutrition.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:24:33):**  So we, but not everywhere is rainforest.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:24:37):**  But I would say that if I was to look at a template for what could really healthy soil  
**[0:24:44-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:24:44):**  look like, we would look to the native forests in the UK.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:24:51):**  Because, you know, when you go into a forest and you can like, it just, it like smells  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:24:57):**  of this like amazing...  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:25:01):**  I don't know, probably people just think it's like earthy, like an earthy sweetness, or  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:25:07):**  certainly if you touch, if you pick up the soil, it does.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:25:11):**  Maybe not everyone's done that.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:25:13):**  But, and that is like, there's lots of fungi in that soil, essentially.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:25:19):**  And the soil, you know, it's really squishy underfoot.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:25:23):**  You know, when the soil feels soft, and you could just put your hand in and dig soil out  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:25:29):**  and there's no resistance, you don't certainly don't need like a serious spade to get into  
**[0:25:35-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:25:35):**  that soil.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:25:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:25:37):**  So it's really amazing.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:25:39):**  And I think that the template somewhat is that.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:25:47):**  But on the other hand, you know, if you wanted to grow, if you want to grow wheat, you can't  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:25:52):**  have forest soils.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:25:54):**  It's not going to work.  
**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:25:57):**  So yeah, I think it really is.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:25:59):**  Okay, so the soil is literally crop specific then in that sense?  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:26:04):**  Yeah, to a certain extent, yes.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:26:06):**  Because if you think about...  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:26:07):**  This is really sophisticated, isn't it?  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:26:11):**  Okay, wow, I mean, imagine that.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:26:15):**  It's about like bacteria and fungi in the soil, basically.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:26:18):**  And you find in a wheat based, in a wheat soil where wheat has been grown year in year  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:26:22):**  out, there's a lot more bacteria, the bacterial ratio is higher.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:26:26):**  Whereas if you go into a forest, there's a lot more fungi in the soil.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:26:30):**  So yeah, it's like every single plant is in communication and in relationship with this  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:26:38):**  microbial life that's below ground.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:26:42):**  And so whatever plants you have in the soil is going to affect the microbial life below  
**[0:26:46-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:26:46):**  ground in exactly the same way that whatever you eat is going to affect the microbiome  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:26:53):**  in your gut, like what bacteria show up in your gut is affected by what you eat, essentially.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:26:59):**  Or that's my understanding.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:00):**  And that's a byproduct of what's grown.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:02):**  So it's the soil, the food, the food, the microbiome.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:06):**  That's a question of complete diversity, isn't it?  
**[0:27:10-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:10):**  Totally, yeah.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:11):**  So I think that is...  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:13):**  So if I was to...  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:16):**  And the more diverse the species, it's suggested, the more, you know, the heightened the emotional  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:21):**  wellbeing of the humans.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:23):**  That must be the same for...  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:26):**  Well, it's the whole ecosystem then, isn't it?  
**[0:27:29-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:29):**  Yeah, it is.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:30):**  And you're so right.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:31):**  So that's exactly what it is.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:33):**  If I was to say there's any template or anything that we're like working towards at all times,  
**[0:27:38-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:38):**  it's increased diversity.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:40):**  Like the more you can increase the diversity, the more resilient your whole farming system  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:48):**  will be.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:50):**  And if we do look into the natural environments, like, you know, the diversity levels are insane  
**[0:27:56-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:56):**  generally.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:58-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:27:59):**  Species diversity on every level.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:00):**  Yes.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:01):**  Every level.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:03):**  So if we were to...  
**[0:28:04-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:04):**  So if we've discussed that, so then if we think about, well, mono cropping is like the  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:06):**  complete opposite of diversity then, isn't it?  
**[0:28:10-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:10):**  Exactly.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:11):**  So even with...  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:12):**  So with wheat production, so if we say, how many years are you saying that we keep producing  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:17):**  wheat in one particular field and that the soil is specific for the wheat, is that part  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:23):**  of the problem why we're also seeing, you know, issues with gluten, intolerances that  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:29):**  come through wheat?  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:31):**  Is it because possibly that the wheat that's being grown, which is still a mono crop in  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:36):**  that sense, is it?  
**[0:28:37-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:37):**  Is it still?  
**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:39):**  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:40):**  We keep taking the same nutrients from the soil the whole time, so then the soil ends  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:43):**  up depleted.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:44):**  But anything else?  
**[0:28:46-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:46):**  Exactly.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:47):**  So how do we...  
**[0:28:48-0:28:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:48):**  Abby, so how do they then recycle the wheat if it's always grown in the same soil?  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:28:59):**  So for people who do grow wheat, year in, year out, which that's impossible to do organically,  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:29:04):**  but you can do that chemically.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:29:08):**  You just apply nitrogen, potassium, phosphate, year in, year out.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:29:14):**  And what's interesting is that when you see those plants and you look at their roots,  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:29:18):**  they have almost no relationship to the soil.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:29:22):**  So the soil is just a substrate in that situation.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:29:26):**  And that's where you start to like come up with this idea of dirt, right?  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:29:30):**  Because it is just, it's literally just a material that helps hold the plant up right  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:29:35):**  basically.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:29:36):**  There is no communication going on.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:29:40):**  There's very, very thwarted communication going on between the soil and the plant.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:29:45):**  And there's hardly any microbes in there.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:29:47):**  And actually what happens is that you get this overpopulation of a certain microbe that  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:29:52):**  then becomes a pathogen essentially.

**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:29:59):**  kill the pathogens.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:00):**  Oh, and then, yeah, and then we go deep and then you consume that.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:04):**  And then what's that doing then to that diversity of your gut?  
**[0:30:07-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:07):**  I mean, it's like...  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:09):**  Exactly.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:11):**  And I think...  
**[0:30:12-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:12):**  If you had a diet based on, well, the terrifying thing is the breads and the pastas and that  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:18):**  was your nutrients.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:19):**  And the expectation was you were going to gain what you would have gained 4,000 years  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:24):**  ago, 5,000 years ago.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:26):**  Well, let's even just think of, let food be thy medicine, you know?  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:32):**  It's not let food be thy medicine.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:34):**  It's let soil be thy medicine in this conversation, isn't it?  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:37):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:38):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:39):**  And then the other thing is about the soil.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:42):**  And maybe I should talk a little bit...  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:43):**  I don't know how much do you want to go into, like, just so people can get a picture of  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:48):**  this soil in their minds.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:49):**  Yeah, yeah, please.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:50):**  Yeah, I could tell you better.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:53):**  So let's dig deeper in the soil.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:56):**  Let's do it.  
**[0:30:57-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:57):**  Let's do it.  
**[0:30:58-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:58):**  Love this.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:30:59):**  So, yeah, the way I think about soil is that it's basically, it's a living organism.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:31:05):**  It's a living web.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:31:07):**  And so in one handful of healthy soil, there are more microbes than there are humans on  
**[0:31:13-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:31:13):**  the planet.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:31:14):**  So it really is a heck of a lot of life going on in there.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:31:19):**  And yeah, so you can imagine there's all these different microbes, bacteria, fungi, and they're  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:31:25):**  all in communication.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:31:27):**  And so what happens with a plant is that the plant is photosynthesizing and it's making  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:31:34):**  sugars.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:31:35):**  And plants put about, or it's been shown that they can put about 30 to 40% of their sugars  
**[0:31:41-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:31:41):**  down into their roots.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:31:43):**  And it's really at the root that you can imagine the root is like the conversation or communication.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:31:52):**  It's like the communication, I don't know, film basically.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:31:57):**  And that is, so it's that point that the plant will put out, or it has a little bit of sugar,  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:32:03):**  and it'll put out a little message and say, I need a bit of phosphate.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:32:10):**  This really reminds me of Brett, just want to go off on a tangent just quickly.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:32:14):**  It really reminds me of Brett breast milk, because I read something, someone posted something,  
**[0:32:19-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:32:19):**  a friend of mine posted something about, we're going to be creating lab breast milk, laboratory  
**[0:32:31-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:32:31):**  breast milk.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:32:32):**  And I read one of the comments, this woman, she was spot on.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:32:34):**  She just said, the difference is that the baby, the communication is between the baby  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:32:42):**  and the mother as to what is needed in the milk.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:32:46):**  And the baby receives exactly what it needs through the milk at that moment in time.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:32:52):**  And this is that same, it's exactly the same conversation that the plant is having that  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:32:56):**  communication to the soil through the sugar you're saying, to then say, this is what I  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:01):**  need for growth.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:02):**  Yeah, yeah, I think it puts out little like, is other messages essentially, at that point,  
**[0:33:09-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:09):**  and sugar is kind of the reward for the bacteria and fungi that bring the what it needs to  
**[0:33:16-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:16):**  it.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:17):**  That is just mind blowing.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:19):**  Honestly, I could stop you there.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:22):**  It's just like I'm done with that.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:24):**  Oh, wow.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:25):**  And it's amazing.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:27):**  And so that little communication framework that's going on below the earth, like it that  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:33):**  is what allows plants to thrive.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:37):**  And so when you start messing about with that, that's when you can get in trouble essentially.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:41):**  And actually, like the fungi, I mean, their network is so extensive, it extends for miles  
**[0:33:48-0:33:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:48):**  around.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:49):**  So one plant could be connected to another plant that's like over a mile away by the  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:53):**  fungal network.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:55):**  So I call it the internet of fungi, essentially.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:33:57):**  You just imagine the internet that we as we understand it, that is happening below ground  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:34:02):**  in fungal, through fungal hyphae and connections.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:34:06):**  And so that's transporting like water, but with a far diverse and totally population.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:34:12):**  Yeah, yeah, it's mental.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:34:15):**  It's yeah, so exciting.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:34:17):**  Way beyond what we could imagine in numbers.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:34:20):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:34:21):**  And so I think, you know, once you start to understand that kind of communication framework,  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:34:26):**  and you start to see soil as essentially a mass of communications and a way to bring  
**[0:34:32-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:34:32):**  a plant whatever it needs, then like soil becomes essentially the most important thing  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:34:40):**  on a farm because that is the communication framework.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:34:45):**  That is where nourishment comes from.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:34:49):**  And yeah, so yeah, that's why I'm obsessed with soil health, basically.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:34:54):**  And not only that, like what, you know, nature isn't too, it like always has multiple advantages.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:01):**  So soil is actually like when it's formed biologically, and when all these microbes  
**[0:35:06-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:06):**  are doing all the work, they build soil structure that allows for oxygen to get through anywhere  
**[0:35:15-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:15):**  in the soil.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:16):**  And it also allows for water to be stored, huge amounts of water can be stored in a healthy  
**[0:35:21-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:21):**  soil.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:23):**  So like, for example, a lot of the flooding in the UK, you know, more and more papers  
**[0:35:27-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:27):**  are showing that it's attributed to a reduction in soil health and a reduced capacity for  
**[0:35:33-0:35:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:33):**  the soil to hold water.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:34):**  So it's the degradation, it's impacted.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:37):**  Totally.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:39):**  Yeah, yeah.

**[0:35:47-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:47):**  In the same way, I think, you know, people talk about the soil biome.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:51):**  It's almost identical in that, you know, we've really learned so much more about the microbiome  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:35:56):**  in our guts, and just how complex that is, and how many different things that affects  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:36:02):**  that we just had no idea, essentially.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:36:04):**  Well, yeah, because we're, yeah, you know, that report on the guy, I think he lives with  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:36:09):**  the Hadza, doesn't he, he goes to stay with the Hadza, and he starts reading his microbiome,  
**[0:36:13-0:36:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:36:13):**  and he gets his microbiome up to the level of the tribe in a window of time.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:36:20):**  And that's everything from the soil, everything in their environment has fed that microbiome.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:36:24):**  It's not like it's taking probiotics, it's just being in the environment and eating what  
**[0:36:29-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:36:29):**  they're eating.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:36:31):**  But we always put the conversation around, well, you've got to eat more fiber, we eat  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:36:35):**  more greens, and you eat more of this, and then that feeds the microbiome.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:36:39):**  Well, actually, no, because if you're feeding on greens, the fiber, but really it's the  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:36:45):**  plant matter that's fed on the real diverse soil that's going to get you to a state where  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:36:50):**  you can fully rewild the gut.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:36:52):**  Agreed.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:36:53):**  Because it's rewilding the land, rewilding the plant, rewilding the gut, rewilding the  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:36:57):**  humans, kind of that whole, again, it's a whole system, isn't it?  
**[0:37:02-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:37:02):**  Totally, yeah.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:37:03):**  And it's roots is this, right?  
**[0:37:05-0:37:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:37:05):**  It's huge, Abi, isn't it?  
**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:37:09):**  Yes.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:37:10):**  It is.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:37:11):**  And I think in the same way that there are principles of, or you think about how to rewild  
**[0:37:19-0:37:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:37:19):**  yourself, farmers are thinking about how to, I mean, it's called regenerative, but what  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:37:25):**  are the practices they can do that build this on their farms?  
**[0:37:29-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:37:29):**  You know, they're introducing animals, they're making sure the soil is always covered.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:37:38):**  You want to make sure there's always a living root in your soil.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:37:43):**  And diversity is key, you know, in this messaging system, if all of the plants are putting out  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:37:48):**  the message for exactly the same nutrient at exactly the same time, then you're going  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:37:53):**  to get this monoculture of bacteria below ground as well.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:37:58):**  And that, as we've seen so many times, you know, that doesn't bode well.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:38:03):**  It's not going to work if you're asking for the same, you know, every single plant in  
**[0:38:09-0:38:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:38:09):**  the field is asking for exactly the same thing at exactly the same time.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:38:12):**  Okay, so Abi, I'm a farmer, right?  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:38:14):**  So I'm a farmer and I've been monocropping.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:38:19):**  What's the process for me?  
**[0:38:21-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:38:21):**  What does it entail?  
**[0:38:23-0:38:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:38:23):**  I want to get back to, I regenerate the soil, I want to become, I want to rewild the land.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:38:28):**  What's the, what's, what's, is there a step here?  
**[0:38:34-0:38:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:38:34):**  What's the first step for the farmer?  
**[0:38:35-0:38:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:38:35):**  What do they need to consider?  
**[0:38:37-0:38:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:38:37):**  Well, I mean, I know it's massive, it's probably a three hour question that one.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:38:44):**  Totally, there's different types of farms and all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:38:46):**  But I think, I do think that the first thing to do is actually maybe to just go and take  
**[0:38:52-0:38:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:38:52):**  a look at your soils.  
**[0:38:53-0:39:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:38:53):**  So to dig some holes and using that understanding of how the soil works to go and look for evidence  
**[0:39:01-0:39:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:39:01):**  of how alive your soil is.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:39:03):**  And actually on our website, we have a totally free protocol, set of protocols of different  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:39:08):**  ways that you can look and learn to see how alive your soil is.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:39:13):**  So they, yeah, I think that's a starting place.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:39:16):**  The other thing is, it's also about kind of a mindset shift, essentially.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:39:26):**  So it's starting to, I think, you know, the best thing farmers can do is they go and they  
**[0:39:33-0:39:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:39:33):**  engage with different regenerative farming groups around the UK and, you know, going  
**[0:39:39-0:39:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:39:39):**  and like there's a farmer called Fred Price in Somerset, and he's transitioned his farm  
**[0:39:43-0:39:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:39:43):**  over the last eight years.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:39:45):**  Okay.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:39:46):**  And actually, the first thing he did, he was like a conventional arable farmer, so growing  
**[0:39:51-0:39:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:39:51):**  all grains using inputs and he was achieving really high yields.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:39:58):**  But his farm financially was looking atrocious.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:40:02):**  So he started to reduce nitrogen inputs, essentially.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:40:08):**  And that was really the start of his journey, was starting to reduce the chemical inputs  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:40:13):**  that he was using.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:40:14):**  And then the soil automatically started to improve.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:40:18):**  And then he started putting in what they call cover crops, which is essentially like a biodiverse  
**[0:40:25-0:40:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:40:25):**  mix of different crops that he was putting in between his wheat, for example.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:40:32):**  And so that was allowing the soil to recover a little bit.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:40:36):**  Yeah, so and it took eight years.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:40:39):**  He also, as part of that, introduced pigs onto the farm.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:40:42):**  He's, you know, one of the best pig farmers I've ever seen.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:40:48):**  All of the pigs live outside all of the time, and they graze on pasture, and they're moved  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:40:53):**  regularly and they live in the woodlands in the winter.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:40:57):**  And it's an amazing system.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:41:01):**  And yeah, and his pork is, it's just like nothing else you've ever tasted.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:41:07):**  You know you're eating nourishment.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:41:09):**  And again, it's understanding that it's a whole system, it is a system.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:41:16):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:41:18):**  Yeah, I mean, he wasn't that interested in farming animals, but he knew that he couldn't  
**[0:41:24-0:41:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:41:24):**  shift his system to being regenerative if he didn't have those animals, the pigs in  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:41:33):**  there eating some of the cover crops.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:41:37):**  So you know when the fields weren't being used for wheat production, for example, he  
**[0:41:43-0:41:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:41:43):**  needed to have a way of being able to, you know, essentially make money from the other  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:41:50):**  fields whilst also building up the nutrient level in that soil so that he could then grow  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:41:56):**  wheat crop again further down the line, if that makes sense.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:02):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:05):**  It's, yeah, it's an unfolding journey.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:10):**  And people talk about it as the regenerative journey.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:12):**  Yeah, you can understand that.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:15):**  I mean, what about the, what about, what about, say this, what's his name again?  
**[0:42:21-0:42:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:21):**  Sorry, Price?  
**[0:42:22-0:42:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:22):**  Fred Price at Gough

**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:25):**  So does Fred Price, I mean, does he mention about his own, I mean, emotional health and  
**[0:42:29-0:42:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:29):**  well being within it?  
**[0:42:30-0:42:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:30):**  Because you know, the bigger picture again is, you know, it's always about the good  
**[0:42:35-0:42:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:35):**  for the human good for the environment, as far as I'm concerned.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:38):**  And so are the farmers coming forward and saying, with that regenerative process, they're  
**[0:42:43-0:42:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:43):**  making more of a connection to the earth?  
**[0:42:46-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:46):**  Is their emotional well being improving through this process?  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:49):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:52):**  And I think that that's one thing that surprises them all the most.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:42:56):**  Great, great to do that.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:43:00):**  Yeah, so another farmer who also has transitioned recently, like Fred and the other farmer were  
**[0:43:10-0:43:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:43:10):**  in conversation.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:43:12):**  And they both said that suddenly, they're able to feel joy in their farming experience.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:43:20):**  And on a day to day basis, they actually are able to sometimes like, for example, take  
**[0:43:25-0:43:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:43:25):**  a holiday and they don't, you know, they're able to feel good about what they're doing.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:43:32):**  And I think, well, I think there's, I think actually, Gabe Brown, who's kind of like,  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:43:38):**  one of the, you know, he was sort of the figurehead or is sort of the figurehead of the regenerative  
**[0:43:43-0:43:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:43:43):**  farming movement in the United States.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:43:46):**  And he wrote a book called Dirt to Soil, which does really talk about the regenerative transition  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:43:52):**  for farmers.  
**[0:43:54-0:44:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:43:54):**  And he's, the way he describes it is that he wakes up every morning now.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:44:00):**  And he used to, sorry, he used to wake up every morning and think about what am I going  
**[0:44:03-0:44:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:44:03):**  to kill today?  
**[0:44:06-0:44:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:44:06):**  Now he wakes up every morning and thinks, what can I help flourish today?  
**[0:44:12-0:44:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:44:12):**  And I think, you know, just imagine waking up every morning and thinking, what are you  
**[0:44:15-0:44:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:44:15):**  going to kill today?  
**[0:44:16-0:44:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:44:16):**  Like, that's not a very positive mindset.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:44:23):**  So yeah, multiple farmers have told me, it's completely shifted their mental health.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:44:31):**  And I think that, you know, there are incredibly high suicide rates in the farming community.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:44:39):**  And I do think that that's one thing I always try and emphasize to people who aren't in  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:44:43):**  the farming community is that this really isn't about making farmers wrong for what  
**[0:44:48-0:44:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:44:48):**  they're doing.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:44:49):**  Like, I think it's very much a systemic societal issue, as opposed to individual farmers making  
**[0:44:56-0:44:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:44:56):**  bad decisions.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:44:59):**  You know, farmers are just, they're being, they're businesses, so they're just following  
**[0:45:04-0:45:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:45:04):**  where the market is taking them.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:45:07):**  And they're just doing their best.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:45:10):**  And sometimes that ends up in kind of a system that they don't even like, but that's the  
**[0:45:17-0:45:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:45:17):**  business they're in, and there's not much that they can do about it.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:45:19):**  And they're maintaining debts and all this kind of stuff.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:45:22):**  So yeah, it's on all of us in a way.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:45:25):**  Well, it's pretty fair to say that it's the, in order for farmers to fully implement it,  
**[0:45:33-0:45:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:45:33):**  I guess the regenerative processes and practices.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:45:36):**  Well, they need the consumers support, right?  
**[0:45:40-0:45:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:45:40):**  That's one level, isn't it?  
**[0:45:42-0:45:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:45:42):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:45:43):**  But also, then we got to look at fair trade, right?  
**[0:45:45-0:45:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:45:45):**  And everything else that comes through that process.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:45:47):**  So that's the support of the consumer, but then outside that government level, really.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:45:54):**  I mean, that's where it's at.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:45:56):**  I mean, a lot of these farmers, we're looking at, I mean, it's inherited generation to generation  
**[0:46:00-0:46:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:00):**  to generation, isn't it?  
**[0:46:02-0:46:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:02):**  A lot of them, yeah.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:04):**  You know?  
**[0:46:05-0:46:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:05):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:06):**  And so the fears and everything else that comes with that can be inherited.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:10):**  So if your fear is the finances and the yields and everything else in that language, it's  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:15):**  almost like learning how to deconstruct that.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:20):**  Exactly.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:22):**  And I think, you know, for a lot of farmers, you're carrying a lot of debt as well.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:28):**  And I do think that's a real trap because farm machines are like 100,000, you know,  
**[0:46:35-0:46:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:35):**  can be 100,000 pounds.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:36):**  And then you're paying off those debts over many, many years.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:40):**  So if you've bought a machine that works for a chemical system, to just, you know, how  
**[0:46:46-0:46:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:46):**  are you going to keep servicing those debts and you've still got that machine and you're  
**[0:46:52-0:46:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:52):**  going to shift to this new system?  
**[0:46:53-0:46:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:53):**  Like, it doesn't just make sense immediately.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:46:57):**  So there are a lot of barriers to change in farming.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:47:01):**  And you know, we need to acknowledge those.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:47:05):**  For us, you know, eaters, it's kind of easy to just walk into the supermarket and say,  
**[0:47:10-0:47:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:47:10):**  oh, do I want organic or not?  
**[0:47:13-0:47:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:47:13):**  You know, it's such a simple decision.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:47:16):**  It's really not that simple for farmers.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:47:19):**  And yeah, that's something that I learned like kind of the hard way coming into the  
**[0:47:24-0:47:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:47:24):**  farming system, sort of naively and thinking like, well, why isn't everyone organic?  
**[0:47:31-0:47:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:47:31):**  And then it's slowly dawning on me as I visited more farms, and I just realized what a huge  
**[0:47:37-0:47:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:47:37):**  struggle it is to achieve that in the current market climate and with the current policies  
**[0:47:44-0:47:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:47:44):**  in place.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:47:45):**  And just, it's just not easy, basically.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:47:49):**  So yeah, we really can't, I would never blame or judge a farmer for how they farm basically.  
**[0:47:56-0:47:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:47:56):**  And I think that's quite important.  
**[0:47:57-0:47:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:47:57):**  Because it's a journey, isn't it?  
**[0:47:59-0:48:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:47:59):**  And even if, you know, perhaps farmer of 50 years of age, maybe, you know, he might not  
**[0:48:06-0:48:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:06):**  get it in this lifetime, but the next generation that inherit might do.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:09):**  Yeah, totally.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:10):**  It's a journey, isn't it?  
**[0:48:12-0:48:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:12):**  Gotta have compassion for that, really.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:15):**  I mean, because we all go through it.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:16):**  It's like if you buy anything, I could be a sustainable brand.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:19):**  I'm designing something at the moment, we're just having a conversation about transparency  
**[0:48:24-0:48:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:24):**  and sustainable materials, you know, going all the way through the conversation.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:29):**  And then you realize that it's such an expensive process, and that has to reflect in the price

**[0:48:39-0:48:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:39):**  So if you, what's the biggest complaint around organic food and produce?  
**[0:48:43-0:48:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:43):**  Oh, it's more expensive.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:45):**  It's this, it's this, but we have to support it.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:49):**  That's the thing.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:50):**  Without that support, what does the farmer do, you know?  
**[0:48:54-0:48:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:54):**  Totally.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:55):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:48:56):**  And I think, yeah, the cost of food is a massive conversation.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:49:00):**  And where I've kind of got to on it is that, to me, it's really awful.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:49:09):**  And it's not okay that we think people who have less money deserve food that has lower  
**[0:49:17-0:49:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:49:17):**  nutritional value.

**[0:49:25-0:49:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:49:25):**  really awful.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:49:26):**  That's been normalized.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:49:27):**  Yeah, it's been normalized to think that it's okay, we can fob off people who don't have  
**[0:49:32-0:49:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:49:32):**  enough money with just like, basically nutritionist food.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:49:36):**  That's fine.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:49:37):**  We'll just give them calories, and they'll carry on.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:49:41):**  And I think that we need to question that.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:49:44):**  That's not okay.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:49:45):**  Like, well, it's not okay from start to finish, is it?  
**[0:49:49-0:49:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:49:49):**  Because it compromises the human at the end, you know, compromises the soil because we're  
**[0:49:54-0:49:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:49:54):**  producing it again in compromised soil, because it's perceived as so cheap to do that, to  
**[0:49:59-0:50:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:49:59):**  offer that process.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:50:00):**  And then crippling the farmer and his finances in between.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:50:04):**  It's crazy.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:50:05):**  Totally.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:50:06):**  Yeah, it's just, it really doesn't work in so many ways.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:50:12):**  So I think we really need to start thinking about, you know, accessibility to food, as  
**[0:50:19-0:50:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:50:19):**  opposed to cheap food.

**[0:50:28-0:50:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:50:28):**  high, you know, nutritious food is accessible to all is really important.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:50:34):**  And it's just that's a slightly different conversation, essentially.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:50:37):**  I think, again, in the cereal series, we kind of went into that because that was one of  
**[0:50:42-0:50:46](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:50:42):**  the things that actually inspired us to make it, was when we learned that flour today,  
**[0:50:46-0:50:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:50:46):**  you know, like normal plain flour, has, like officially got almost zero nutritional value  
**[0:50:54-0:50:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:50:54):**  to it.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:50:56):**  And so much so that the government requires that you add nutrients to that flour before  
**[0:51:00-0:51:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:00):**  you sell it.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:01):**  What are we doing?  
**[0:51:03-0:51:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:03):**  I don't know.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:04):**  Why?  
**[0:51:05-0:51:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:05):**  Yeah, fortifying flour, like that is the norm.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:06):**  We add nutrients back in, and then sell it, and that's required by law.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:11):**  So somehow we got from a food substance that we then took, made sure it had zero nutritional  
**[0:51:18-0:51:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:18):**  value, and then we put some stuff back in and sold that to people.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:22):**  I just think that is mental.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:24):**  How did that happen?  
**[0:51:28-0:51:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:28):**  It's just this huge level of disconnection, isn't it?  
**[0:51:31-0:51:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:31):**  Yeah, it really is.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:34):**  It's total disconnection from any kind of ecosystem.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:37):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:38):**  It's very, it's alarming, isn't it?  
**[0:51:42-0:51:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:42):**  You know, we experienced it, you've been around it, but I guess, you know, I'm out in nature,  
**[0:51:49-0:51:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:49):**  I'm in the, on the heath, let's just call it the heath, and the heath near us.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:54):**  And you have this like 20 minutes out there, and the recommend, you know, recommended 20  
**[0:51:58-0:52:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:51:58):**  minutes or lower heart rate, blood pressure, cortisol, just that alone, just 20 minutes  
**[0:52:04-0:52:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:52:04):**  in that environment.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:52:06):**  And that helps reconnect to self, doesn't it?  
**[0:52:10-0:52:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:52:10):**  Do you think there's like a connection between our farming practices and disconnection to  
**[0:52:19-0:52:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:52:19):**  the land and ourselves?  
**[0:52:21-0:52:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:52:21):**  Like the disconnection to self.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:52:24):**  So not just, do you think we should be, more people should be involved with farming, in  
**[0:52:29-0:52:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:52:29):**  other words?  
**[0:52:30-0:52:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:52:30):**  Do you think that Mr Riddle here can, should be invited into the farm to see the practices,  
**[0:52:39-0:52:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:52:39):**  to make more of a connection to it, more of a connection to the earth, the food supply?  
**[0:52:43-0:52:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:52:43):**  Do you get where I'm going there?  
**[0:52:47-0:52:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:52:47):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:52:48):**  Does that make sense?  
**[0:52:49-0:52:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:52:49):**  Got it.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:52:50):**  I think, interestingly, particularly thinking about the social justice and racial justice  
**[0:52:57-0:53:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:52:57):**  movement, there's a lady called Leah Penniman.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:53:01):**  She wrote a book called Farming While Black.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:53:03):**  And one of the things that she says that, and I've heard this again and again, particularly  
**[0:53:10-0:53:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:53:10):**  from black people, is that like starting to farm and garden themselves brought this whole  
**[0:53:19-0:53:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:53:19):**  new sense of self that they just had never experienced in their lives, basically.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:53:26):**  It's like, it gives you a confidence that isn't accessible elsewhere.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:53:33):**  It is like, and so it's not just black people I've heard that from.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:53:38):**  Of course, I've also heard, you know, there's many other people, but I just thought that  
**[0:53:42-0:53:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:53:42):**  was really interesting because of course, you know, the racial experience is even more  
**[0:53:47-0:53:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:53:47):**  disconnecting.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:53:49):**  And so it was interesting, you know, valuable to hear how much that impacted their lives  
**[0:53:55-0:53:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:53:55):**  and their sense of self.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:53:57):**  And so I do think that, yes, Mr. Riddle, going to a farm, I think it's not just about seeing  
**[0:54:04-0:54:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:54:04):**  it, but it's actually about doing it.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:54:07):**  Being part of the process.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:54:09):**  Being, yeah.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:54:10):**  Being, but I think, I really think you can gain that just from your garden.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:54:14):**  If you're able to grow things yourself, I think that you can engage with this whole  
**[0:54:20-0:54:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:54:20):**  soil process, like just in a garden or even, it's harder to do in a pot of soil because  
**[0:54:26-0:54:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:54:26):**  obviously you're disconnected from the fungal network when you're in a pot.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:54:33):**  But if you are able to access land that has soil in it, then you can quite quickly connect  
**[0:54:41-0:54:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:54:41):**  with this whole life underground and you can start to work with it and sort of do a dance,  
**[0:54:47-0:54:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:54:47):**  a gardening dance, and play with biodiversity and growing different vegetables amongst flowers

**[0:56:19-0:56:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:56:19):**  And I had people just standing in a circle and we'd breathe together.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:56:24):**  And then it turned into like working head to head.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:56:27):**  And then they were just kind of, you know, I had the wrestling in the end around in the  
**[0:56:31-0:56:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:56:31):**  mud.

**[0:56:34-0:56:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:56:34):**  But it was almost like you had to give them the permission to do it to begin with.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:56:40):**  But the moment they'd entered it, the moment they were in the mud, and they surrendered  
**[0:56:45-0:56:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:56:45):**  to that point where, right, I'm in now, I'm all in.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:56:50):**  It was no longer just about, you know, it was a bit of mud on my trackie.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:56:52):**  They were just caked in it.

**[0:56:56-0:56:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:56:56):**  It just went to a muddy mass.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:56:58):**  But just the joy, just the level of joy, like the happiness that came through it.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:57:04):**  And just the barely laughter, everything that comes through that process, you suddenly see,  
**[0:57:08-0:57:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:57:08):**  wow, that's is it just comes through that reconnection.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:57:12):**  I want to, yeah, I guess it'd be interesting to see the studies around farming, wouldn't

**[0:57:18-0:57:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:57:18):**  Whether, you know, statistically, whether as regenerative practices are coming in, how  
**[0:57:23-0:57:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:57:23):**  that health and well being of the farming community improves.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:57:28):**  And then what that means that goes into the figure.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:57:30):**  I honestly believe that, you know, it's like when I'm, if you have a forage door, you understand  
**[0:57:35-0:57:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:57:35):**  digestion, it's like, right, you make a connection to the food.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:57:39):**  And then it already is stimulating the digestive system.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:57:43):**  You know, and then that whole system then is supported by just you feeling and sensing  
**[0:57:48-0:57:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:57:48):**  and smelling all the senses coming alive.  
**[0:57:52-0:57:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:57:52):**  We listened to, there's a farming community called Casita Verde, which is in Ibiza.  
**[0:57:58-0:57:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:57:58):**  We were living there.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:57:59):**  And there's, I think they're permaculture now.  
**[0:58:02-0:58:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:58:02):**  And their conversation, I'm sure was around even the farming, like urinating on the land  
**[0:58:08-0:58:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:58:08):**  and all of that going into the soil that their DNA is actually in the soil.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:58:14):**  Everything is in there in that process.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:58:16):**  Wow.

**[0:58:30-0:58:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:58:30):**  D. Mama D. She's an amazing, amazing woman.

**[0:58:42-0:58:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:58:42):**  And she did this experience.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:58:45):**  It was on a farm near Glastonbury, actually.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:58:49):**  And she gave us each like a role in the woodland community.  
**[0:58:54-0:58:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:58:54):**  So I was lichen.  
**[0:58:56-0:59:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:58:56):**  And she took us into this little forest and we each had to like take on the role of the  
**[0:59:01-0:59:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:59:01):**  whatever we'd been given.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:59:03):**  So I was lichen.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:59:04):**  So I spent a lot of time at the bottom of a tree, just sitting there being in the forest.  
**[0:59:10-0:59:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:59:10):**  And then the story, she kind of was telling us the story of the woodland.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:59:14):**  And then there was basically an apocalyptic event and we all died.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:59:19):**  And we lived through that death and we were kind of reborn as soil.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:59:26):**  And it was in that moment that I like really connected to realizing that, you know, ashes  
**[0:59:31-0:59:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:59:31):**  to ashes, dust to dust, like, we come from the soil, and we will return to the soil.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:59:40):**  And that I felt a huge like, sense of relief in that.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:59:45):**  And a sort of beauty in the idea that my body would decompose and become soil.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:59:51):**  Like, sort of romantic, isn't it?

**[0:59:58-1:00:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=0:59:58):**  have any beliefs around afterlife or anything like that.

**[1:00:07-1:00:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:00:07):**  I don't know.

**[1:00:54-1:01:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:00:54):**  And I always discuss like the sensory input, because we're the sensorial beings, right?  
**[1:01:01-1:01:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:01:01):**  So as butt naked as you can possibly be to the elements means that your senses are constantly  
**[1:01:06-1:01:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:01:06):**  alive.

**[1:01:16-1:01:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:01:16):**  But then if we go, if we're talking about going deeper than that, really going into  
**[1:01:20-1:01:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:01:20):**  it, then we're looking at not just the microbiome contact with the skin, we're looking at a  
**[1:01:27-1:01:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:01:27):**  network that is very powerful.

**[1:01:33-1:01:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:01:33):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:01:34):**  Within the soil within that network.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:01:36):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:37-1:01:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:01:37):**  And I think that is the realization of regenerative farming, in a sense that's hitting the nail  
**[1:01:43-1:01:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:01:43):**  on the head is that for the last 60 to 80 years, maybe longer, you know, we've thought  
**[1:01:49-1:01:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:01:49):**  that we were the consciousness in farming.  
**[1:01:52-1:01:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:01:52):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:53-1:01:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:01:53):**  And that we were the decision makers and that we were going to control everything.  
**[1:01:57-1:01:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:01:57):**  Aye, aye, aye.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:01:59):**  Ego, ego, ego.

**[1:02:09-1:02:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:02:09):**  and the whole ecosystem.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:02:12):**  And we're just a mere kind of, you know, part of that.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:02:17):**  So we're part of that kind of ongoing ecosystem interaction and where can we place ourselves  
**[1:02:24-1:02:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:02:24):**  and how can we help with it and guide it in a direction maybe that we want it to go in,  
**[1:02:30-1:02:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:02:30):**  but keep the humility and recognizing that the consciousness lays everywhere else as  
**[1:02:35-1:02:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:02:35):**  well, essentially.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:02:36):**  Yeah.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:02:37):**  I always, I have this, I wrote about it saying that consciousness is like one of the most  
**[1:02:44-1:02:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:02:44):**  patient, yet resilient, most patient, relentless, there we go, teachers, teachers, you know,  
**[1:02:59-1:03:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:02:59):**  wise teachers that, you know, we keep going at something, keep going and there'll be subtle,  
**[1:03:04-1:03:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:03:04):**  subtle messages, no, no, no, nearly there, nearly there, nearly there.  
**[1:03:08-1:03:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:03:08):**  You know, and then we have to go through this whole, sometimes terrible process to get to  
**[1:03:13-1:03:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:03:13):**  something but we finally get there.  
**[1:03:16-1:03:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:03:16):**  Yeah.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:03:17):**  This is one of those conversations where it feels like that.  
**[1:03:20-1:03:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:03:20):**  And it's on the path of rewilding, isn't it?  
**[1:03:22-1:03:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:03:22):**  Because if you think about the, it's a bit of a contradiction, isn't it?  
**[1:03:25-1:03:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:03:25):**  Because if you think about we went from wild and then farming was kind of the closing,  
**[1:03:29-1:03:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:03:29):**  that going into agriculture kind of meant that we were no longer a wild being.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:03:35):**  So do you view like that regenerative process as on the path to rewilding or is...  
**[1:03:42-1:03:43](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:03:42):**  Yeah.  
**[1:03:43-1:03:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:03:43):**  Trying to get the farm or in something that is more of a wild state, which as you say  
**[1:03:48-1:03:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:03:48):**  would then be like the consciousness where it takes more care of itself and less human  
**[1:03:55-1:03:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:03:55):**  intervention.  
**[1:03:56-1:03:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:03:56):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[1:03:58-1:04:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:03:58):**  And I think, yeah, it's about less human intervention.  
**[1:04:01-1:04:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:01):**  It's not about no human intervention because I do think that, you know...  
**[1:04:05-1:04:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:05):**  There's a custodian level to it and there is in the rainforest, isn't there?  
**[1:04:09-1:04:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:09):**  Like the tribes are responsible for the rainforest.  
**[1:04:12-1:04:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:12):**  Well, and not just that, like part of rewilding yourself is recognizing that you are part  
**[1:04:16-1:04:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:16):**  of the wild, right?  
**[1:04:17-1:04:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:17):**  Yeah, you are nature.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:19):**  You are it.  
**[1:04:20-1:04:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:20):**  So this isn't about taking humans out of the picture because we are the destroyers and  
**[1:04:27-1:04:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:27):**  the destructive force inherently.  
**[1:04:29-1:04:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:29):**  We are part of the ecosystem.  
**[1:04:31-1:04:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:31):**  We're part of the wild.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:33):**  And this is about, okay, let's get back to a system where the humans are more in balance  
**[1:04:41-1:04:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:41):**  with everything else that's part of the wild rather than this kind of dictator ego that's  
**[1:04:48-1:04:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:48):**  just trying to control everything for only our own needs, which is essentially an extractive  
**[1:04:54-1:04:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:54):**  system.  
**[1:04:55-1:04:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:55):**  Yeah, so it's that harmonious interdependence.  
**[1:04:57-1:04:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:57):**  Exactly.  
**[1:04:58-1:04:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:58):**  Reestablishing that.  
**[1:04:59-1:05:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:04:59):**  Exactly.  
**[1:05:00-1:05:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:05:00):**  That we have a significant role within it, but we're not separate of it.  
**[1:05:06-1:05:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:05:06):**  Yeah.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:05:07):**  Exactly.  
**[1:05:08-1:05:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:05:08):**  Yeah, it's part of us.  
**[1:05:09-1:05:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:05:09):**  I think just to be clear, like there is a rewilding movement in the farming sector.  
**[1:05:15-1:05:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:05:15):**  I don't know how much you've seen that, but you know, it's quite controversial in some  
**[1:05:22-1:05:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:05:22):**  ways because some proponents of rewilding do consider it more about that the humans  
**[1:05:29-1:05:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:05:29):**  are the destroyers and that we should just completely remove ourselves from those landscapes.  
**[1:05:36-1:05:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:05:36):**  And I think what concerns me a little bit about that is that the idea then is that you  
**[1:05:42-1:05:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:05:42):**  would produce food in very kind of intensive areas of land using the old or this chemical  
**[1:05:53-1:05:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:05:53):**  paradigm essentially.  
**[1:05:54-1:05:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:05:54):**  Leading to more destruction and degradation.  
**[1:05:59-1:06:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:05:59):**  Exactly.  
**[1:06:00-1:06:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:06:00):**  And ignoring all the natural systems.  
**[1:06:03-1:06:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:06:03):**  And then leading to further human suffering, which then disconnects us from being well  
**[1:06:10-1:06:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:06:10):**  being.

**[1:06:13-1:06:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:06:13):**  And like, you know, how are you going to have any nutritional quality in that food in the  
**[1:06:15-1:06:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:06:15):**  long term?  
**[1:06:17-1:06:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:06:17):**  And it just, it doesn't make any sense to me.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:06:20):**  And you know, some of what, for example, George Monbiot says, you know, he had that program  
**[1:06:26-1:06:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:06:26):**  recently where he was advocating for food grown in the lab.  
**[1:06:29-1:06:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:06:29):**  Yeah, the forestry ground food.  
**[1:06:31-1:06:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:06:31):**  Yeah.  
**[1:06:32-1:06:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:06:32):**  And I just, I it's from like, if we think of the soil and the complexity of it and the  
**[1:06:40-1:06:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:06:40):**  microbiome and the complexity of it, it just doesn't make sense to me that we should try  
**[1:06:47-1:06:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:06:47):**  and feed ourselves from a lab.  
**[1:06:49-1:06:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:06:49):**  Because I can almost guarantee we have missed a key point there.  
**[1:06:54-1:07:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:06:54):**  When it's almost like those, you know, when you see the text afterwards, it always reads,

**[1:07:10-1:07:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:10):**  breast milk, because I know for some mothers that we go, oh, brilliant means I don't have  
**[1:07:13-1:07:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:13):**  to give my child formula.  
**[1:07:14-1:07:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:14):**  But again, we're losing sight of, and in some cases, that has to be the case.  
**[1:07:19-1:07:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:19):**  I get that.  
**[1:07:20-1:07:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:20):**  But of course, we're losing sight of all this.  
**[1:07:23-1:07:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:23):**  There's more to that.  
**[1:07:24-1:07:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:24):**  There's the microbiome that's being fed through the breast milk.  
**[1:07:27-1:07:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:27):**  There's only the specific properties in breast milk that only feed the bifido bacterium of  
**[1:07:33-1:07:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:33):**  the baby's gut.  
**[1:07:34-1:07:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:34):**  It doesn't have any other need for the baby.  
**[1:07:38-1:07:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:38):**  Doesn't fit any other need other than the microbiome.  
**[1:07:40-1:07:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:40):**  And then we're talking about the fungal network, what that has for our system, not just on  
**[1:07:45-1:07:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:45):**  a microbiome level, but I guess it's feeding multiple systems.  
**[1:07:49-1:07:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:49):**  And then what that's gaining from the food.  
**[1:07:51-1:07:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:51):**  Again, yeah, again, what could possibly go wrong?  
**[1:07:53-1:07:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:53):**  Yeah, totally.  
**[1:07:58-1:08:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:07:58):**  I mean, I was a bit flabbergasted by him.  
**[1:08:00-1:08:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:08:00):**  I couldn't understand why he's suddenly taken that stance.  
**[1:08:04-1:08:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:08:04):**  I haven't got there yet.  
**[1:08:05-1:08:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:08:05):**  I don't really understand that enough, really.  
**[1:08:08-1:08:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:08:08):**  I think he's just trying to take an extreme stance in some ways.  
**[1:08:13-1:08:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:08:13):**  But I think the problem is that many of his ideas are brilliant.  
**[1:08:20-1:08:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:08:20):**  Yes, we should absolutely be bringing more wildness to farms.  
**[1:08:26-1:08:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:08:26):**  And I think most farmers agree with that.  
**[1:08:30-1:08:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:08:30):**  But what he's advocating for is what we call land sparing.  
**[1:08:35-1:08:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:08:35):**  So allowing land to be completely wild and then just our human destruction is created  
**[1:08:44-1:08:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:08:44):**  in isolated spaces.  
**[1:08:45-1:08:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:08:45):**  Whereas what I'm more pro is what they call land sharing.  
**[1:08:50-1:08:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:08:50):**  And land sharing is about how can we bring this wildness to our farming systems and have  
**[1:08:56-1:08:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:08:56):**  humans be part of that, like we just discussed.  
**[1:08:59-1:09:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:08:59):**  And that's really what regenerative agriculture is about.  
**[1:09:02-1:09:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:09:02):**  It's about bringing the diversity, encouraging the insects, working with all the insects  
**[1:09:08-1:09:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:09:08):**  and these different fungal systems to clean water on the farms, to store water on the  
**[1:09:15-1:09:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:09:15):**  farms, to create nutritious food, and also to even sequester carbon is one of the positive  
**[1:09:23-1:09:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:09:23):**  outcomes of taking the more regenerative route in farming.  
**[1:09:27-1:09:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:09:27):**  Yeah, because otherwise, again, it's not ticking the box of diversity.  
**[1:09:34-1:09:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:09:34):**  It's ticking a box of divide, isn't it?  
**[1:09:36-1:09:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:09:36):**  It's like we're trying to separate ourselves even further from nature if we say that, OK,  
**[1:09:44-1:09:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:09:44):**  we don't create one system where we can coexist within it.  
**[1:09:50-1:09:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:09:50):**  It's again that ego again, oh, well, we can do it this way.  
**[1:09:54-1:10:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:09:54):**  We can grow laboratory meat and we can, again, it's kind of stamping our authority over nature  
**[1:10:00-1:10:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:10:00):**  again instead of connecting with the fact that we simply are it, you know?  
**[1:10:06-1:10:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:10:06):**  Completely.  
**[1:10:07-1:10:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:10:07):**  Yeah, I completely agree.  
**[1:10:08-1:10:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:10:08):**  And I think it's also it's sort of weirdly, it's a worship of nature that can lead you  
**[1:10:16-1:10:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:10:16):**  there.  
**[1:10:17-1:10:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:10:17):**  Yeah, because if you see nature as other and the environment as other and you worship it  
**[1:10:25-1:10:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:10:25):**  to the point where you only see human beings as the destructive force on the earth, that's  
**[1:10:32-1:10:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:10:32):**  when you start to think that that's a good idea.  
**[1:10:36-1:10:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:10:36):**  So, yeah, I'm definitely always moving away from that perspective.  
**[1:10:40-1:10:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:10:40):**  Yeah, it involves a lot of inner work again as well, doesn't it?  
**[1:10:45-1:10:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:10:45):**  The inner work comes in, I always say that, you know, working with things like breath  
**[1:10:49-1:10:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:10:49):**  and dismantling or deconstructing old paradigms and language has to come in as well.  
**[1:10:54-1:10:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:10:54):**  I feel we're in the process of reconnecting to being nature.  
**[1:10:58-1:11:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:10:58):**  And on that note, I mean, the inner work is also in working in the soil, right?  
**[1:11:04-1:11:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:11:04):**  Working in getting your hands dirty and getting in the environment.  
**[1:11:08-1:11:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:11:08):**  And that might mean as you're saying simple, it could be simply gardening, it could be  
**[1:11:12-1:11:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:11:12):**  a few pots on your terrace, it could be anything still making that connection.  
**[1:11:16-1:11:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:11:16):**  It's still nice example.  
**[1:11:18-1:11:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:11:18):**  I had the guys at the weekend.  
**[1:11:20-1:11:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:11:20):**  I just said find 10 things in goat nose, it go into the heat, and we defined an area that  
**[1:11:26-1:11:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:11:26):**  really resonant where you feel that you're really drawn to I need to be there.  
**[1:11:30-1:11:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:11:30):**  And I just want you to pause for a moment and then find 10 things that you're drawn  
**[1:11:34-1:11:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:11:34):**  to, I want you to build a little structure, you know.  
**[1:11:39-1:11:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:11:39):**  And then you just sit and then use meditate, breathe, I just did breathwork, I said 40  
**[1:11:42-1:11:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:11:42):**  cycles of breath, that's all you need to do.  
**[1:11:44-1:11:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:11:44):**  And it was just amazing watching the kind of how quickly they down regulated and became  
**[1:11:51-1:11:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:11:51):**  part of that environment.  
**[1:11:52-1:11:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:11:52):**  So enthralled in what they were doing, you know.  
**[1:11:56-1:12:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:11:56):**  So again, that's just taking it back, getting it into the earth and not seeing ourselves  
**[1:12:00-1:12:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:12:00):**  as separate.  
**[1:12:01-1:12:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:12:01):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think there's, I heard about this coach, farmer coach, or he used  
**[1:12:08-1:12:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:12:08):**  to be an agronomist, so advising farmers on what they should be doing on their land.  
**[1:12:15-1:12:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:12:15):**  And then he became a coach.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:12:17):**  He's based in Canada.  
**[1:12:20-1:12:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:12:20):**  And he said that, you know, he really realized that the first thing he needed to do to help  
**[1:12:25-1:12:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:12:25):**  farmers change was actually to just have them meditate for 15 minutes a day.  
**[1:12:30-1:12:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:12:30):**  So meditate in the broadest sense of the word, i.e. stop, look around at all the nature around  
**[1:12:36-1:12:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:12:36):**  them and just breathe.  
**[1:12:38-1:12:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:12:38):**  And just, yeah, just experience it.  
**[1:12:42-1:12:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:12:42):**  Because as with all aspects of modern life, one of the things that happens on the farm  
**[1:12:47-1:12:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:12:47):**  is you get drawn into the hamster wheel of doing.  
**[1:12:52-1:13:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:12:52):**  And you forget to just stop and to take in where you are and to reconnect with who you  
**[1:13:01-1:13:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:13:01):**  are as a human being.  
**[1:13:03-1:13:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:13:03):**  And that is so important for, you know, if you want to have a healthy farm, you need  
**[1:13:08-1:13:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:13:08):**  to build yourself to be a healthy human being as well.  
**[1:13:13-1:13:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:13:13):**  Because we are a human being, Abby, not a human doing.  
**[1:13:16-1:13:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:13:16):**  Exactly.  
**[1:13:17-1:13:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:13:17):**  Okay, so I'm going to wrap things up soon.  
**[1:13:25-1:13:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:13:25):**  What I mean, what other than buying food, of course, to support, what can we as the  
**[1:13:30-1:13:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:13:30):**  individual be doing to support soil regeneration, the movement, let's say?  
**[1:13:34-1:13:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:13:34):**  Well, I was just saying...  
**[1:13:36-1:13:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:13:36):**  To help get behind it, what can we be doing?

**[1:13:42-1:13:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:13:42):**  and you do happen to have garden space, then a good person to look up online is actually  
**[1:13:49-1:13:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:13:49):**  a guy called Charles Dowding.  
**[1:13:52-1:13:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:13:52):**  And he's the proponent of no dig gardening.  
**[1:13:56-1:14:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:13:56):**  And no dig gardening is kind of at the core of building soil health in your garden.  
**[1:14:02-1:14:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:14:02):**  Because as soon as you start to dig, or as soon as you start to turn soil, you break  
**[1:14:06-1:14:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:14:06):**  all the fungal networks and then you'll have real trouble.  
**[1:14:11-1:14:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:14:11):**  So that's like the tilling process.  
**[1:14:13-1:14:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:14:13):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[1:14:15-1:14:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:14:15):**  So yeah, if you watch some of his videos about how to garden effectively for your soil, that  
**[1:14:20-1:14:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:14:20):**  can really help you get started.  
**[1:14:22-1:14:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:14:22):**  In terms of like food and buying, I mean, you know, one way is to start to move away  
**[1:14:31-1:14:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:14:31):**  from supermarkets, essentially.  
**[1:14:34-1:14:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:14:34):**  So you know, maybe you could just choose one type of food that you're buying.  
**[1:14:37-1:14:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:14:37):**  I don't know, maybe most people you work with are already not buying supermarkets.  
**[1:14:41-1:14:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:14:41):**  But for example, meat or pulses, you know, you could start buying all of your pulses  
**[1:14:48-1:14:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:14:48):**  from Hodmedods.  
**[1:14:49-1:14:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:14:49):**  I don't know if you've heard of Hodmedods.  
**[1:14:52-1:14:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:14:52):**  No, I've been using Forest Whole Foods, which you've kind of been ordering from there.  
**[1:14:57-1:14:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:14:57):**  Oh, okay.  
**[1:14:58-1:15:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:14:58):**  I'll be grateful of any recommendations.  
**[1:15:00-1:15:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:15:00):**  I'll put them in the show notes as well.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:15:02):**  We can have that in there.  
**[1:15:03-1:15:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:15:03):**  So that's great.  
**[1:15:04-1:15:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:15:04):**  Okay, yeah.  
**[1:15:05-1:15:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:15:05):**  So yeah, so Hodmedods, they specifically are working to build regenerative practices into  
**[1:15:11-1:15:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:15:11):**  farming around the UK and to build a market for pulses so that farmers in the UK can grow  
**[1:15:17-1:15:21](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:15:17):**  pulses, build soil health and have a good market for that.  
**[1:15:21-1:15:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:15:21):**  So they're a good one to buy pulses from.  
**[1:15:25-1:15:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:15:25):**  And they also do flour so you can get this really brilliant wheat from them that is actually  
**[1:15:33-1:15:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:15:33):**  a really diverse wheat.  
**[1:15:35-1:15:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:15:35):**  Okay.  
**[1:15:36-1:15:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:15:36):**  So that's called YQ or yeah, you should if you listen to the serial series, you'll understand  
**[1:15:44-1:15:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:15:44):**  everything about YQ by the end of it.  
**[1:15:49-1:16:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:15:49):**  And then, I don't know, in terms of meat, there's people like the Ethical Butcher online.  
**[1:16:00-1:16:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:00):**  There's something called Pasture for Life.  
**[1:16:03-1:16:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:03):**  Maybe you already know about them.  
**[1:16:06-1:16:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:06):**  I know there's green pastures that might be the same people and they're looking at grass  
**[1:16:12-1:16:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:12):**  fed to grass slaughter.  
**[1:16:14-1:16:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:14):**  And I think you can go to the farm and visit.  
**[1:16:19-1:16:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:19):**  Cool.  
**[1:16:20-1:16:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:20):**  And then there's the wild community around meats, isn't there?  
**[1:16:25-1:16:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:25):**  Yeah, totally.  
**[1:16:26-1:16:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:26):**  Like the Wild Meat Company and people like that, that are going back into that.  
**[1:16:30-1:16:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:30):**  Yeah.  
**[1:16:31-1:16:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:31):**  Well, what I would say about Pasture for Life is it's a farmer led organization and they're  
**[1:16:37-1:16:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:37):**  basically some of the most pioneering farmers in the UK.  
**[1:16:40-1:16:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:40):**  And they're really pushing the bounds of regenerative farming.  
**[1:16:45-1:16:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:45):**  And so if you go on the Pasture for Life website, it shows you all the different farmers that  
**[1:16:50-1:16:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:50):**  are part of their group.  
**[1:16:51-1:16:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:51):**  And then you could go, if there's a farmer near you, you could go visit them and have  
**[1:16:55-1:16:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:55):**  a conversation.  
**[1:16:56-1:17:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:16:56):**  And you can also start to, if you do want to buy any meat products, you can buy them  
**[1:17:00-1:17:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:17:00):**  from them.  
**[1:17:02-1:17:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:17:02):**  And then you can know when you're eating the meat that it's actually like potentially even  
**[1:17:06-1:17:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:17:06):**  carbon positive in the sense that a lot of those farms are showing that they can actually  
**[1:17:12-1:17:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:17:12):**  sequester more carbon than they produce.  
**[1:17:14-1:17:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:17:14):**  Yes, sorry, we didn't cover this.  
**[1:17:16-1:17:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:17:16):**  Can we go into this?  
**[1:17:18-1:17:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:17:18):**  So that's holistic management, isn't it?  
**[1:17:20-1:17:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:17:20):**  Where you move the ruminants around the land.  
**[1:17:26-1:17:27](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:17:26):**  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[1:17:27-1:17:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:17:27):**  So basically, there's many different names for it.  
**[1:17:31-1:17:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:17:31):**  One's holistic management.  
**[1:17:33-1:17:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:17:33):**  And what, and many Pasture for Life farmers are doing this.  
**[1:17:37-1:17:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:17:37):**  And what they do is they have their animals together in herds.  
**[1:17:45-1:17:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:17:45):**  And they do it, you know, it's replicating this, the way animals existed on the savannahs.  
**[1:17:51-1:17:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:17:51):**  And really, it was kind of Ellen Savory, who of the Savory Institute, who had this insight,  
**[1:17:58-1:18:03](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:17:58):**  which is that, you know, on the savannahs, animals, they group together in herds for  
**[1:18:03-1:18:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:18:03):**  safety, and then they move on all the time.  
**[1:18:07-1:18:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:18:07):**  And so the way that the vegetation has evolved and the way grasses have evolved is to have  
**[1:18:12-1:18:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:18:12):**  this kind of intensive eating period of many animals in one place, and then to be rested  
**[1:18:18-1:18:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:18:18):**  for, you know, a month, two months, maybe three months before those animals return again.  
**[1:18:24-1:18:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:18:24):**  And so that what they found is that when you graze in that way, so you actually start to  
**[1:18:32-1:18:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:18:32):**  really build your soil health and your soil carbon.  
**[1:18:35-1:18:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:18:35):**  Because the plants, they, when they're eaten down to a certain level, and then left for  
**[1:18:41-1:18:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:18:41):**  a long time, it increases, they photosynthesize more and they put more carbon into the soil.  
**[1:18:48-1:18:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:18:48):**  Yeah, I heard the addition to that is that you, there is if the farmer takes on the role  
**[1:18:55-1:18:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:18:55):**  of like, what would be the apex predator to herd them into that position.  
**[1:18:59-1:19:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:18:59):**  That's right.  
**[1:19:00-1:19:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:00):**  And so that's what happens.  
**[1:19:01-1:19:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:01):**  And then they poop and they pee and they stamp all that into the ground.  
**[1:19:05-1:19:06](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:05):**  Exactly.  
**[1:19:06-1:19:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:06):**  In that one area.  
**[1:19:07-1:19:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:07):**  So that's the fertilizer coming.  
**[1:19:08-1:19:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:08):**  I mean, again, it's like, understand that as a simple system.  
**[1:19:13-1:19:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:13):**  It is so simple.  
**[1:19:16-1:19:20](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:16):**  Yeah, and many farmers doing they use electric fencing to, you know, keep the animals into  
**[1:19:20-1:19:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:20):**  a very herd like area and then they move them regularly.  
**[1:19:26-1:19:29](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:26):**  So also, I mean, the other side of it is the animals, you know, if they're not put on the  
**[1:19:29-1:19:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:29):**  same bit of grass, again, like particularly sheep for a while, they don't get parasites,  
**[1:19:34-1:19:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:34):**  you don't need to worm them.  
**[1:19:36-1:19:40](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:36):**  There's like, they don't need antibiotics often because they don't get the same disease  
**[1:19:40-1:19:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:40):**  pressures.  
**[1:19:41-1:19:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:41):**  So like, there's a whole host of other benefits that farmers are finding.

**[1:19:47-1:19:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:47):**  Yeah, the animals.  
**[1:19:48-1:19:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:48):**  Exactly.  
**[1:19:49-1:19:53](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:49):**  So yeah, it is huge.  
**[1:19:53-1:19:55](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:53):**  Really important.  
**[1:19:55-1:19:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:55):**  It really is.  
**[1:19:58-1:19:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:58):**  Yeah.  
**[1:19:59-1:20:00](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:19:59):**  It's exciting.  
**[1:20:00-1:20:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:00):**  So yeah, in terms of what people can do, buying from animals grown in those systems is really  
**[1:20:07-1:20:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:07):**  important, I would say.  
**[1:20:10-1:20:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:10):**  Yeah.  
**[1:20:11-1:20:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:11):**  So is there, so say with this new, is it new legislations that's changing now because of  
**[1:20:17-1:20:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:17):**  the EU?  
**[1:20:18-1:20:19](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:18):**  Yeah.  
**[1:20:19-1:20:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:19):**  I mean, how do we, is there a way that we can support this with the farmers?  
**[1:20:26-1:20:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:26):**  Because again, as I say, I mean, only because we're with Riverfoot that we actually heard  
**[1:20:30-1:20:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:30):**  anything about this bill being passed or looking to be passed.  
**[1:20:34-1:20:37](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:34):**  That's the only time I heard about it.  
**[1:20:37-1:20:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:37):**  So and we're not going to pick up on it in mainstream media.  
**[1:20:44-1:20:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:44):**  Is there, where do people turn to?  
**[1:20:45-1:20:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:45):**  Where do they go to and how can they get, do you aware of how we can get involved in  
**[1:20:49-1:20:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:49):**  that?  
**[1:20:50-1:20:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:50):**  Yeah.  
**[1:20:51-1:20:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:51):**  So I mean, there is like an organization called Sustain and they're really good for lobbying  
**[1:20:58-1:21:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:20:58):**  for better food and better farming.  
**[1:21:02-1:21:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:21:02):**  And so if you follow Sustain, they will always be sharing of like the policy that they, you  
**[1:21:07-1:21:18](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:21:07):**  know, they're always sharing different petitions or change.org campaigns that we should sign.  
**[1:21:18-1:21:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:21:18):**  And certainly right now, I guess the thing to be watching and the whole farming community  
**[1:21:23-1:21:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:21:23):**  is worried about this, is that as new trade deals happen and obviously the current government  
**[1:21:30-1:21:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:21:30):**  seemed very keen on a trade deal with the United States.  
**[1:21:35-1:21:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:21:35):**  What's really in question is the quality of the food imports that are going to be allowed  
**[1:21:41-1:21:49](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:21:41):**  in and very much the farming community here in the UK are pushing for that only food that  
**[1:21:49-1:21:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:21:49):**  is produced to the standards we already have in the UK should be allowed to be brought  
**[1:21:54-1:21:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:21:54):**  into the UK, which was how it was when we were in the EU.  
**[1:21:59-1:22:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:21:59):**  However, they tried to get that put into law in the agricultural bill and it was voted  
**[1:22:08-1:22:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:22:08):**  down.  
**[1:22:11-1:22:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:22:11):**  So now, you know, we need to keep our eyes and ears open as the trade bills come or as  
**[1:22:16-1:22:23](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:22:16):**  trade negotiations happen that we really rally to ensure that, you know, the government knows  
**[1:22:23-1:22:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:22:23):**  that people are not up for lower quality food in this country.  
**[1:22:28-1:22:32](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:22:28):**  And so we need to have our voices heard about that.  
**[1:22:32-1:22:38](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:22:32):**  And then the only other thing to mention that is currently in debate after leaving the EU  
**[1:22:38-1:22:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:22:38):**  is also about GM foods and growing genetically modified crops in this country or genetically  
**[1:22:48-1:22:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:22:48):**  altered crops.  
**[1:22:50-1:22:56](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:22:50):**  And certainly that's, you know, there's a divide on that in the farming community.  
**[1:22:56-1:23:02](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:22:56):**  And at the moment, it seems like the NFU, the National Farmers Union is trying to or  
**[1:23:02-1:23:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:23:02):**  is supporting legislation that would allow for that to be grown in the UK.  
**[1:23:10-1:23:16](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:23:10):**  And I certainly am not pro that mainly because to me, that's more of this monoculture idea.  
**[1:23:16-1:23:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:23:16):**  Like if you're genetically modifying seeds, that means that you're then replicating them.  
**[1:23:22-1:23:28](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:23:22):**  And so you're just putting lots of the same genetic information into the field.  
**[1:23:28-1:23:31](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:23:28):**  And so it's just more of this monoculture system.  
**[1:23:31-1:23:35](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:23:31):**  And that's what we're trying to move away from, not towards.  
**[1:23:35-1:23:39](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:23:35):**  So yeah, so those are the two things that are very impressive practices.  
**[1:23:39-1:23:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:23:39):**  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  
**[1:23:41-1:23:44](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:23:41):**  So that's sustained, sustained.  
**[1:23:44-1:23:45](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:23:44):**  They're lobbying for better food.  
**[1:23:45-1:23:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:23:45):**  And we, as an individual can look at that and help support perhaps.  
**[1:23:51-1:23:52](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:23:51):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[1:23:52-1:23:59](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:23:52):**  And Sustainable Food Trust is another one that's good to follow for this kind of information.  
**[1:23:59-1:24:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:23:59):**  Because I often get a little bit lost in it.  
**[1:24:01-1:24:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:01):**  It's like, you know, when you someone says, okay, this is happening, and this happening,  
**[1:24:04-1:24:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:04):**  this happening.  
**[1:24:05-1:24:08](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:05):**  And Riverford was a classic example of that.  
**[1:24:08-1:24:10](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:08):**  And I read the whole thing that was like, well, now what?  
**[1:24:10-1:24:11](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:10):**  What do we do?  
**[1:24:11-1:24:13](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:11):**  You know, how do we help?  
**[1:24:13-1:24:15](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:13):**  And how do we support this?  
**[1:24:15-1:24:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:15):**  How do we support the farmer?  
**[1:24:17-1:24:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:17):**  So that's, yeah, that's kind of that feels like that's missing from the conversation,  
**[1:24:22-1:24:24](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:22):**  you know.  
**[1:24:24-1:24:25](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:24):**  Totally agree.  
**[1:24:25-1:24:30](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:25):**  And I think another thing is just, you know, many farms do have like, holiday places on  
**[1:24:30-1:24:34](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:30):**  their farm, they'll have like converted a barn.  
**[1:24:34-1:24:41](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:34):**  So if you are able to, you know, going and staying on a farm, it's a really nice way  
**[1:24:41-1:24:47](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:41):**  to engage and to learn what's really happening out in the fields of the United Kingdom and  
**[1:24:47-1:24:50](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:47):**  how you can be involved in that.  
**[1:24:50-1:24:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:50):**  Yeah.  
**[1:24:51-1:24:57](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:51):**  So that's another nice way and other than just, you know, buying from Farmers Direct  
**[1:24:57-1:24:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:57):**  where you can.  
**[1:24:58-1:25:04](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:24:58):**  And I think, you know, obviously Riverford, they offer a great service of good quality  
**[1:25:04-1:25:05](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:25:04):**  organic vegetables being delivered.  
**[1:25:05-1:25:09](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:25:05):**  And I mean, you know, they are a great farming organisation.  
**[1:25:09-1:25:17](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:25:09):**  Yeah, are there, is there almost like a register of regenerative farmers?  
**[1:25:17-1:25:22](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:25:17):**  Yeah, well, actually, I can't believe I haven't mentioned it yet.  
**[1:25:22-1:25:26](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:25:22):**  There is, so there's a new database.  
**[1:25:26-1:25:33](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:25:26):**  So in response to COVID, there's this new database called Farms to Feed Us.  
**[1:25:33-1:25:36](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:25:33):**  Farms to Feed Us, there you go.  
**[1:25:36-1:25:42](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:25:36):**  And so they have many different farms on there around the UK, so all over.  
**[1:25:42-1:25:48](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:25:42):**  And it's a way of basically being, getting in direct contact with different farmers who  
**[1:25:48-1:25:51](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:25:48):**  are growing or producing different things.  
**[1:25:51-1:25:54](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:25:51):**  Some of them have websites, some of them just have phone numbers.  
**[1:25:54-1:25:58](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:25:54):**  And you can just go on the database and find things that are local to you or different  
**[1:25:58-1:26:01](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:25:58):**  people that deliver nationwide as well.  
**[1:26:01-1:26:07](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:26:01):**  And that's an amazing way to really break out of the supermarket paradigm and to really  
**[1:26:07-1:26:12](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:26:07):**  start to engage with buying direct from farmers and different producers.  
**[1:26:12-1:26:14](https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Abby-Rose---Regenerative-Farming-and-Our-Natural-Norms-eotbl2#t=1:26:12):**  It's really, I think that's really exciting.

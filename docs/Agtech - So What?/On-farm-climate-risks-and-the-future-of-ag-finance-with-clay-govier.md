**[0:00:35-0:00:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:00:35):**  year and on the heels of drought, floods and excess heat, a different kind of uncertainty,  
**[0:00:41-0:00:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:00:41):**  rising interest rates is also apparent.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:00:43):**  I really think in the next 10 years there is going to be a ton of ground for sale, just  
**[0:00:48-0:00:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:00:48):**  tons.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:00:49):**  I don't want to have a five or $10 million note with my local bank.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:00:52):**  If I can mitigate some of that risk or reduce the interest payments in some fashion.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:00:59):**  That's Clay Govier, a Nebraska farmer growing a diversified mix of grains on irrigated ground.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:01:06):**  Clay was on my radar for a couple of reasons.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:01:08):**  One, the weather extremes this year have been truly wild.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:01:12):**  And I wanted to hear more about how he's thinking about dealing with those risks.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:01:16):**  And as a key part of that, I wanted to learn more about his growth strategy and specifically  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:01:20):**  how he thinks about financial risk and where it collides with environmental ones.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:01:25):**  If we received three or four inches of snow last winter, that was probably it.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:01:29):**  So it had been from last October until the end of April and we hadn't received any measurable  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:01:36):**  precipitation of any kind.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:01:38):**  So it was bad for pastures, bad for your cattle producers, bad for any crop ground that is  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:01:44):**  not irrigated.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:01:45):**  We did catch a few timely rains in the middle of the season.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:01:48):**  I think just enough to give us like some hope.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:01:51):**  And then it just, it stopped in the first half of July and it's just been super hot  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:01:55):**  and super dry ever since then.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:01:58):**  So it's been a pretty challenging year just from not getting enough rain.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:02:03):**  Plus when we do get rain, it seems like it comes with just crazy wind.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:02:09):**  My hometown of Broken Bow, we had a wind event that they registered, I think it might have  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:02:14):**  been 93 miles an hour.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:02:15):**  It did a lot of damage, a lot of center pivots were flipped over, grain bins were lost.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:02:22):**  There's a lot of infrastructure damage, not to mention blows corn over at that point,  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:02:25):**  you get a lot of green snap and just damage to your crops.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:02:28):**  So there's a lot of additional stress on the crops.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:02:32):**  So even if they are irrigated crops and we can control the rainfall from that perspective,  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:02:37):**  there's just so much extra stress from just weeks of 100 plus days and it just doesn't  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:02:43):**  cool off at night to no rain to tons of wind and quite a bit of hail.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:02:49):**  We had to replant quite a bit of crops and we didn't have it nearly as bad as a lot of  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:02:55):**  farmers in this area.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:02:56):**  And across Nebraska, the whole state just got beat up this year.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:00):**  And what are the kind of, I guess, strategies you can use?  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:03):**  I imagine there's some stuff in season, like you said, you can replant, you can think about  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:06):**  how to salvage what's there.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:07):**  What do you kind of do both in season and longer term?  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:11):**  Are there changes that you might consider?  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:13):**  There's a variety of things.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:14):**  Crop insurance is probably the number one thing, right?  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:17):**  Your subsidized federal crop insurance is what saves you a lot of times in years like  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:22):**  this.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:23):**  And then there's private insurance.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:24):**  So you can buy extra wind or extra hail insurance to give yourself even more protection.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:30):**  We tried to diversify some of our cropping rotation instead of just, you know, higher  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:36):**  value corn, soybeans, like we might plant.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:40):**  We plant a certain amount of cereal rye that we grow for grain that we then sell for cover  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:44):**  crop seed.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:45):**  So we can add value to that instead of just selling it unclean out of the field to somebody.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:50):**  We can run it through our cleaner, add a couple bucks of value to the grain.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:03:55):**  We grow some yellow field peas, and this was not a great year for that, but it's kind of  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:01):**  a low input crop and then it does some good stuff for the soil.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:07):**  So your following crop is typically better off because of planting peas.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:12):**  Yellow peas might be a break even deal the year that you plant them and harvest them,  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:16):**  but you know, then the next year you can cut some of your fertilizer inputs and maybe recoup  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:21):**  a little bit more.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:22):**  It's just, it's not a direct plus or minus.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:26):**  So it's hard to say, oh yeah, I'm saving 40 bucks next year by planting peas this year.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:31):**  It's not necessarily that direct of a correlation.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:34):**  Anecdotally, I've seen it enough times.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:36):**  I'm like, I know I'm doing the right thing.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:38):**  It's just hard to quantify, which is pretty frustrating.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:42):**  What's the conversation like with the kind of live examples of weather and variable climate  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:48):**  you've seen this year?  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:50):**  People talk about pressure on sustainability.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:51):**  Are people talking about climate change or people talking about consumers?  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:55):**  I guess what's the vibe on this stuff in terms of are people like saying, oh, we're going  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:04:59):**  to be able to keep doing what we've been doing unless there's regulations or we can't do  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:05:03):**  what we've been doing because of the weather and climate change or how normal is your view?  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:05:08):**  I guess if this conversation you're having at the bar, does everyone agree with you or  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:05:12):**  are you thinking pretty differently about this?  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:05:14):**  So I was just at Husker Harvest Days, which is a pretty big farm show in Central Nebraska.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:05:19):**  And there's a lot more normal, like just casual conversation about climate change being a  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:05:25):**  thing and how are we going to manage it or adapt to it, figure out how to live with it.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:05:31):**  I would say in the last two to three years, I've heard way more than the 10 years before  
**[0:05:38-0:05:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:05:38):**  that.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:05:39):**  And I've been beating the drum for quite a while.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:05:42):**  And I just think when you talk to an old timer and they're like, boy, you can't even predict  
**[0:05:46-0:05:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:05:46):**  the weather anymore.

**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:05:52):**  85 degree temperatures in February, but then April and May are cold.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:05:58):**  And then June is 30 straight days of 100 degree temperatures with 50 mile an hour winds.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:06:05):**  It's just really volatile and pretty tough to manage.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:06:09):**  And this year was exceptionally hot.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:06:11):**  We had triple digit temperatures in Nebraska in the middle of September.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:06:17):**  Almost fall.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:06:18):**  And I like, sure, yeah, we beat the previous record by one or two degrees.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:06:22):**  So yeah, like 70 years ago it was hot.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:06:24):**  But I think the previous record was during Dust Bowl time, 1934, 36, something like that.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:06:31):**  I don't think people appreciate that Nebraska would be in a severe Dust Bowl if it wasn't  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:06:35):**  for the amount of irrigation that we have.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:06:38):**  We change our regional environment by pumping billions, if not trillions of gallons of water  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:06:44):**  out of the ground every year.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:06:46):**  So getting back to your question, as far as like, how do you manage it?  
**[0:06:50-0:06:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:06:50):**  Part of what we're doing is planting different species.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:06:53):**  So if you're planting rye, that's a cool season grass.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:06:56):**  If you're planting peas, that's a cool season legume.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:06:59):**  Everybody plants corn and beans, which are both warm season.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:07:03):**  So if you have a really cold spring or early frost or something like that is going to be  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:07:09):**  really hard on those crops.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:07:11):**  So I think rotational diversity is also a way to manage that risk.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:07:17):**  One of the areas I wanted to ask you about was growth ambitions for you guys and the  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:07:22):**  kind of finance support that you have to enable those growth decisions.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:07:26):**  So maybe just start with a little bit of overview of the operation and then we can zoom into  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:07:31):**  how you guys think about growth expansion and whatever that means to you.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:07:35):**  So we farm roughly 3,500 acres.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:07:39):**  I would say 70% of that we own and have owned it for a long time.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:07:45):**  I'm fifth generation on this farm.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:07:48):**  Definitely fortunate in that we don't have a lot of long-term debt from buying a lot  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:07:54):**  of expensive land in the last 10 years.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:07:56):**  We have expanded quite a bit.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:07:58):**  I would say probably close to a thousand acres in the last 10 years since I've been back  
**[0:08:02-0:08:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:08:02):**  on the farm.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:08:03):**  And I don't know how much bigger we really want to be.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:08:06):**  We can grow cereal rye, but then we get a cleaner and we can add value to that grain  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:08:11):**  by cleaning it and then selling it locally or wherever it needs to go.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:08:16):**  But we can add value through a little enterprise within our organization or our farm.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:08:21):**  So I kind of like that idea from an expansion standpoint, not necessarily farming more and  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:08:29):**  more and more acres, but trying to do it in a way that is more profitable.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:08:34):**  So as far as like financially, we're in a pretty good position.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:08:37):**  We don't have a lot or if any long-term debt.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:08:40):**  Yeah, you're paying some notes on a new tractor or something like that, but I don't have to  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:08:44):**  worry about paying off a couple of million dollars on a land note or something.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:08:48):**  So I could go to my local bank, which is where we get our line of credit.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:08:52):**  And so far we've just went to our local bank just because that's where we've been for the  
**[0:08:56-0:08:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:08:56):**  last 40, 50 years or whatever.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:08:59):**  Is that an ag bank or just a generic bank, but local?  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:09:03):**  It's just a local bank.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:09:04):**  So they have the retail business side too, but I would say the bulk of their business  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:09:07):**  is in ag, whether it's farming or ranching.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:09:11):**  But we've looked at say like FBNs offerings too.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:09:14):**  They've had really good interest rates and we do buy some products through FBN.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:09:19):**  So we do have a line of credit with them, but it's just for the products that they sell  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:09:24):**  because oftentimes if you buy their stuff and you have a line of credit with them, it's  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:09:30):**  0% interest for a year or something if you're buying seed or herbicide or whatever from  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:09:36):**  them.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:09:37):**  So if I'm buying FBN products, I am definitely leveraging that line of credit.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:09:42):**  Now if I'm going out to buy a tractor, John Deere has, they have a humongous financial  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:09:47):**  arm within that organization.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:09:49):**  We finance equipment if it's a big piece of equipment and that always depends on what  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:09:52):**  the accountants say and stuff like that.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:09:54):**  But I would say the bulk of our financing is either through our local bank or FBN and  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:10:00):**  we're pretty much all green paint.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:10:02):**  So we do stuff through John Deere Financial too.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:10:05):**  Tell me the playbook, if you were explaining it to someone new to the industry for how  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:10:09):**  you came to expand the way your family did and own sort of 70% of what you guys farm,  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:10:15):**  how would you describe the strategy of we would want to acquire property nearby and  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:10:21):**  we'd think about we should rent versus own versus lease.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:10:24):**  We should use debt in this way.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:10:25):**  What was the expansion playbook to get to where you guys are?  
**[0:10:28-0:10:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:10:28):**  Historically, just having grown up on the farm, dad and grandpa were pretty conservative  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:10:36):**  in their expansion over the last like 30 or 40 years and we just didn't really overextend  
**[0:10:42-0:10:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:10:42):**  ever.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:10:43):**  And just here in the last say 10 years or so, 10, 12 years, it's mostly just been if  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:10:48):**  we've been renting a chunk of ground and the landlord's like, you know what, I don't want  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:10:52):**  to mess with this rent check every year and any of the headaches that brings, I just want  
**[0:10:57-0:10:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:10:57):**  to sell this chunk of ground.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:10:59):**  And so we've been fortunate that we've had landlords just come to us directly and be  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:11:03):**  like, we're not going to put it on for auction.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:11:05):**  We want to sell it.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:11:06):**  We want you to have the first opportunity.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:11:08):**  And some of those things just fell on our laps.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:11:10):**  Other than that, like I say, if a piece of farmland came up for sale and it kind of fit  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:11:18):**  our traffic pattern, like just logistically, it was something right next to another field  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:11:24):**  that we already farmed, then we would be pretty aggressive on something like that.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:11:30):**  And I think that's pretty typical for the average farmer.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:11:33):**  Some of these farms are getting so big that it doesn't matter because every field that  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:11:39):**  comes up for sale is bordering some pretty close to something else that they own.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:11:44):**  So it's just, I do not have the ambition to become like say a 10,000 acre farmer.

**[0:11:50-0:11:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:11:50):**  I wouldn't say that there is any defined strategy on how we want to grow.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:11:58):**  If an opportunity presents itself, we'll just look at if we're sitting on some cash and  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:12:03):**  we want to do something with it, or if it really fits our operation really nice, then  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:12:09):**  we'll really consider it.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:12:10):**  And then just go talk to the banker and, Hey, I need a million dollar loan or whatever.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:12:14):**  And then we can make that happen.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:12:16):**  So that's been like the last 10 years now.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:12:18):**  I think things are going to start getting really interesting in the next 10 years because  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:12:23):**  the demographics of your average farmer is like the age is 58 or something.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:12:28):**  And I would say around here, it's much older than that is your average age of a farmer.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:12:33):**  And I think just here locally, I think this is going to be pretty much industry wide.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:12:38):**  Ground is going to start changing hands a lot faster and a lot more volume.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:12:43):**  And we have a lot of neighbors that like this guy has been farming.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:12:46):**  He's 65, 70, didn't have any children that wanted to come back to the farm.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:12:51):**  They're just thinking, might as well sell it.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:12:53):**  Land prices are high.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:12:55):**  And I think in the next five, 10 years, we're going to see a lot of that.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:12:58):**  So I think there's going to be a lot of opportunities to expand if you're comfortable going into  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:02):**  that.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:03):**  And now the interest rates are actually becoming a little bit more meaningful.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:07):**  In that example where you guys were maybe leasing some land, there was a landlord, they  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:11):**  didn't go to auction and they offered it to you guys.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:14):**  Is the playbook there to go to the bank and finance it that way?  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:18):**  Or are there other options you might consider?  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:20):**  And does that ever not work out where they're selling, but that's a year where you guys  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:25):**  don't have the cash or the kind of economics or the financing options don't make sense?  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:29):**  Since I've been back on the farm, there has not been any sort of problem with financing.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:34):**  Fortunately, if we go to the bank and say, hey, you need a couple of million dollar loan  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:38):**  to buy some more ground, they're going to say, okay, they know what we're worth.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:44):**  Fortunately, we have quite a bit of ground that's paid for.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:47):**  The bank's very comfortable lending to us since we're in that situation.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:51):**  I know there's a lot of farmers that they're more comfortable renting everything and they  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:54):**  just don't have the, they don't want to mess with the taxes and the ownership.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:57):**  They'd rather just write a rent check.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:13:59):**  And that's fine because I think there's a lot of absentee landlords that they don't  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:02):**  want to sell.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:03):**  They want to keep the land that's been in their family for a long time and they want  
**[0:14:06-0:14:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:06):**  to rent it and they want to make money.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:08):**  So that works out pretty well for them.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:10):**  Have you seen any options that look different?  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:13):**  In terms of financing for that expansion, we're looking at a couple people talking about  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:17):**  equity options to maybe access more capital from minority investment partners, whether  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:22):**  you're bringing in someone yourself or going through a platform or something like that  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:25):**  to finance the expansion that way.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:26):**  Is that something you guys have looked at?  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:28):**  We probably haven't looked at it too closely.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:30):**  I know some of those options exist and I guess if it made sense to do that, then certainly  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:38):**  it would be something that we'd look at.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:40):**  For better or worse, we just have such a good relationship with our local bank.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:44):**  That's pretty much what we do.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:45):**  But I've got a friend that works for, I think the company's name is like steward or something  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:49):**  and they're more micro or regenerative ag focused lending.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:54):**  And I've talked to her about what they do and it just doesn't really fit our model that  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:14:59):**  well unless we would, I would say, add on another business, like start building some  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:15:04):**  greenhouses or something along those lines.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:15:06):**  Plus oftentimes we just don't need the financing fortunately.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:15:10):**  But yeah, there's beginning to be a lot more options.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:15:13):**  My brothers are using the military.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:15:15):**  I know that there's some stuff that you could probably leverage that way, whether it's financing  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:15:19):**  or just like various government programs.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:15:22):**  There's energy grants, there's like through the NRCS, you can do all sorts of more conservation  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:15:26):**  ag programs that you can get quite a bit of money through as well.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:15:30):**  Sometimes I look at like just pure financing.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:15:33):**  People think, okay, you're looking for a loan.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:15:34):**  I can also go out and maybe find a NRCS program or some sort of company that is throwing money  
**[0:15:42-0:15:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:15:42):**  at different sustainability projects or something.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:15:45):**  You can kind of leverage some of those other funding sources besides just going for a normal  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:15:50):**  traditional loan.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:15:51):**  Are you starting to see more, do you think there will be more of that kind of tying of  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:15:57):**  options to practices even more around the various tools in the toolkit for managing  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:16:03):**  risk, whether that's input costs or timing or cropping systems?  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:16:07):**  Like I could imagine that if I was a financier, that approach would be more attractive for  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:16:13):**  me to finance than someone who isn't thinking about that breadth of tools in the toolkit.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:16:17):**  Just from a risk perspective, do you see any kind of more recognition of that in terms  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:16:22):**  of the access to finance that you guys would get?  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:16:25):**  Yes and no.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:16:26):**  Like your traditional financing going through our local bank, they don't have a bunch of  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:16:29):**  shareholders that want them to have like reduce their carbon footprint.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:16:33):**  But I think there's a lot of these alternate funding sources that yeah, they're going to  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:16:37):**  start tying that funding or financing or whatever to your practices or that's the only way you'd  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:16:43):**  even be able to approach them or apply for a loan is if you're already following these  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:16:48):**  practices or if you're going to use that funding to adopt new practices and that's going to  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:16:53):**  cushion the risk a little bit.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:16:56):**  I totally think that's going to become more and more of a thing.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:16:59):**  I really think that some of these government programs right now, they're pretty much all  
**[0:17:04-0:17:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:17:04):**  voluntary.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:17:05):**  I think they subsidize federal crop insurance.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:17:09):**  I can certainly see a day in the not too distant future that you will have to farm in a certain  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:17:17):**  way to qualify for those subsidies.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:17:20):**  So if you're just a corn farmer forever and that's all you do and you do till everything

**[0:18:17-0:18:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:18:17):**  farmers who are looking for another financing option.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:18:20):**  Clay's first reaction was not surprisingly one of a bit of skepticism.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:18:25):**  We're getting enough Wall Street money in farm ground ownership as is.

**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:18:36):**  Like yeah, we're sitting on $500 million that we want to lend to farmers to expand.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:18:42):**  So for me, it would all depend on the terms of this bit of equity that I would be giving  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:18:48):**  them.

**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:18:59):**  So if I say, yeah, this particular chunk of ground right now, our county tax evaluation,  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:19:04):**  like what its assessed value is, whatever, $7,500 an acre.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:19:08):**  And then say I do this and then five years down the road or 10 years down the road, I'm  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:19:13):**  like, you know what, I've got some cash.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:19:15):**  I want to get my ownership back.

**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:19:20):**  I'm sure paying that difference, that's part of their strategy.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:19:24):**  Personally, some of that sounds really appealing to me because it's really hard telling what  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:19:28):**  to do.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:19:29):**  From a land value perspective, what's going to happen in the next 10 years or whatever,  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:19:33):**  but I can certainly see the interest rates are going to go up.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:19:35):**  So for me to go to a bank and get a loan and know that I'm going to pay 6, 7, 8% interest  
**[0:19:42-0:19:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:19:42):**  on that versus I could give part ownership of a particular field, get cash that way.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:19:50):**  And then it spreads the risk a little bit because obviously this equity group is absorbing  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:19:54):**  some of the risk.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:19:55):**  They think that it's going to return obviously, but that's not necessarily the case.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:20:00):**  If land values just really soften, then it sucks for them, but also sucks for the farmer  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:20:04):**  too.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:20:05):**  But it's appealing to me.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:20:07):**  And I think diversifying your financing options is pretty important anymore.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:20:13):**  Just given ground's expensive and I really think in the next 10 years, there is going  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:20:18):**  to be a ton of ground for sale, just tons.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:20:21):**  I don't want to have a five or $10 million note with my local bank if I can mitigate  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:20:26):**  some of that risk or reduce the interest payments in some fashion.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:20:31):**  That makes a lot of sense to me.

**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:20:39):**  The stat that I've heard is that over 70% of land is owned by farmers over 75 years  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:20:44):**  old and that in the US alone, over the next 10 years, over $500 billion of farmland will  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:20:50):**  change hands.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:20:51):**  I certainly do see that slightly alternate financing options are going to become more  
**[0:20:57-0:21:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:20:57):**  and more important in the near future just because I think the sheer amount of land that's  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:21:05):**  going to change hands.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:21:07):**  Around here, there are not very many young guys that are farming.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:21:12):**  I would say 50%.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:21:14):**  If you're looking at like, I'm 40, my dad's 72, there's a lot more guys that are in their  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:21:20):**  60s and 70s that are farming than there are in their 40s.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:21:23):**  Do I really want to expand?  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:21:25):**  Not necessarily, but I don't know who's gonna.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:21:28):**  Who will actually farm this ground that's been farmed for 150 years if somebody doesn't  
**[0:21:35-0:21:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:21:35):**  step up and do it?  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:21:36):**  I don't really want to be a 10,000 acre farmer or a 20,000 acre farmer, but I would not be  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:21:42):**  surprised if I couldn't be there in 10 years if I wanted to be.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:21:48):**  And so having these alternate funding financing sources is going to be 100% necessary because  
**[0:21:55-0:22:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:21:55):**  our farm might be worth $20 million, but to buy another 1,000 acres, you're talking millions  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:02):**  and millions of dollars and you can't do that with just our local bank.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:05):**  So I really do think that some of these more alternate sources of financing are very timely.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:11):**  I mean, it's fascinating too, because what if you don't want to do that, then literally  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:14):**  who buys that land?  
**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:15):**  Does the government buy it?  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:16):**  And then you overlay something with the qualify for subsidies.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:19):**  You have some kind of practice change or whatever requirements that don't exist today.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:23):**  And so that land transitions and then there's probably even less demand to pick up that  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:28):**  ground.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:29):**  So what happens then?  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:30):**  Like you could imagine that the confluence of those factors being pretty interesting  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:33):**  to corporates own it, to food companies buy it, like to the government, like what, yeah,  
**[0:22:37-0:22:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:37):**  what does that look like?  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:38):**  It's crazy to think about.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:39):**  Somebody still has to farm it, but I have seen autonomous, fully autonomous planners  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:42):**  and stuff 10 years ago.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:44):**  I think I could have told you what farming was going to look like in 10 years, give or  
**[0:22:48-0:22:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:48):**  take.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:49):**  I cannot figure out what farming is going to look like in 10 years.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:53):**  Cause I think it's going to be so automated and just really different because we even  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:22:58):**  have automated drones going out and spraying around here.

**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:24:10):**  That's the way the whole industry has been going for the last like 150 years.

**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:24:32):**  There's just no alternative.

**[0:24:38-0:24:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:24:38):**  But at some point if we can start growing more meat in labs or do more plant-based protein

**[0:25:38-0:25:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:25:38):**  and costly in the future.

**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:25:44):**  He sees tremendous opportunity in capital investment on the horizon, despite the risks,

**[0:28:06-0:28:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:28:06):**  we haven't spoken in two years.

**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:29:02):**  Like I want to reignite a bunch of these investor conversations.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:29:05):**  What's the kind of pretense of whatever.

**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:29:09):**  I want to catch up.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:29:10):**  You don't need another one because it's like part of the expectation that founders will  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:29:15):**  make, we'll build relationships with investors and investors will build relationships with

**[0:29:28-0:29:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:29:28):**  I do wonder about that.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:29:30):**  I do wonder about that.

**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:29:37):**  of the email was we're raising against like, great, that's the normal context for you to

**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:29:48):**  absent the here's our update we're raising.

**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/on-farm-climate-risks-and-the-future-of-ag-finance-with-clay-govier#t=0:29:57):**  during that catch up that one of your questions would be, are you raising?

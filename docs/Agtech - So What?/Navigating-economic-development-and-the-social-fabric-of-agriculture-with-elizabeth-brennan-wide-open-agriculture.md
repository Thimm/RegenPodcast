### Agtech - So What?  (2022-00-20)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  I'm Sarah Nolette.  No matter what part of the food or ag sector you might come to know best, I think it's  safe to say that for the vast majority of us, there is way more motivating our work  than just money.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:00:18):**  Our guest today is questioning those motivations, especially in the Australian context.  What I think we have to recognize is what we value and stick true to those values.  So we value that social fabric.  Okay, cool.  So when we think about the future, when we plan for the future, we need to ensure that  
**[0:00:34-0:00:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:00:34):**  any farming system, any ag tech, any future that we want to create holds that value dear.  That's Liz Brennan, a woman with many titles, one of which is the non-executive director  of Wide Open Agriculture, a regenerative food and ag company.  Liz has spent years thinking about national and international systems, about food security,  and about the role of unconventional voices in Australian agriculture.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:00:57):**  She joined us to talk about the whole journey from growing up in the Western Australian  wheat belt through diversions into sports management, wedding planning and green energy,  and eventually to life-changing work in Papua New Guinea.  And I had no idea about PNG, aside largely about connection from a war history context.  But interestingly, PNG is less than four kilometers from Australia.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:01:18):**  So it's unreal that I knew so little about it.  So I moved there for two years, six months after walking Kokoda.  And yeah, just it was that experience alongside doing the Australian Rural Leadership Program,  actually the two most professional formative experiences that I've had.  And it was in both of those experiences that probably two things that kind of cropped up  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:01:40):**  relevant to our conversation.  One, I got interested in food security, and I was fascinated by Papua New Guineans food  production.  Like I knew Broadacre, and I went to PNG and it was developing nation, again, in inverted  commas.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:01:55):**  And these people are more food secure than Australia.  We're on our high horse here in Australia, but I was really struck by Papua New Guineans  and their ag industry and their food security.  So that was where my, I guess, my career started tracking.  And then I guess the other thing that's relevant is that I started to stand up in a leadership  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:02:14):**  context.  And so then came back to Australia and it was probably those three things that I started  really asking questions about why it is that we do the things we do if we've got these  wicked problems that are at our doorstep in the context of ag, in the context of society  globally about how we're going to feed ourselves, then there's got to be a different way.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:02:32):**  Liz began exploring these challenges through a number of lenses, from volunteer leadership  to marketing and regional development to running a consultancy and to her current position  at Wide Open Ag.  But all of that work is still being influenced by the time she spent in PNG, where she says  her first six months were particularly impactful.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:02:49):**  I was up there as part of the then supported Australian Volunteers International Program.  So I was a volunteer because of my marketing business background.  I went up on a two year assignment to work with the PNG Tourism Promotion Authority.  So I was stationed out in the New Guinea Islands.  So what the day looked like, I'd wake up, I lived in a village out of town.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:03:11):**  So I was the only white person in the community, didn't have hot water, didn't have TV, radio  that ants ate out.  So it was pretty rudimentary, but I loved it.  The community that I lived in, I built relationships within the village, and the women looked after  me.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:03:27):**  So I worked with the provincial authority and a lot with provincial government.  And it was the, I guess, the effectively the premier or our equivalent of a premier in  the province that saw the work that I was doing.  And he actually shoulder tapped me to take on other responsibilities within the province.  So certainly, it was interesting being a woman in a context like that, because you're almost  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:03:49):**  a sorry, a white woman, I should say, because you're almost a third gender, I was able to  speak with women in the community on an equal footing, if we say, and similarly with the  men in the community, because I was seen as different and someone that they could connect  with and share with equally as well.  You mentioned they're really food secure.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:04:06):**  What does that look like?  What do they grow and yeah, paint a picture of the ag landscape.  Food security has a number of different metrics, and I guess my take when I went there and  my observation of food security in comparison to Australia, what I knew as someone who grew  up in broadacre ag, the PNG generally is subsistence agriculture, there are export oriented products  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:04:27):**  or commodities such as cocoa, coffee, coconut, balsa wood, for example, that's not necessarily  food crop, but as a cash crop.  So there are export markets, but generally speaking, it's subsistence agriculture, where  the, I guess the supply chains or the food kind of stays within community.  I saw that as a really different way in which Australian ag and broadacre ag operates.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:04:49):**  And we are so dependent on imports, whether it's from another region, another state or  another country.  So the way that I view it was not better or worse, it was just different.  And I thought, gee, so interesting that Papua New Guineans are so eager to learn from us  Australians as a developed nation, yet we have so much to learn from them.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:05:07):**  That's an example of something that Australia or Australian farmers can learn.  I think that's absolutely right.  This kind of hubris around we have to teach them or they often think they can learn from  larger economies, but my instinct is it can go the other way.  What are some examples?  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:05:21):**  I think we've fallen into a trap where we are so attached to economic output and we  forget about the social and environmental impact of what we do.  So in Papua New Guinea, we might, as Australians, we might be really critical.  If someone doesn't show up for work and we value work, like work is your title is who  you are in our society.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:05:40):**  Yeah.  I had staff whom when it was time to harvest a particular crop or when, you know, someone  say this tongue in cheek, but it's sometimes it felt like someone's auntie's dogs, grandfather's  great grandchild died and they went to a funeral.  You're like, oh, gee, come on, we got work to do.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:05:58):**  But it's that real social fabric that has no one goes hungry in PNG.  Sorry, I say that statement loosely.  People look out for each other.  I think that Australian ag, we don't and I hear it again and again, farmers don't feel  valued.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:06:13):**  And I would argue that it's because we place most of our value in the economic output and  not on the social fabric and the environmental impact that we're having on our landscapes,  on our country.  So I think our philosophical approach to ag is different and it's and I understand why.  I understand green revolution.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:06:32):**  I understand why it is that this, we have ended up with the outcomes that we have in  the Australian ag industry.  And I think we can change.  There's a tension between technology or like you mentioned, the green revolution, there's  modern farming techniques that arguably could help with how easy it is to farm, how much  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:06:52):**  food they could produce.  And yet can you still maintain that social fabric and environmental benefits or are those  this kind of technology and progress at odds with some of those core values?  I think it's a healthy tension because I think it actually has this question, what it is  that we value.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:07:06):**  And I think we can't go backwards to the way things were in a really, what's the word I'm  looking for?  Nostalgic sense.  What I think we have to recognise is what we value and stick true to those values.  So we value that social fabric.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:07:19):**  Okay, cool.  So when we think about the future, when we plan for the future, we need to ensure that  any farming system, any ag tech, any future that we want to create holds that value dear.  Not from a nostalgic, I want to go back to the way things were, but from no, this is  important to us and whatever future that we create that at the heart of it.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:07:39):**  So they're right, as we've seen right across Australia and our family farm and no longer,  sorry, our family are no longer involved in broadacre.  We're still involved in hort and we are a result of that consolidation of broadacre  properties, of broadacre land.  And I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing, but we've got to be mindful that when  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:07:58):**  we think about the future, we want the ag, we've got to plan for the things that we value  and we want to get what we want for our future generations.  That impact word has come up a couple of times.  Do you think about that as environmental, as social, as women in ag, what's the impact  you're trying to see?  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:08:14):**  When I think about impact, I really think, how can I use my privilege, my education,  my position in society, my position in the ag industry.  But I guess the other thing, and it really hit home for me when I was in PNG and saw  food security was, I was really surprised.  My colleagues, many of my colleagues are really overweight.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:08:34):**  My Papua New Guinea colleagues, and I'm going, wow, you've got this abundance of food and  fresh fruit, like fresh produce just there in your home garden, your market garden.  How is it that a PNG has some of the highest non-communicable disease rates in the world?  And it was this really interesting system of factors that influences an individual's  diet in PNG, some of which was international trade, which sounds really weird, but it was  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:09:01):**  that Australia and New Zealand were on the back of the sheep, producing all this sheep  meat.  We had these fatty offcuts that we had a trade relationship with the UK that that folded.  And we then had this product we needed to put somewhere.  So we dumped it into Pacific nations, I should say.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:09:18):**  And Pacific nations got a taste for this really fatty offcut of meat and developed a really  unhealthy relationship with this product.  So much so that it displaced traditional diet and they then askewed traditional diet for  preference for these fatty offcuts.  And that's just one factor.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:09:35):**  And then with the close relationship, for example, that PNG has with Australia, Papua  New Guineans want to be like Australia.  And so they askew traditional diets for rice and tinned product, which is all well and  good, but it sets up this really unsustainable model.  If we look at diet like a model.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:09:53):**  And so I then I was like, wow, and that's just diet.  And it's been affected by international trade and policy and what Papua New Guineans are  influenced by.  And so it was that kind of example that I got really interested in.  So just this one little thing is part of a whole system.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:10:10):**  And yet we create policy that's just about increasing yield, simplifying ag policy, but  it's like, and that's where we go.  And we can't say that ag is so intricately linked to health and to social policy and  to the medical field.  And so I was like, but if we solve X, we create Y.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:10:29):**  And if we don't deal with Y, then it creates this whole minefield of issues that we then  have more issues to deal with.  So we actually need to consider the whole system.  It's ag is obviously natural systems and supply chains.  There are so many unintended consequences.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:10:44):**  And yet in probably too many boardrooms and policymaking arenas, it's like just a linear  set of thinking and you lead to these really perverse outcomes.  How does it play out to come in with a systems view in some of these rooms where people just  want a black and white answer and an action that's going to happen tomorrow and show up  on the quarterly earnings report this month?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:11:05):**  I've learnt being in boardrooms, the need to be strategic.  So you might plant a seed on day one, but it might be a day 100 before you can actually  see that seed emerge, shall we say, because I'm well aware that if I was to come in a  bit to your point before about the hippie coming from PNG and espousing all these great  ideas, you need to be able to ensure that what you have to say is fit for purpose in  
**[0:11:31-0:11:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:11:31):**  the audience.  It resonates with them because it's all in good for the speaker to say this, but it's  actually got to resonate with the audience.  And I think that's definitely a tactic I've used in leadership positions that I've had  because I've often been the woman or the young person.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:11:47):**  So I've often ticked two criteria and I used to get really offended by people saying, we  want you because you're a woman and it helps that you're young.  And I'm now broaching out of that young phase.  I'm not really young, sorry, I am still young at Harness, but there are a lot of younger  people coming up in this generation that have got just amazing skills that we need to be  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:12:11):**  ensuring that we're listening to and having part of our decision-making.  So I've often found, I feel like I've been a bit of a Trojan horse and yes, I can come  in as a Trojan horse and explode, but is that the best use of my privilege and position?  So I'm very intentional and very strategic about how it is that I do things.  I'm planning things, having conversations and ensuring that what I have to say is listened  
**[0:12:35-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:12:35):**  to.  I imagine you have this experience too.  I know I do have a lot of people also wanting to have an impact in thinking about agriculture,  whether it's food security, whether it's climate change, drought, regional communities as an  ag as a place for impact.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:12:51):**  When you think about giving them advice, do you see a tension between this systems view  and I guess what I might challenge you to say is a disparate set of things that you're  doing like a bunch of different levers you're trying to pull versus pick one thing and focus  and do that for 20 years or 30 years or solve one problem.  Do you get those questions and how do you give advice between kind of do a bunch of  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:13:12):**  things versus pick one thing and focus?  Yeah, I think both have their merit and this is what I love about our society.  We have a real diversity of skills and skillsets and abilities.  I view my skillset very much at the top of the tea, very like I've got a broad set of  skills.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:13:30):**  I'm a jill of all trades.  I'm not a technical expert and I think it's important to have both because a technical  expert will be able to answer some really specific hard questions that do require a  lot of investment in time and resources and brain power and then you also need the people  that spread across the top of the tea that understand the systems and can see how all  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:13:51):**  of those teas or all those silos shall we say are important and linked together.  So in terms of whether how I would give advice it's to understand where your skillset is,  how you see your skillset, how you see you prefer to work and want to contribute and  the levers that I seek to pull are fairly, they are intentional and I do try and ensure  that I stay focused because I'm a bowerbird of exciting projects and things to get involved  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:14:25):**  in but I'm also very intentional.  And I understand how I like to work and so that was the advice that I would give to others  is to understand where it is that they see what they're interested, where they see they  can add the most value, where they can create the impact that they want to create.  I guess the journey that I've been on, I'll be curious if this resonates, is as you start  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:14:45):**  to have more of a voice and more recognition and more things to say and more confidence  to say them you get asked to do more things and so there's no shortage of help, be on  this advisory committee, be on this board, come speak at this thing and I found the tension  between the excitement around that and the ego around that versus the weight, the impact  I want to have is actually not saying yes to all those things but staying focused on  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:15:07):**  doing these things.  Do you feel that tension at all?  All of the time and it's really interesting that you mentioned ego because I was offered  an opportunity politically a couple of years ago and I went wow that is a big deal and  I called up a dear friend of mine who has experience in the political sphere and she  
**[0:15:28-0:15:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:15:28):**  said to me, yeah she called out ego, she's like you're doing this because your ego thinks  you're really flattered and whatnot or is it because you want to create impact in it  and it was like in that instant I was like I'm not interested in this, why did I even  think of this that this would be a good idea?  This sounds like hell and it was my ego that was responding and I guess the other thing

I said I was interested in this six months ago, does this align?  And do you ever feel the like women haven't always gotten asked to be in those rooms or  
**[0:16:08-0:16:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:16:08):**  young women haven't always gotten asked to be in those rooms and so there's the I need  to say yes to this because I feel the weight of being there and representing you know women  and ex women in ag, young women in ag, regional women in ag, whatever it might be, does that  ever feel like a I don't know both an opportunity and a bit of a tension?  Yes and I think probably earlier in my career I had more I don't know if guilt's the right  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:16:30):**  word but there was a motivation because I saw that a shift needed to be made and I thought  strike wild irons hot so to speak if they're up for it then they're up for it but then  I think the other thing as I built my muscle around how it is that we view diversity in  a decision-making context whether it's the boardroom, a committee, even a project or  a work team so two things ensuring that gender's not just the metric we look to when we consider  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:16:54):**  diversity and what I really try and influence is the culture that a decision-making context  has I'm not the all body seeing oracle on women like I am a woman but my lived experience  is a lived experience and also yeah we can't just view diversity as gender alone so when  I am in a decision-making context I really try and influence that culture and that is  not something I had initially but I've built that muscle over yeah years of being on boards  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:17:24):**  and in those kind of spaces.  Do you have any examples of you've mentioned standing up in ag and asking questions or  tough conversations like any times where your values or the impact you want to have come  into conflict with the organization that you're working with or there's been limits or challenges  with upholding those values or realizing that change?  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:17:46):**  Part of the reason I was drawn to White Oak and Agriculture as a company was that they  were doing and we are doing things differently and I think it's a list we are a listed company  and we're a regenerative food and farming company so we are in a lot of different ways  different to the status quo and what I love about our DNA is that we're up for having  bold conversations about how we could do things differently and so how that plays out for  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:18:12):**  me is that often in the spaces I'm in representing White Oak and Agriculture is that I guess  Regen Ag has been politicized a lot in the past but I welcome those kinds of conversations  because cool Regen Ag might not be the answer but for me personally it's where I see a next  great step for food production for ag for a way in which we relate to natural resources  a way in which we relate to country to valuing different things back to my point before around  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:18:42):**  it's not just the economy it's actually taking into account the social fabric and the environmental  impact that we're having and I've been presenting at conferences here in Western Australia in  front of growers about wide open ag and yeah hairy questions come at me it excites me I  don't have the answers I don't have all the answers that wide open ag is doing now is  unprecedented and yeah we're a listed company that is attracting different streams of investment  
**[0:19:12-0:19:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:19:12):**  into ag we are you know creating the world's first regenerative oat milk here in West Australia  using WA regeneratively grown oats we're hoping to unlock the power of Australian sweet wheat  weapons as a protein source that can be used in a whole range of different things from  an additive as a protein right down to making cheese for goodness sakes or whatever we decide  describe cheese as and right down to that conversation about what's cheese is it can  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:19:39):**  you make cheese out of loop and protein who knows how about we have a conversation about  it this idea that agriculture is especially focused on the past and the way we've done  things in the past and the heritage and the history that we've come from and that's so  beautiful in so many ways like you've talked about both in Australia and in other countries  and yet other industries spend more time talking about the future and what innovations we can  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:20:00):**  drive and what things we can change and what challenges we can have and how we can call  things new things and make new things and do them with new materials and agriculture  resists that pretty strongly do you think that's a fair characterization and is that  view limiting the growth of agriculture I certainly think there are some parts of the  ag industry that are like that and I can even hear it in the way people introduce themselves  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:20:24):**  and it's interesting that my framing was I grew up in the WA wheat belt and that's how  I just define my existence as someone who works in ag which is actually really unhelpful  it should be I'm Liz I'm up for a really exciting sustainable future for ag and it shouldn't  matter that you're not a sixth generation beef farmer from Queensland but it's so interesting  that's how we frame it and I think what I've noticed and I think it's really easy to hang  
**[0:20:50-0:20:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:20:50):**  crap on government in big G sense but from a community development slash regional development  point of view it is so often that we forget to have people slash community centric or  driven anything and we see it with policy being made about the ag industry we see it  in initiatives that are rolled out within government and it's and that's not and it's  not just government it is business it is it's so often decisions are made without the due  
**[0:21:21-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:21:21):**  process and good consultation with community so I I also understand why people and me included  give the context because context is actually critical you know nothing about us without  us I think that is so critical when we're making decisions at any level when you think  about wide open ag it seems like there's this interesting opportunity to apply technologies  like what you're doing with lupins and some of the ways the business is thinking about  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:21:51):**  scaling but also maintain that environmental and social focus is that true what I see from  the outside and any color you can provide on how technology is being used and is there  a tension between region and technology or is that a false dichotomy I think it is a  bit to what I said before about that tension between how it is I say future of the ag industry  when we are creating that future keeping at the heart of us the values that we hold dear  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:22:17):**  so it is I think to a certain extent a false dichotomy because we can't go backwards like  we've got to we we we know better so how about we do better and if doing better is to utilize  a technology to allow us to be more efficient more sustainable yes perhaps reduce the number  of people for example per hectare on a particular property so when we make decisions about that  what does that look like what's the impact of that and how is it that we can ensure that  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:22:42):**  the social fabric is still continues to be part of that DNA headcount or not it gets  really scary to me for especially Western Australia because when I think about bringing  in technology scale of farming sustainability of farming for environmental reasons it gets  tough to not see a tension with social fabric and like where do kids go to school and who  lives in this town when you're gonna fly from Perth out to wherever and that's true in other  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:23:07):**  countries too it seems like a really tough trade-off to break what solutions do you see  or what paths forward because again I see too much narrative that's let's just keep  the way it is or go back to the way it was or vibrant regional communities and it's okay  but how do we do this in a way that is actually viable for environmental goals and economic  goals that yeah maybe we just have to change the whole system and break this focus on growth  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:23:29):**  I don't know what would your answer be I think to continue to follow what we've always done  is a really dangerous thing because we fall into this falseness of this is the only way  it can be and I guess I'm nervous to say that I don't have any have an answer but I think  what we honestly probably don't but I do know that we need a transformation we can't just  keep adapting and adapting is just operating in the same thinking the same with the same  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:23:57):**  resources and not doing anything fundamentally differently but transforming is going okay  let's think more systemically let's think bigger picture what's important to us because  there's a trade-off that we're not being conscious to here so in the context of for example education  I think we could do education differently how else could we imagine what education looks  like we could be creating really great flourishing education facilities and systems in the regions  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:24:26):**  there's nothing saying that we couldn't and because when you start losing those key infrastructures  in communities your point Sarah like that's when community really starts to dwindle and  like anything is possible we've actually just got to reimagine and transform the way that  we've done things what probably what I've learned is that you don't have to have the  answers but you've got to be asking good questions what are hard conversations in agriculture  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:24:51):**  that we're not having enough of one that I'll I think you mentioned climate before and I  don't know if there's anything that comes to mind around climate that would be pretty  top of mind for me so I think I remember hmm maybe about five years ago so I've been involved  with farmers for climate action for a little while now and I remember putting an article  into the one of the ag industry newspapers and lots of letters to the editors saying  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:25:16):**  climate change is hooey and doesn't exist and rah rah rah and I think if I was to do  the same again now I don't know if I would get any letters to the editor necessarily  I think that we have come a long way what I'm worried about is that we're not being  as proactive as we need to be as an industry alone as a society I don't think we are taking  it seriously enough I also feel like there's a real just not knowing what to do people  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:25:46):**  analysis paralysis yes like it is funny how where do you start and so I think that there's  a real not an apathy but a real tension of like far out there's this massive thing on  horizon and especially for farmers so I think there's a real yeah paralysis to communities  going how do I even do a thing we especially like in the short term so I think that's a  conversation that we're not having but I also am just really mindful that people especially  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:26:16):**  people on the land it's lived and people are living these impacts now and it's freaking  hard so my commitment is to ensure that these and a big part of my work is to ensure that  these individuals in these communities are resilient and have enough in their tank to  be able to one respond to these climatic emergencies but also go right how do we set ourselves  up for the future that we're not going to be hit as dramatically as we have been in  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:26:43):**  the past I think it's an interesting opportunity for ag and for Australia in particular because  like I've had so many calls in the last weeks and months of people going what the heck is  happening down there you got fires you got floods you got droughts like what is going  on and for farmers especially to take a leadership role in saying this is real here's what we're  doing about it here's what you can do to obviously our government aside I think it's a opportunity  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:27:07):**  for farmers to play a leadership role and hopefully yeah people like you will help to  make that happen and that's the beauty so two and a bit years ago we had a strategy  session for one open ag and we're like so how is it that we can unlock or overcome barriers  that regenerative farmers are having and that's how we've done what we've done in terms of  online food platform pro-tenant oatmeal kind of looking at our comparative advantage here  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:27:31):**  in West Australia what we could do as a company but then also there was this interesting piece  of like we've got all these conscious consumers as we call them like that are really interested  in doing stuff too how do we how do we connect those with the regenerative farmers which  is why we're our online platform came out it was like a really easy win because there  are people that are just that are not on the land that are very concerned about what is  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:27:56):**  happening on the land and that are committed to having a more sustainable future as well  so it was actually about us connecting them and creating opportunity for both and I think  it's going to take everyone to be able to solve these wicked problems so the more that  we can create connection the better I love that example too of technology enabling scale  and breaking some of those trade-offs you've mentioned diverse perspectives and getting  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:28:18):**  different voices in the room and empowering them with confidence what are or who are some  of the voices that we don't have enough of in the room in agriculture I've often been  the first woman or the young person and they're really great first steps for a decision-making  group to have especially if we've got some pretty similar thinking shall we say around  the table who I see that we're missing at the table and I think it's probably been my  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:28:42):**  through my exposure in the horticulture industry we have a lot of new Australians that work  in the horticulture industry that have some very diverse perspectives lived experiences  do things very differently and a bit to my point before about PNG not better or worse  different and there's some great brains that we can have around decision-making tables  on how it is that we can make the ag industry more sustainable more inclusive and the other  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:29:08):**  opportunity or the other group of people that I see that we absolutely need to have at the  decision-making table especially when it comes to land management First Nations Australians  we need to have Aboriginal people at the table especially in relation to making a decision  about country and about land but also their area not even generations we all know these  thousands of years of knowledge that we have overlooked for quite some time now and there  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:29:33):**  are lessons to be learned from the past to help create that future that aligns with what  it is that we see as an ag industry that's important to us and at the heart of our values  but also as a country.  From my perspective our conversation with Liz today captured some really valuable lessons  I appreciated her point that however much PNG farmers have to learn from Australians  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:29:54):**  they have just as much to teach in particular about valuing and prioritizing the social  fabric of communities and the environmental integrity of the land.  Next Liz's description of being strategic in the boardroom is critical the idea of planting  seeds resonates with our work in other words it's usually not possible to introduce an  idea and then immediately ask people to act on it it often takes days weeks or even years  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:30:18):**  for an idea or a change to take root and as Liz says to emerge.  Finally Liz's idea of nothing about us without us is incredibly powerful not only in the  context of government or policy but for businesses as well and more broadly for anyone working  and hoping to make an impact in the food and ag space the community of people that's meant  to be impacted should be the first to be consulted and their feedback should be the most important  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/21/wide-open-agriculture-liz-brennan-women-australian-agriculture#t=0:30:43):**  driver of progress whether you're a volunteer working with the local government or a company  aiming to build a technology that makes your customers life better.

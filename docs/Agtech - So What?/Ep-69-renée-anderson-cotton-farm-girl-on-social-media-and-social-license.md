### Agtech - So What?  (2020-57-17)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome back to the Ag Tech So What podcast brought to you by Agthentic.  I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. Today's guest is Renee Anderson. Renee is a farmer from  Emerald in Queensland. She's also overall just a champion for the cotton industry and  best management practices. Renee has spent 23 years working in cotton as a researcher,  an agronomist, an off-field scholar, and a farmer. And she has lots to share about social  
**[0:00:31-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:00:31):**  license and the role that technology can play in changing the narrative and improving production.  We start with Renee with a few birds in the background telling us about her farm. On the  home property here, it's 550 acres under irrigation and the other farm's got 650 acres under irrigation.  And it's a mixture of different crops, including cotton, popcorn, chickpeas, mung beans, and  currently have wheat and chickpeas planted just a couple of weeks ago. So it's looking  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:01:02):**  quite good. We did start obviously this last season on really low allocation. We're still  in drought up here. Had a little bit of carryover and there was a little bit of rain in around  picking time, which is usually what happens. As listeners I'm sure know, Australia has  been in a horrible drought, but the impact and duration of the drought has been different  depending on the region and the farm. I'm probably a little bit different to most of  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:01:30):**  New South Wales. We've got a really large dam here in the central Highlands that feeds  the irrigation farms and it's 98% reliable for water. So in the average year, we really  do quite well in terms of being able to access water allocation most years. It has been really  tough because there hasn't been a lot of inflows and this last year was the lowest level since  the dam was built in the sort of late sixties. So it was a very unusual kind of year. We  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:02:01):**  are going into the fourth or fifth year of drought, however, and most of the country  sort of along the Queensland central and Western areas are extended. The Darling Downs still  haven't had decent rainfall for five years. So it's really tough for those guys.  For Renee, that's meant they haven't been able to get in as much crop as normal.  So we've currently got 50% of the area planted into winter crop and we had 16% of our summer  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:02:30):**  crop planted. Yeah. So it was definitely down and that's sort of been the last few years.  It's been around between 15 to 25% of the area for the last four years.  Do you think that as a result of this, I know it's not, you know, there's been droughts  for a long time and producers are used to in some ways managing for this kind of thing,  but are there any things that are shifting that you think will be longer term changes,  
**[0:02:55-0:02:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:02:55):**  whether that's practices or technology or anything like that?  Yeah, definitely. So here in the central Highlands, we've come off the back of a four year research  project with the Department of Ag with NCSIRO. We did an early season trial looking at the  most optimal place to plant cotton here in the central Highlands based on weather events  and to try and maximise yield and also miss monsoonal weather and really hot dry conditions  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:03:21):**  sort of peak flowering. And we've actually moved the planting window from what used to  be September, October forward to August and it's worked really well. So growers have seen  quite a bit of success with that. And also the planting window with the three gene technology  cotton, the Bulgard 3 has allowed a lot more flexibility in the system so we can plant  between the 1st of August right up to the end of December now. And it just means it's  
**[0:03:47-0:03:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:03:47):**  minimising the risk of exposure to adverse weather events. It gives us a lot more opportunity.  We used to have a six week planting window and guaranteed the day you get the pickers  out of the shed, we'd have some fairly significant rainfall events here with the monsoonal influences.  Yeah, I was showing a friend of mine a picture of a cotton field the other day and was like  but what you don't know is like it can be quite wet and moist and I've got friends and  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:04:15):**  boots and snakes and like you look at the beautiful white cotton and you just don't  at all get a sense of what might be happening in and around.  Yeah and it really only looks white and fluffy for like a 10 day period so the rest of the  time it's the same family as hibiscus so if you were to drive past it, it just looked  like a lush green paddock with pink and white flowers through it.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:04:35):**  One of the reasons I wanted to speak with Renee is that the cotton industry in Australia  has a reputation for both being really strong adopters of technology and also being under  significant pressure or threat as some might say with social license issues. And I wanted  to understand how these two things go together and how technology can maybe help.  The cotton industry has been innovative for as long as I can remember so I've been involved  
**[0:05:03-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:05:03):**  for 23 years. I'm feeling quite old now but and I guess when I started conventional cotton  was still very much everyone was still growing it and I was working on the InGard single  gene trials with the Department of Agriculture and Entomology at the time and pesticides  became a huge issue and basically in terms of a social license aspect if something didn't  change then the risk was that we would lose the right to grow cotton here in Australia.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:05:34):**  So it was very timely with the introduction of the GM technology and it over these last  two decades has just changed significantly like a massive reduction in insecticide use  98% and herbicide overall toxicity is really reduced as well. And I think with best management  practices we were one of the first industries to introduce the best management program into  the cotton industry and then other industries have slowly sort of picked that up. And I  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:06:04):**  think the other thing is quite often it's a profitable crop and it's very hard to be  sustainable if you're not making money on your farm and it's very hard to introduce  innovative practices if you don't have the spare cash.  Take me back to that kind of early on with some of the social license issues what did  it kind of feel like? What were the pressures? What did it feel like for growers at the time  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:06:28):**  that this was such a big risk?  It was a massive risk at the time so the insecticide was almost weekly or you know every two weeks  it would need spraying so the community was really quite frightened because they'd see  the ag planes flying around the sky quite a bit and obviously we're very close to town  here so I'm only 5 k's from town and it just puts a lot of pressure on communities who  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:06:52):**  quite often are not sure what's going out of the aeroplane and there was definitely  the risk when there was a spray drift incident onto a grass paddock and cattle fed and there  were some residues that were picked up in the cattle industry so it almost shut down  two industries at once. So it was just really it was like a compounding sort of pressure  from communities. There was a couple of in our region we had what was called a leukemia  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:07:26):**  cluster and they it wasn't from the aerial spraying as they were all quite new people  to town within a 12 month period but it sort of circulated and generated a lot of discussion  and even now 20 years later 23 years later that still talked about the cotton industry.  Renee mentioned Best Management Practices or BMP as a program that drove adoption of  new technologies and practices so why or how was this so successful? The Best Management  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:07:58):**  Practice program in the Australian cotton industry doesn't just cover one module it's  sort of quite a it's a really large program that encompasses lots of different aspects  across the farm. One that I find is really important is the workplace health and safety  and HR so looking after your staff is really really important. It's hard to get staff on  farm so if you're following things to make sure that they're happy their health and well-being  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:08:22):**  is looked after you know they're being paid really well and they feel like that they have  ownership over some of the practices on farm then it helps to connect them to what their  daily life is you know they can't they come onto the farm they need to know that they're  going to be safe and looked after while they're here as well because they're a farmer as well  so and I think it's important that they come along with the program. Do you have any stories  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:08:48):**  of that or any examples like whether that's for your farm or farmers you've worked with  of kind of how that's how that's worked? Yeah sure so one thing that I do during picking  every morning and I generally hire backpackers we're still old school here with the basket  picker the area is not really big enough to afford one of the big round bell pickers yet  and so we have a group morning tea session every morning with all the backpackers we  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:09:11):**  sit around we go we have a chat about what worked well the day before what didn't work  well what areas need to be looked at for maintenance and was there any sort of close calls or risks  that we need to address and it I just found it brought them all together we could have  a bit of a yarn over a cup of tea coffee and some cake and they felt like they were part  of the process too and I think that's yeah it's really important that you sort of just  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:09:37):**  sit back and look at how things are going because it's quite a stressful time to during  cotton picking everyone gets really quite tired it's very hot here in in the central  highlands during January and people can get hot tired and grumpy so having that morning  to sort of reflect on what you did and how the day went and how can we improve for the  next days. Because Renee has seen this work so well across the industry she's brought  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:10:03):**  it to her farm as well and for our non-australian listeners out there a smoke oh is a smoke  break it took me a while to learn that one. We try and do like a smoke oh each morning  I've only got one full-time employee here on the farm so it's not a huge smoker but  we sit back and just sort of reflect on is there any area that's high risk on the farm  too because quite often when you're seeing it every day you don't really take note of  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:10:29):**  you know what could potentially be considered a high risk for someone else and so you know  looking out the window while you're doing irrigation and counting rows and all of a  sudden you're over a little check and you know the car's balanced on a you know a pipe  you know just things that we can do to sort of highlight those areas of high risk. These  might not seem like big changes or revolutionary insights but really it's these simple easy  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:10:55):**  to implement solutions that Renee says can make a big difference and the best ideas usually  come from the team. Yeah I think the more practical and low cost that you can keep solutions  for farmers the more likely they are to implement. I think quite often the biggest barrier is  this is going to be really hard or this is going to be really expensive and looking at  ways that they can do like an emergency shower with some poly pipe that they all have lying  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:11:23):**  around in their shed and an old shower out of the donger and something that you know  just works really quickly if put together to solve that particular problem and I think  we're always looking for photos of things that you know meet the requirements that are  going to save a lot of money and the farmers a lot of time. They don't have to go to town  and buy a really expensive emergency shower. Yeah do you have any other examples like that?  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:11:52):**  I love the kind of farm hacks you know anything else that comes to mind? Yeah so the IBC challenges  I just absolutely love them on Twitter and there's a lot of guys that will cut them down  and use them as funding within a storage if they've got an old you know everyone has an  old shipping container on the farm and a lot of them used to have the timber slats in the  bottom and it's like how do we make this work for a chemical storage shed that's going to  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:12:19):**  be you know practical so being able to put 20 litre drums inside an IBC so that they're  not having to re-line the floor is a really quick and easy solution. There's so many different  solutions out there to make things work. You mentioned social media do you see a lot of  these tips and practices being shared on social media? Yeah I love when farmers share their  farming stories and they're always really quite ingenious people and it's I always share  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:12:52):**  something that I go oh that's a really cool tip that someone else could use and it's a  really quite a different group of people than some of the other social media like Facebook  quite often it can get quite negative space against Ag really really quickly because I  think a lot of people can put their opinion out there with lots of words and it can go  downhill really quickly I find Twitter is generally quite positive you know there's  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:13:17):**  lots of beautiful farm photos or oops look what's happened here how can I solve this  problem and farmers are really quite quick to jump in and sort of have a have a bit of  a say and offer some advice and I find it's generally taken really quite well. My whole  Twitter feed is just Ag Twitter which I love and most of it I can't contribute to because  it's like how do I fix this piece of broken equipment I'm like definitely not my area  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:13:39):**  of expertise but I'm really excited to see all the solutions that come along. Yeah a  few weeks ago I just kept seeing everyone getting bogged I'm like how are they getting  bogged and I had to apologize because I just couldn't understand why I was seeing so many  because I can't even get near the fields if we've had a couple of millimeters of rain  in this black soil I can't even get past the sheds I'm like what are they doing in that  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:14:03):**  field but when it's that wet but you know if they've got springs which dry land farms  quite different to an irrigated where laser leveled you know there's no accidental springs  popping out but they can be driving along and all of a sudden hit a random spring that  you just don't know is there and yeah they share that story and it just it's you're learning  something from a different perspective and you have to remember not to be so judgmental  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:14:28):**  because I was I really was I'm like what are they doing down in the wet field and all I  can think of is this soil scientists drowsing on them what are you doing in that really  wet field. Renee had the chance to really ramp up her social media presence when she  was selected for a Nuffield scholarship and traveled around the world learning about how  management practices and communications can drive community support for agriculture. So  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:14:54):**  my project's looking at what drives the adoption of best management practices on farm and how  does science communication and best practice influence our social social license on farm.  What are some of your favorite stories or examples like what are anything that surprised  you that you I'm sure there's lots but anything that comes to mind that was really different  than you expected it would be? Probably the most surprising thing that I saw was the wild  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:15:20):**  blueberries oversea yeah in Nova Scotia I think it was they kept talking about these  rambling vegetative stage because they're a two-year cycle so I was pitching picturing  these huge shrubs and we're sort of driving up through the mountains and they're just  tiny like they're literally this big and you walk through and then they don't even come  up to your ankle so that was really quite funny. One of the most interesting things  
**[0:15:47-0:15:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:15:47):**  that I saw was in California was a rice farmer it was just a really impressive setup and  similar to cotton rice can cop a bit of a hiding in terms of perceptions and this farmer  sat down with his whole entire crew and they said Tommy what are the biggest risks to our  farming to our farming business I want the 30 worst things that you could possibly think  of to happen and they every single person so whether it was you know the person who  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:16:17):**  swept up the sheds everyone had to write a list of things that they thought they could  tackle and they picked the top five and they worked with the state government the natural  resource management group the fisheries department California trout and they came up with a plan  to time post-harvest the retting of the the breakdown of the fields to set up the rice  patties to time with the migratory birds they introduced plankton into the fields as well  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:16:46):**  so the birds had feed in those rice patties and then they were releasing that nutrients  and setting up fish homes within the the waterways so that they were reintroducing the salmon  species into the riverways it was just really impressive how how much thought went into  the whole process and you know how they could see where they needed to go in the future  with you know irrigation delivery had changed the whole life cycle of the fish and it was  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:17:16):**  a really important thing for them to focus on reintroducing the fish species the native  salmon back into their waterways creating homes and hmm.  Whether for innovative new systems social license farm safety or ag tech this idea of  getting staff buy-in and the whole team coming up with ideas for changes and improvements  is something Renee has seen work again and again.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:17:41):**  And I really noticed that with the BMP program in the cotton industry it started with growers  who wanted to fix some issues and then instead of government stepping in because potentially  the risk was government would step in put a whole heap of legislation in place and a  lot of red tape to manage what we were doing and for everyone to get together and then  write up a program on how we were going to self manage and then see such a success with  
**[0:18:08-0:18:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:18:08):**  the program and I see that in a lot of different ag industries you know if if it has been brought  in without that grassroots intervention and discussion quite often it's not it doesn't  have that practical feel to it all at all.  Another theme for Renee was the importance of good communications but this can be easier  said than done.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:18:29):**  So for me I'm not a public speaker at all it actually it terrifies me but I I guess  I watched and learned over the last few years some really good science communicators and  I thought well how can we as as an industry and as farmers because I thought it's really  important for farmers to get their voices out there because I felt like there was other  people telling my story that didn't connect with what I was doing on the farm about cotton  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:18:59):**  and they were telling me I was using all this water and using all this pesticide I'm like  what are you talking about and I just felt well I need to have a say in what I'm doing  as well and I just thought you know who's doing a really good job in this space and  what can we learn from other people and I found the ones that really connect online  with their audience are the ones they're so polite you know always very polite and kind  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:19:25):**  and even if they disagree they're not going to have a barney and there's no they're not  getting defensive they they'll disagree but in a really polite way and it also always  came with really great infographics with a snapshot shot of information as well because  people learn in different ways there's the visual and you know I'm not that great as  we were discussing the other day I have to take a lot of notes if I'm listening to something  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:19:53):**  and then I have to read it later to sort of for it to sink in so having that cross multi  media type experience for people so that they can learn and sort of see a snapshot really  quickly.  How do you think about like I can empathize with the the challenge of okay so you have  to farm and you have to farm you know you keep keep on top of the technology and stay  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:20:17):**  up with best practices and manage weather and uncertainty and run a business and now  you also have to get on social media and tell this story and do it in multiple media ways  and you may or may not get a premium and like that seems like a big pill to swallow what's  your I don't know kind of response to that?  Don't don't be on there all the time because it's really easy for an hour or three to disappear  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:20:42):**  so I really pick and choose the times and I quite often I'll only jump into a discussion  if I'm really passionate about it or if I feel like there's something that I can add  value or some information if it's not really anything that I'm across like I really don't  know very much about animal production I could probably drop a link in about you know emissions  or something like that but it's not something that I'm going to participate in if I don't  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:21:05):**  if I'm not across it and I really pick and choose the times where I know the people who  I could probably learn something will be online as well and just making sure that it's not  all of your day because it's very yeah very quick to lose lots of hours in the day.  And beyond just the time it takes putting yourself out there on social media can be  really hard especially when you're talking about tough issues like social license.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:21:32):**  A lot of my friends are like oh my goodness you're so brave I can't believe you could  say that and then be hammered and not take it personally but that has taken me a really  long time to not take things personally and I'm able to go oh well it doesn't matter I  don't know that yet that that is very hard to put yourself out there and have an opinion  or not even an opinion but just make a statement that other people disagree with and a lot  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:21:57):**  of people can be quite personal when they attack my DMs can be really quite awful from  people who really disagree with cotton being grown in Australia and you know I'm not even  connected to the Murray Darling Basin and I'm told I'm a water thief.  It's really tricky so sometimes I think you just have to take a step back if you're feeling  really really overwhelmed that's always my advice and quite often people will send me  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:22:25):**  a message and go can you respond to this I really want to say that so and I can do it  really quickly without thinking about it so yeah it doesn't take a lot of time for me  anymore it used to be an emotional like a really big emotional thing to respond whereas  now it's like yeah it's like a bit of a muscle I guess you kind of build it up and it gets  stronger and then you're better at doing it yeah that's right yeah and I really only focus  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:22:51):**  on two so I only I do have an account across all of them I have an Instagram account I  think that has six photos from ten years I just forget that I have it you know and I  sort of jump on LinkedIn a couple of times a year as well if there's something that I  think is really valuable to my work so generally Twitter and Facebook.  Was there anything you saw overseas that you said I definitely want to get one of those  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:23:15):**  or we've got to bring that to Australia or that would really apply here?  There was heaps of really amazing apps that did a really great job of connecting farm  practices with just like a photo doing this here's the seed here's this and and it was  just uploaded and it just recorded everything I found the the tech adoption overseas was  just unbelievable and I think it's to do with their connectivity everywhere I went they  
**[0:23:40-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:23:40):**  had amazing mobile networks and internet connectivity so in Indonesia the farmers have an online  marketplace and they sell and trade almost like Amazon their cattle or their corn and  they sort of put up whatever traits it is about that particular thing and then it goes  onto the marketplace and it's a really transparent transaction and it was just so quick and easy  I'm like wow that's amazing and you know in the US in the middle of nowhere they just  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:24:11):**  have apps to turn on their irrigation you know here I'm sort of like trying to ring  someone and go can you hear me?  Yeah just I think the connectivity in most of the world sort of has really driven that  high level of tech.  When you kind of reflect on what you saw overseas and your work in the cotton industry what  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:24:33):**  do you what's your kind of vision of hope for the future of I guess Australian cotton  in the next I don't know five or ten years what are you really excited about?  I definitely think the tech the ag tech will just continue to drive what we do and the  efficiencies are continuously improving whether it's through plant breeding or just recognising  through sensors when exactly a plant needs water and for how long and you know it's switching  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:25:03):**  off automatically I just see that sort of technology just going ahead in leaps and bounds  and there's lots of different companies working in that space because I think the larger the  more that we go into variable climate with the climate change you know we're going to  have really extreme weather events so we'll lots of water or no water and using the resources  that we have really efficiently is going to be really under the spotlight over the next  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:25:31):**  few years.  The other thing that Renee is really excited about is post farmgate technologies and what  all of us as consumers will hopefully be seeing and using from natural fibres in the future.  One of the things that I really love with the natural fibres is the technology driven  that like post farmgate the new technologies in farm to make the natural fibres more usable  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:25:57):**  and more wearable like I really love that side of it and also they're fabulous for biodegradable  there's no micro plastics going into the environment and they're reducing you know the impact with  the dyes and but they're doing some really cool treatments to make things people's lives  easier at the other end so that you can wear a shirt and you know it's not as smelly by  the end of the day or you know that it's easier to iron in the morning if you've got to go  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:26:22):**  to work in a business suit and things like that.  So I'm really passionate about that side of the industry as well and I think it'll be  great to see new efficiencies and technologies driven in that side of the post production.  Totally yeah I think we're seeing that a bit with wool and the kind of performance wool  and you know whether it's for active wear or you know that kind of performance industry  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:26:45):**  and I think we'll see more of it in cotton as kind of natural fibres and yeah proving  the functionality but environmental benefits as well.  Yeah I got to spend the day at Cotton Ink in North Carolina and it like the amount of  research that goes into the usability of the fibres and they test every sort of fibre and  it was just amazing walking down the hallways and sort of feeling how they will treat a  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:27:10):**  fibre to make it have much more functionality.  It was it's just really fascinating.  Maybe last question for you in having thought so much about best management practices and  kind of adoption what if any advice would you have for technology developers like anyone  building technology in terms of how they could think about making sure it's useful for farmers  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:27:34):**  or does get it up?  Yeah the most important thing is talking to farmers because developing a piece of tech  that you think is a great idea doesn't necessarily mean it's going to connect and work well on  the farm so having those two people in a room brainstorming is so important.  Practicality and functionality too you know in areas of low connectivity it's really got  
**[0:27:59-0:28:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:27:59):**  to do a great task and I think being able to utilise tech that makes our lives a lot  easier because I find even though the tech improves I feel like things get busier and  busier each year even though you know the gears a little bit bigger now so we're less  time in the tractor because we're driving stuff that's bigger so stuff just to yeah  make things run a lot smoother yeah smooth out some of those.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:28:30):**  Definitely it's funny actually like the I think there's more recognition that talking  to farmers and talking to customers and kind of doing that collaborative development so  important and yet it's still really hard to do like I think a lot of the same maybe vocal  farmers that are out there on Twitter and kind of talking about innovation get their  shoulder tapped all the time versus there's others who don't and for you know you don't  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:28:55):**  want to only talk to the same 20 farmers that are the loudest ones because they're not maybe  farming the same way as some of the others in the space who aren't as loud but they're  the ones that get the phone call.  Yeah yep and I find it's the quiet ones that usually have engineered something really amazing  on the farm that works just beautifully for a problem that they have been trying to solve  
**[0:29:15-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:29:15):**  for ages so I guess connecting with grower groups and individuals and having a chat around  a barbecue is usually the best way.  Love it more of that kind of social connection as well I mean it's actually been a theme  kind of various things you've said that it ends up being more about the people like whether  it's the people on your team that are recommending changes or the people overseas that you're  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:29:37):**  connecting with or on the other side of a Twitter post or on the other side of the technology  like that's kind of what it comes down to.  Yeah that was the probably the biggest learning that I had during my Nuffield journey and  it was from one of the Kiwi fellows Hamish who we travelled with I was in a group of  10 and it really is everything that we do is about the people.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:01):**  We met the most amazing people and you know sometimes there's situations where like really  tiny little farm but you connect with these people and you just listen to their story  it always comes back to the people so even in a tech driven world there's someone behind  that making it and developing it and they need those connections so that it works really  well.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:26):**  Where if people want to learn more about what you're up to or what you think about cotton  and social license and all of these issues where can they find more about you and from  you?  Yeah so I am Farmer Renee on Twitter and I do have a Nuffield scholarship page on Facebook  as well and it's just Renee Anderson Nuffield scholar.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:45):**  Cool I will link both of those in the show notes but thank you so much for agreeing to  have a chat.  No worries thank you.  Hey guys Sarah here again with some final comments.  This conversation with Renee and some of the follow-ups that we had after really got me  
**[0:31:08-0:31:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:31:08):**  thinking.  Renee and I were talking about science communicators in agriculture so that I could link Renee's  favorites to the show notes and she told me that her favorite science communicator just  quit social media because of racism.  Now in this episode Renee and I talked about how social media and especially Ag Twitter  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:31:29):**  is largely a positive place where people can share inventions and tips but that's not always  the case.  The incident Renee was referring to was some pretty horrific racist comments from some  farmers and then various researchers, science communicators and other farmers calling them  out and shaming them and then all of the normal angry yelling and personal insults that you  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:31:54):**  would expect would come next.  And I guess all this got me thinking about our role as a podcast, as a company and as  people in the Ag industry and talking about the Ag industry in today's world amidst the  protests and the social unrest.  And you know this is still a work in progress but where I've landed at least for today and  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:32:17):**  what I wanted to share with you guys is that I love working in agriculture but Ag definitely  does have some social license issues.  Now some are environmental and these get talked about a lot but some are also around acceptance  of outsiders and even in the worst cases racism and this is not okay and we do have to call  it out and we do have to do better.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:32:42):**  Talking about this stuff isn't easy and yet I know talking alone isn't good enough but  hopefully starting to bring these issues to the forefront can raise awareness, can catalyze  action and ultimately can lead to change.  So I've included some links in the show notes to keep this conversation going.  There are other people in Ag who are talking about these issues and other people who are  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:33:04):**  taking action.  If you have ideas, other links or perspectives to share I'd love to hear them.  Thanks guys as always for listening and until next time be safe.

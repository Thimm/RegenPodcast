### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:57:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome back to the Ag Tech So What podcast brought to you by Agthentic.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:00:07):**  I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. Today's guest is Renee Anderson. Renee is a farmer from  
**[0:00:13-0:00:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:00:13):**  Emerald in Queensland. She's also overall just a champion for the cotton industry and  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:00:20):**  best management practices. Renee has spent 23 years working in cotton as a researcher,  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:00:26):**  an agronomist, an off-field scholar, and a farmer. And she has lots to share about social  
**[0:00:31-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:00:31):**  license and the role that technology can play in changing the narrative and improving production.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:00:38):**  We start with Renee with a few birds in the background telling us about her farm. On the  
**[0:00:43-0:00:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:00:43):**  home property here, it's 550 acres under irrigation and the other farm's got 650 acres under irrigation.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:00:51):**  And it's a mixture of different crops, including cotton, popcorn, chickpeas, mung beans, and  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:00:57):**  currently have wheat and chickpeas planted just a couple of weeks ago. So it's looking  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:01:02):**  quite good. We did start obviously this last season on really low allocation. We're still  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:01:07):**  in drought up here. Had a little bit of carryover and there was a little bit of rain in around  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:01:13):**  picking time, which is usually what happens. As listeners I'm sure know, Australia has  
**[0:01:18-0:01:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:01:18):**  been in a horrible drought, but the impact and duration of the drought has been different  
**[0:01:24-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:01:24):**  depending on the region and the farm. I'm probably a little bit different to most of  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:01:30):**  New South Wales. We've got a really large dam here in the central Highlands that feeds  
**[0:01:36-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:01:36):**  the irrigation farms and it's 98% reliable for water. So in the average year, we really  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:01:43):**  do quite well in terms of being able to access water allocation most years. It has been really  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:01:49):**  tough because there hasn't been a lot of inflows and this last year was the lowest level since  
**[0:01:54-0:02:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:01:54):**  the dam was built in the sort of late sixties. So it was a very unusual kind of year. We  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:02:01):**  are going into the fourth or fifth year of drought, however, and most of the country  
**[0:02:06-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:02:06):**  sort of along the Queensland central and Western areas are extended. The Darling Downs still  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:02:13):**  haven't had decent rainfall for five years. So it's really tough for those guys.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:02:17):**  For Renee, that's meant they haven't been able to get in as much crop as normal.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:02:22):**  So we've currently got 50% of the area planted into winter crop and we had 16% of our summer  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:02:30):**  crop planted. Yeah. So it was definitely down and that's sort of been the last few years.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:02:36):**  It's been around between 15 to 25% of the area for the last four years.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:02:42):**  Do you think that as a result of this, I know it's not, you know, there's been droughts  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:02:46):**  for a long time and producers are used to in some ways managing for this kind of thing,  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:02:50):**  but are there any things that are shifting that you think will be longer term changes,  
**[0:02:55-0:02:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:02:55):**  whether that's practices or technology or anything like that?  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:02:58):**  Yeah, definitely. So here in the central Highlands, we've come off the back of a four year research  
**[0:03:03-0:03:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:03:03):**  project with the Department of Ag with NCSIRO. We did an early season trial looking at the  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:03:11):**  most optimal place to plant cotton here in the central Highlands based on weather events  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:03:16):**  and to try and maximise yield and also miss monsoonal weather and really hot dry conditions  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:03:21):**  sort of peak flowering. And we've actually moved the planting window from what used to  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:03:25):**  be September, October forward to August and it's worked really well. So growers have seen  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:03:31):**  quite a bit of success with that. And also the planting window with the three gene technology  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:03:37):**  cotton, the Bulgard 3 has allowed a lot more flexibility in the system so we can plant  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:03:42):**  between the 1st of August right up to the end of December now. And it just means it's  
**[0:03:47-0:03:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:03:47):**  minimising the risk of exposure to adverse weather events. It gives us a lot more opportunity.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:03:55):**  We used to have a six week planting window and guaranteed the day you get the pickers  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:03:59):**  out of the shed, we'd have some fairly significant rainfall events here with the monsoonal influences.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:04:05):**  Yeah, I was showing a friend of mine a picture of a cotton field the other day and was like  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:04:11):**  but what you don't know is like it can be quite wet and moist and I've got friends and  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:04:15):**  boots and snakes and like you look at the beautiful white cotton and you just don't  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:04:18):**  at all get a sense of what might be happening in and around.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:04:22):**  Yeah and it really only looks white and fluffy for like a 10 day period so the rest of the  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:04:27):**  time it's the same family as hibiscus so if you were to drive past it, it just looked  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:04:31):**  like a lush green paddock with pink and white flowers through it.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:04:35):**  One of the reasons I wanted to speak with Renee is that the cotton industry in Australia  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:04:40):**  has a reputation for both being really strong adopters of technology and also being under  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:04:46):**  significant pressure or threat as some might say with social license issues. And I wanted  
**[0:04:52-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:04:52):**  to understand how these two things go together and how technology can maybe help.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:04:59):**  The cotton industry has been innovative for as long as I can remember so I've been involved  
**[0:05:03-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:05:03):**  for 23 years. I'm feeling quite old now but and I guess when I started conventional cotton  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:05:10):**  was still very much everyone was still growing it and I was working on the InGard single  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:05:15):**  gene trials with the Department of Agriculture and Entomology at the time and pesticides  
**[0:05:21-0:05:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:05:21):**  became a huge issue and basically in terms of a social license aspect if something didn't  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:05:28):**  change then the risk was that we would lose the right to grow cotton here in Australia.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:05:34):**  So it was very timely with the introduction of the GM technology and it over these last  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:05:39):**  two decades has just changed significantly like a massive reduction in insecticide use  
**[0:05:44-0:05:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:05:44):**  98% and herbicide overall toxicity is really reduced as well. And I think with best management  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:05:52):**  practices we were one of the first industries to introduce the best management program into  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:05:58):**  the cotton industry and then other industries have slowly sort of picked that up. And I  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:06:04):**  think the other thing is quite often it's a profitable crop and it's very hard to be  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:06:10):**  sustainable if you're not making money on your farm and it's very hard to introduce  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:06:14):**  innovative practices if you don't have the spare cash.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:06:20):**  Take me back to that kind of early on with some of the social license issues what did  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:06:24):**  it kind of feel like? What were the pressures? What did it feel like for growers at the time  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:06:28):**  that this was such a big risk?  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:06:31):**  It was a massive risk at the time so the insecticide was almost weekly or you know every two weeks  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:06:36):**  it would need spraying so the community was really quite frightened because they'd see  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:06:41):**  the ag planes flying around the sky quite a bit and obviously we're very close to town  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:06:46):**  here so I'm only 5 k's from town and it just puts a lot of pressure on communities who  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:06:52):**  quite often are not sure what's going out of the aeroplane and there was definitely  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:06:59):**  the risk when there was a spray drift incident onto a grass paddock and cattle fed and there  
**[0:07:06-0:07:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:07:06):**  were some residues that were picked up in the cattle industry so it almost shut down  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:07:14):**  two industries at once. So it was just really it was like a compounding sort of pressure  
**[0:07:19-0:07:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:07:19):**  from communities. There was a couple of in our region we had what was called a leukemia  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:07:26):**  cluster and they it wasn't from the aerial spraying as they were all quite new people  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:07:32):**  to town within a 12 month period but it sort of circulated and generated a lot of discussion  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:07:38):**  and even now 20 years later 23 years later that still talked about the cotton industry.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:07:44):**  Renee mentioned Best Management Practices or BMP as a program that drove adoption of  
**[0:07:50-0:07:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:07:50):**  new technologies and practices so why or how was this so successful? The Best Management  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:07:58):**  Practice program in the Australian cotton industry doesn't just cover one module it's  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:08:02):**  sort of quite a it's a really large program that encompasses lots of different aspects  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:08:07):**  across the farm. One that I find is really important is the workplace health and safety  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:08:11):**  and HR so looking after your staff is really really important. It's hard to get staff on  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:08:17):**  farm so if you're following things to make sure that they're happy their health and well-being  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:08:22):**  is looked after you know they're being paid really well and they feel like that they have  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:08:28):**  ownership over some of the practices on farm then it helps to connect them to what their  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:08:34):**  daily life is you know they can't they come onto the farm they need to know that they're  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:08:38):**  going to be safe and looked after while they're here as well because they're a farmer as well  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:08:43):**  so and I think it's important that they come along with the program. Do you have any stories  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:08:48):**  of that or any examples like whether that's for your farm or farmers you've worked with  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:08:52):**  of kind of how that's how that's worked? Yeah sure so one thing that I do during picking  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:08:57):**  every morning and I generally hire backpackers we're still old school here with the basket  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:09:01):**  picker the area is not really big enough to afford one of the big round bell pickers yet  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:09:07):**  and so we have a group morning tea session every morning with all the backpackers we  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:09:11):**  sit around we go we have a chat about what worked well the day before what didn't work  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:09:16):**  well what areas need to be looked at for maintenance and was there any sort of close calls or risks  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:09:22):**  that we need to address and it I just found it brought them all together we could have  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:09:26):**  a bit of a yarn over a cup of tea coffee and some cake and they felt like they were part  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:09:31):**  of the process too and I think that's yeah it's really important that you sort of just  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:09:37):**  sit back and look at how things are going because it's quite a stressful time to during  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:09:42):**  cotton picking everyone gets really quite tired it's very hot here in in the central  
**[0:09:46-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:09:46):**  highlands during January and people can get hot tired and grumpy so having that morning  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:09:53):**  to sort of reflect on what you did and how the day went and how can we improve for the  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:09:57):**  next days. Because Renee has seen this work so well across the industry she's brought  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:10:03):**  it to her farm as well and for our non-australian listeners out there a smoke oh is a smoke  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:10:09):**  break it took me a while to learn that one. We try and do like a smoke oh each morning  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:10:14):**  I've only got one full-time employee here on the farm so it's not a huge smoker but  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:10:18):**  we sit back and just sort of reflect on is there any area that's high risk on the farm  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:10:24):**  too because quite often when you're seeing it every day you don't really take note of  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:10:29):**  you know what could potentially be considered a high risk for someone else and so you know  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:10:35):**  looking out the window while you're doing irrigation and counting rows and all of a  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:10:38):**  sudden you're over a little check and you know the car's balanced on a you know a pipe  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:10:43):**  you know just things that we can do to sort of highlight those areas of high risk. These  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:10:49):**  might not seem like big changes or revolutionary insights but really it's these simple easy  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:10:55):**  to implement solutions that Renee says can make a big difference and the best ideas usually  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:11:01):**  come from the team. Yeah I think the more practical and low cost that you can keep solutions  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:11:07):**  for farmers the more likely they are to implement. I think quite often the biggest barrier is  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:11:13):**  this is going to be really hard or this is going to be really expensive and looking at  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:11:18):**  ways that they can do like an emergency shower with some poly pipe that they all have lying  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:11:23):**  around in their shed and an old shower out of the donger and something that you know  
**[0:11:28-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:11:28):**  just works really quickly if put together to solve that particular problem and I think  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:11:36):**  we're always looking for photos of things that you know meet the requirements that are  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:11:41):**  going to save a lot of money and the farmers a lot of time. They don't have to go to town  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:11:46):**  and buy a really expensive emergency shower. Yeah do you have any other examples like that?  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:11:52):**  I love the kind of farm hacks you know anything else that comes to mind? Yeah so the IBC challenges  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:11:58):**  I just absolutely love them on Twitter and there's a lot of guys that will cut them down  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:12:03):**  and use them as funding within a storage if they've got an old you know everyone has an  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:12:08):**  old shipping container on the farm and a lot of them used to have the timber slats in the  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:12:14):**  bottom and it's like how do we make this work for a chemical storage shed that's going to  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:12:19):**  be you know practical so being able to put 20 litre drums inside an IBC so that they're  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:12:26):**  not having to re-line the floor is a really quick and easy solution. There's so many different  
**[0:12:31-0:12:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:12:31):**  solutions out there to make things work. You mentioned social media do you see a lot of  
**[0:12:38-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:12:38):**  these tips and practices being shared on social media? Yeah I love when farmers share their  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:12:46):**  farming stories and they're always really quite ingenious people and it's I always share  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:12:52):**  something that I go oh that's a really cool tip that someone else could use and it's a  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:12:56):**  really quite a different group of people than some of the other social media like Facebook  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:13:02):**  quite often it can get quite negative space against Ag really really quickly because I  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:13:08):**  think a lot of people can put their opinion out there with lots of words and it can go  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:13:12):**  downhill really quickly I find Twitter is generally quite positive you know there's  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:13:17):**  lots of beautiful farm photos or oops look what's happened here how can I solve this  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:13:22):**  problem and farmers are really quite quick to jump in and sort of have a have a bit of  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:13:26):**  a say and offer some advice and I find it's generally taken really quite well. My whole  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:13:32):**  Twitter feed is just Ag Twitter which I love and most of it I can't contribute to because  
**[0:13:36-0:13:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:13:36):**  it's like how do I fix this piece of broken equipment I'm like definitely not my area  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:13:39):**  of expertise but I'm really excited to see all the solutions that come along. Yeah a  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:13:44):**  few weeks ago I just kept seeing everyone getting bogged I'm like how are they getting  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:13:48):**  bogged and I had to apologize because I just couldn't understand why I was seeing so many  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:13:54):**  because I can't even get near the fields if we've had a couple of millimeters of rain  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:13:59):**  in this black soil I can't even get past the sheds I'm like what are they doing in that  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:14:03):**  field but when it's that wet but you know if they've got springs which dry land farms  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:14:09):**  quite different to an irrigated where laser leveled you know there's no accidental springs  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:14:14):**  popping out but they can be driving along and all of a sudden hit a random spring that  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:14:18):**  you just don't know is there and yeah they share that story and it just it's you're learning  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:14:24):**  something from a different perspective and you have to remember not to be so judgmental  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:14:28):**  because I was I really was I'm like what are they doing down in the wet field and all I  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:14:33):**  can think of is this soil scientists drowsing on them what are you doing in that really  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:14:37):**  wet field. Renee had the chance to really ramp up her social media presence when she  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:14:42):**  was selected for a Nuffield scholarship and traveled around the world learning about how  
**[0:14:47-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:14:47):**  management practices and communications can drive community support for agriculture. So  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:14:54):**  my project's looking at what drives the adoption of best management practices on farm and how  
**[0:14:59-0:15:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:14:59):**  does science communication and best practice influence our social social license on farm.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:15:06):**  What are some of your favorite stories or examples like what are anything that surprised  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:15:09):**  you that you I'm sure there's lots but anything that comes to mind that was really different  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:15:14):**  than you expected it would be? Probably the most surprising thing that I saw was the wild  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:15:20):**  blueberries oversea yeah in Nova Scotia I think it was they kept talking about these  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:15:27):**  rambling vegetative stage because they're a two-year cycle so I was pitching picturing  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:15:32):**  these huge shrubs and we're sort of driving up through the mountains and they're just  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:15:37):**  tiny like they're literally this big and you walk through and then they don't even come  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:15:42):**  up to your ankle so that was really quite funny. One of the most interesting things  
**[0:15:47-0:15:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:15:47):**  that I saw was in California was a rice farmer it was just a really impressive setup and  
**[0:15:54-0:16:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:15:54):**  similar to cotton rice can cop a bit of a hiding in terms of perceptions and this farmer  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:16:00):**  sat down with his whole entire crew and they said Tommy what are the biggest risks to our  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:16:06):**  farming to our farming business I want the 30 worst things that you could possibly think  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:16:12):**  of to happen and they every single person so whether it was you know the person who  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:16:17):**  swept up the sheds everyone had to write a list of things that they thought they could  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:16:21):**  tackle and they picked the top five and they worked with the state government the natural  
**[0:16:27-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:16:27):**  resource management group the fisheries department California trout and they came up with a plan  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:16:34):**  to time post-harvest the retting of the the breakdown of the fields to set up the rice  
**[0:16:39-0:16:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:16:39):**  patties to time with the migratory birds they introduced plankton into the fields as well  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:16:46):**  so the birds had feed in those rice patties and then they were releasing that nutrients  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:16:52):**  and setting up fish homes within the the waterways so that they were reintroducing the salmon  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:16:58):**  species into the riverways it was just really impressive how how much thought went into  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:17:04):**  the whole process and you know how they could see where they needed to go in the future  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:17:10):**  with you know irrigation delivery had changed the whole life cycle of the fish and it was  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:17:16):**  a really important thing for them to focus on reintroducing the fish species the native  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:17:21):**  salmon back into their waterways creating homes and hmm.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:17:26):**  Whether for innovative new systems social license farm safety or ag tech this idea of  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:17:32):**  getting staff buy-in and the whole team coming up with ideas for changes and improvements  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:17:38):**  is something Renee has seen work again and again.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:17:41):**  And I really noticed that with the BMP program in the cotton industry it started with growers  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:17:46):**  who wanted to fix some issues and then instead of government stepping in because potentially  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:17:52):**  the risk was government would step in put a whole heap of legislation in place and a  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:17:56):**  lot of red tape to manage what we were doing and for everyone to get together and then  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:18:02):**  write up a program on how we were going to self manage and then see such a success with  
**[0:18:08-0:18:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:18:08):**  the program and I see that in a lot of different ag industries you know if if it has been brought  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:18:15):**  in without that grassroots intervention and discussion quite often it's not it doesn't  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:18:20):**  have that practical feel to it all at all.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:18:23):**  Another theme for Renee was the importance of good communications but this can be easier  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:18:28):**  said than done.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:18:29):**  So for me I'm not a public speaker at all it actually it terrifies me but I I guess  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:18:35):**  I watched and learned over the last few years some really good science communicators and  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:18:42):**  I thought well how can we as as an industry and as farmers because I thought it's really  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:18:48):**  important for farmers to get their voices out there because I felt like there was other  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:18:53):**  people telling my story that didn't connect with what I was doing on the farm about cotton  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:18:59):**  and they were telling me I was using all this water and using all this pesticide I'm like  
**[0:19:02-0:19:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:19:02):**  what are you talking about and I just felt well I need to have a say in what I'm doing  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:19:08):**  as well and I just thought you know who's doing a really good job in this space and  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:19:14):**  what can we learn from other people and I found the ones that really connect online  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:19:20):**  with their audience are the ones they're so polite you know always very polite and kind  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:19:25):**  and even if they disagree they're not going to have a barney and there's no they're not  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:19:31):**  getting defensive they they'll disagree but in a really polite way and it also always  
**[0:19:37-0:19:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:19:37):**  came with really great infographics with a snapshot shot of information as well because  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:19:44):**  people learn in different ways there's the visual and you know I'm not that great as  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:19:49):**  we were discussing the other day I have to take a lot of notes if I'm listening to something  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:19:53):**  and then I have to read it later to sort of for it to sink in so having that cross multi  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:19:59):**  media type experience for people so that they can learn and sort of see a snapshot really  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:20:05):**  quickly.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:20:07):**  How do you think about like I can empathize with the the challenge of okay so you have  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:20:13):**  to farm and you have to farm you know you keep keep on top of the technology and stay  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:20:17):**  up with best practices and manage weather and uncertainty and run a business and now  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:20:21):**  you also have to get on social media and tell this story and do it in multiple media ways  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:20:25):**  and you may or may not get a premium and like that seems like a big pill to swallow what's  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:20:31):**  your I don't know kind of response to that?  
**[0:20:35-0:20:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:20:35):**  Don't don't be on there all the time because it's really easy for an hour or three to disappear  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:20:42):**  so I really pick and choose the times and I quite often I'll only jump into a discussion  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:20:47):**  if I'm really passionate about it or if I feel like there's something that I can add  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:20:51):**  value or some information if it's not really anything that I'm across like I really don't  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:20:57):**  know very much about animal production I could probably drop a link in about you know emissions  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:21:01):**  or something like that but it's not something that I'm going to participate in if I don't  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:21:05):**  if I'm not across it and I really pick and choose the times where I know the people who  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:21:10):**  I could probably learn something will be online as well and just making sure that it's not  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:21:16):**  all of your day because it's very yeah very quick to lose lots of hours in the day.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:21:22):**  And beyond just the time it takes putting yourself out there on social media can be  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:21:27):**  really hard especially when you're talking about tough issues like social license.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:21:32):**  A lot of my friends are like oh my goodness you're so brave I can't believe you could  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:21:35):**  say that and then be hammered and not take it personally but that has taken me a really  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:21:41):**  long time to not take things personally and I'm able to go oh well it doesn't matter I  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:21:45):**  don't know that yet that that is very hard to put yourself out there and have an opinion  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:21:51):**  or not even an opinion but just make a statement that other people disagree with and a lot  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:21:57):**  of people can be quite personal when they attack my DMs can be really quite awful from  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:22:03):**  people who really disagree with cotton being grown in Australia and you know I'm not even  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:22:09):**  connected to the Murray Darling Basin and I'm told I'm a water thief.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:22:13):**  It's really tricky so sometimes I think you just have to take a step back if you're feeling  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:22:20):**  really really overwhelmed that's always my advice and quite often people will send me  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:22:25):**  a message and go can you respond to this I really want to say that so and I can do it  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:22:30):**  really quickly without thinking about it so yeah it doesn't take a lot of time for me  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:22:35):**  anymore it used to be an emotional like a really big emotional thing to respond whereas  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:22:41):**  now it's like yeah it's like a bit of a muscle I guess you kind of build it up and it gets  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:22:46):**  stronger and then you're better at doing it yeah that's right yeah and I really only focus  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:22:51):**  on two so I only I do have an account across all of them I have an Instagram account I  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:22:56):**  think that has six photos from ten years I just forget that I have it you know and I  
**[0:23:02-0:23:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:23:02):**  sort of jump on LinkedIn a couple of times a year as well if there's something that I  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:23:05):**  think is really valuable to my work so generally Twitter and Facebook.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:23:11):**  Was there anything you saw overseas that you said I definitely want to get one of those  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:23:15):**  or we've got to bring that to Australia or that would really apply here?  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:23:19):**  There was heaps of really amazing apps that did a really great job of connecting farm  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:23:24):**  practices with just like a photo doing this here's the seed here's this and and it was  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:23:29):**  just uploaded and it just recorded everything I found the the tech adoption overseas was  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:23:35):**  just unbelievable and I think it's to do with their connectivity everywhere I went they  
**[0:23:40-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:23:40):**  had amazing mobile networks and internet connectivity so in Indonesia the farmers have an online  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:23:49):**  marketplace and they sell and trade almost like Amazon their cattle or their corn and  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:23:54):**  they sort of put up whatever traits it is about that particular thing and then it goes  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:23:59):**  onto the marketplace and it's a really transparent transaction and it was just so quick and easy  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:24:05):**  I'm like wow that's amazing and you know in the US in the middle of nowhere they just  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:24:11):**  have apps to turn on their irrigation you know here I'm sort of like trying to ring  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:24:16):**  someone and go can you hear me?  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:24:19):**  Yeah just I think the connectivity in most of the world sort of has really driven that  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:24:24):**  high level of tech.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:24:27):**  When you kind of reflect on what you saw overseas and your work in the cotton industry what  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:24:33):**  do you what's your kind of vision of hope for the future of I guess Australian cotton  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:24:39):**  in the next I don't know five or ten years what are you really excited about?  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:24:44):**  I definitely think the tech the ag tech will just continue to drive what we do and the  
**[0:24:50-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:24:50):**  efficiencies are continuously improving whether it's through plant breeding or just recognising  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:24:57):**  through sensors when exactly a plant needs water and for how long and you know it's switching  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:25:03):**  off automatically I just see that sort of technology just going ahead in leaps and bounds  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:25:08):**  and there's lots of different companies working in that space because I think the larger the  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:25:14):**  more that we go into variable climate with the climate change you know we're going to  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:25:20):**  have really extreme weather events so we'll lots of water or no water and using the resources  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:25:26):**  that we have really efficiently is going to be really under the spotlight over the next  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:25:31):**  few years.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:25:33):**  The other thing that Renee is really excited about is post farmgate technologies and what  
**[0:25:37-0:25:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:25:37):**  all of us as consumers will hopefully be seeing and using from natural fibres in the future.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:25:44):**  One of the things that I really love with the natural fibres is the technology driven  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:25:51):**  that like post farmgate the new technologies in farm to make the natural fibres more usable  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:25:57):**  and more wearable like I really love that side of it and also they're fabulous for biodegradable  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:26:02):**  there's no micro plastics going into the environment and they're reducing you know the impact with  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:26:07):**  the dyes and but they're doing some really cool treatments to make things people's lives  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:26:13):**  easier at the other end so that you can wear a shirt and you know it's not as smelly by  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:26:18):**  the end of the day or you know that it's easier to iron in the morning if you've got to go  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:26:22):**  to work in a business suit and things like that.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:26:25):**  So I'm really passionate about that side of the industry as well and I think it'll be  
**[0:26:28-0:26:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:26:28):**  great to see new efficiencies and technologies driven in that side of the post production.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:26:35):**  Totally yeah I think we're seeing that a bit with wool and the kind of performance wool  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:26:39):**  and you know whether it's for active wear or you know that kind of performance industry  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:26:45):**  and I think we'll see more of it in cotton as kind of natural fibres and yeah proving  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:26:50):**  the functionality but environmental benefits as well.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:26:53):**  Yeah I got to spend the day at Cotton Ink in North Carolina and it like the amount of  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:26:59):**  research that goes into the usability of the fibres and they test every sort of fibre and  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:27:05):**  it was just amazing walking down the hallways and sort of feeling how they will treat a  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:27:10):**  fibre to make it have much more functionality.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:27:13):**  It was it's just really fascinating.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:27:17):**  Maybe last question for you in having thought so much about best management practices and  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:27:22):**  kind of adoption what if any advice would you have for technology developers like anyone  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:27:29):**  building technology in terms of how they could think about making sure it's useful for farmers  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:27:34):**  or does get it up?  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:27:36):**  Yeah the most important thing is talking to farmers because developing a piece of tech  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:27:41):**  that you think is a great idea doesn't necessarily mean it's going to connect and work well on  
**[0:27:45-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:27:45):**  the farm so having those two people in a room brainstorming is so important.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:27:54):**  Practicality and functionality too you know in areas of low connectivity it's really got  
**[0:27:59-0:28:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:27:59):**  to do a great task and I think being able to utilise tech that makes our lives a lot  
**[0:28:07-0:28:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:28:07):**  easier because I find even though the tech improves I feel like things get busier and  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:28:14):**  busier each year even though you know the gears a little bit bigger now so we're less  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:28:19):**  time in the tractor because we're driving stuff that's bigger so stuff just to yeah  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:28:25):**  make things run a lot smoother yeah smooth out some of those.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:28:30):**  Definitely it's funny actually like the I think there's more recognition that talking  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:28:36):**  to farmers and talking to customers and kind of doing that collaborative development so  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:28:40):**  important and yet it's still really hard to do like I think a lot of the same maybe vocal  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:28:45):**  farmers that are out there on Twitter and kind of talking about innovation get their  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:28:50):**  shoulder tapped all the time versus there's others who don't and for you know you don't  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:28:55):**  want to only talk to the same 20 farmers that are the loudest ones because they're not maybe  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:29:00):**  farming the same way as some of the others in the space who aren't as loud but they're  
**[0:29:04-0:29:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:29:04):**  the ones that get the phone call.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:29:05):**  Yeah yep and I find it's the quiet ones that usually have engineered something really amazing  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:29:10):**  on the farm that works just beautifully for a problem that they have been trying to solve  
**[0:29:15-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:29:15):**  for ages so I guess connecting with grower groups and individuals and having a chat around  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:29:22):**  a barbecue is usually the best way.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:29:26):**  Love it more of that kind of social connection as well I mean it's actually been a theme  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:29:29):**  kind of various things you've said that it ends up being more about the people like whether  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:29:32):**  it's the people on your team that are recommending changes or the people overseas that you're  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:29:37):**  connecting with or on the other side of a Twitter post or on the other side of the technology  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:29:42):**  like that's kind of what it comes down to.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:29:45):**  Yeah that was the probably the biggest learning that I had during my Nuffield journey and  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:29:51):**  it was from one of the Kiwi fellows Hamish who we travelled with I was in a group of  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:29:56):**  10 and it really is everything that we do is about the people.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:01):**  We met the most amazing people and you know sometimes there's situations where like really  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:08):**  tiny little farm but you connect with these people and you just listen to their story  
**[0:30:13-0:30:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:13):**  it always comes back to the people so even in a tech driven world there's someone behind  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:20):**  that making it and developing it and they need those connections so that it works really  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:25):**  well.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:26):**  Where if people want to learn more about what you're up to or what you think about cotton  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:31):**  and social license and all of these issues where can they find more about you and from  
**[0:30:35-0:30:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:35):**  you?  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:36):**  Yeah so I am Farmer Renee on Twitter and I do have a Nuffield scholarship page on Facebook  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:42):**  as well and it's just Renee Anderson Nuffield scholar.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:45):**  Cool I will link both of those in the show notes but thank you so much for agreeing to  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:50):**  have a chat.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:51):**  No worries thank you.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:30:59):**  Hey guys Sarah here again with some final comments.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:31:03):**  This conversation with Renee and some of the follow-ups that we had after really got me  
**[0:31:08-0:31:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:31:08):**  thinking.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:31:09):**  Renee and I were talking about science communicators in agriculture so that I could link Renee's  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:31:15):**  favorites to the show notes and she told me that her favorite science communicator just  
**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:31:21):**  quit social media because of racism.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:31:24):**  Now in this episode Renee and I talked about how social media and especially Ag Twitter  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:31:29):**  is largely a positive place where people can share inventions and tips but that's not always  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:31:35):**  the case.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:31:37):**  The incident Renee was referring to was some pretty horrific racist comments from some  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:31:43):**  farmers and then various researchers, science communicators and other farmers calling them  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:31:48):**  out and shaming them and then all of the normal angry yelling and personal insults that you  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:31:54):**  would expect would come next.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:31:57):**  And I guess all this got me thinking about our role as a podcast, as a company and as  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:32:03):**  people in the Ag industry and talking about the Ag industry in today's world amidst the  
**[0:32:09-0:32:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:32:09):**  protests and the social unrest.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:32:12):**  And you know this is still a work in progress but where I've landed at least for today and  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:32:17):**  what I wanted to share with you guys is that I love working in agriculture but Ag definitely  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:32:23):**  does have some social license issues.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:32:26):**  Now some are environmental and these get talked about a lot but some are also around acceptance  
**[0:32:31-0:32:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:32:31):**  of outsiders and even in the worst cases racism and this is not okay and we do have to call  
**[0:32:39-0:32:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:32:39):**  it out and we do have to do better.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:32:42):**  Talking about this stuff isn't easy and yet I know talking alone isn't good enough but  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:32:47):**  hopefully starting to bring these issues to the forefront can raise awareness, can catalyze  
**[0:32:53-0:32:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:32:53):**  action and ultimately can lead to change.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:32:56):**  So I've included some links in the show notes to keep this conversation going.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:33:00):**  There are other people in Ag who are talking about these issues and other people who are  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:33:04):**  taking action.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:33:06):**  If you have ideas, other links or perspectives to share I'd love to hear them.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/social-media-and-social-license#t=0:33:10):**  Thanks guys as always for listening and until next time be safe.

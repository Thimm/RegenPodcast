### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 05 Feb 2020 19:18:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:00:12):**  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:00:17):**  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:00:22):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:00:27):**  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  
**[0:00:31-0:00:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:00:31):**  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. Today's guest is Mick Fels. Mick is someone  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:00:42):**  I've wanted to speak to ever since I read an article he wrote called How I Make Money  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:00:47):**  Out of Ipadic, It's Not What You Think. Mick has built and commercialized a range of products  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:00:52):**  with Ipadic from apps to machinery. And I wanted to chat with him about how he thinks  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:00:57):**  about making money from technology and what building products has taught him about startups  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:01:02):**  and about farming. Mick and I also talk about hard earned lessons and tips for working with  
**[0:01:07-0:01:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:01:07):**  technology, whether ideas or execution matter more, and which is harder farming or building  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:01:14):**  ag tech products. Mick and his wife Marnie farm in Esperance on the south coast of Western  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:01:20):**  Australia. We start with Mick telling us about the farm. We're farming just over 6000 hectares  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:01:26):**  here. We started farming in 93. My wife and I, we got married in 93 and bought our first  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:01:31):**  farm in 93. For the princely summer $40 an acre while our friends were traveling the  
**[0:01:36-0:01:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:01:36):**  world and whatever else they were doing with you. We traded our two cars in to get some  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:01:43):**  capital and bought a farm. So that's sort of how we started out and we sort of built  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:01:46):**  it up from there. We both had engineering degrees before we went farming, which has  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:01:50):**  been a really good career path for us. And we built the farm up and sold the original  
**[0:01:55-0:02:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:01:55):**  property in 2001 and bought into a better area with better rainfall and soils in 2002.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:02:02):**  And we've grown the business since then. So we own about 4000 hectares and we lease another  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:02:06):**  couple of thousand, some off my dad and some off the native. So I'm growing wheat, barley  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:02:11):**  and canola and a little bit of legumes, just playing around with legumes. Take me back  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:02:15):**  to when you and your wife decided to sell your cars and buy a farm. Is that what was  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:02:19):**  the thinking there? Did everyone think you were crazy?  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:02:21):**  They did. No, you hit the nail on the head. So we both went to uni. I was one of the younger  
**[0:02:27-0:02:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:02:27):**  kids in a family of five and I didn't really expect to be a farmer. I always enjoyed growing  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:02:33):**  up on the farm, but I went and did an engineering degree and sorry, loved it. Actually did my  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:02:37):**  honors thesis on aerodynamics of wind turbines. So that I found that fascinating. But I did  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:02:43):**  a little bit of work. I did in the field. I just did not like the office environment  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:02:47):**  at all. Just didn't agree with me. So when I finished uni, I took the opportunity to  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:02:51):**  come home to the farm for six months. Well, that was the plan just to help dad out and  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:02:57):**  just clear my head a bit. I didn't even apply for an engineering job and my wife, she did  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:03:02):**  chemical engineering at Curtin University. I studied at UWA and we met at college actually.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:03:08):**  We're both from the country. She's from up north in WA and we met at college. Had a great  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:03:13):**  time in Perth before the years and she worked for a couple of years as a chem engineer while  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:03:18):**  I was at the farm. My dad talked me into buying a farm that was out on the fringe. It was  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:03:24):**  sort of not in very good shape and it was cheap and it was affordable. So the only capital  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:03:30):**  that we had at the time was our cars. So we downsized and sold one of the cars. This is  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:03:36):**  the year we got married. That was in 93. So we sold one of the cars and scratched up as  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:03:41):**  much as we could. We bootstrapped it, I suppose, is modern language for what we did.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:03:46):**  I love it. We didn't start up firms.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:03:49):**  Yeah, exactly. Just wanted the banks to exceed their normal parameters to lend us the money.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:03:55):**  And yeah, we managed to buy our first farm and sort of did it pretty tough for a few  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:04:00):**  years.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:04:01):**  Was it scary to do that? Like, were you nervous about it?  
**[0:04:03-0:04:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:04:03):**  Well, I don't, I mean, my long-term memory has never been good and I sort of forget things.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:04:10):**  I think I'm busy looking ahead. I forget to sort of retain things. But the only emotions  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:04:16):**  that I recall from back then is excitement, really. Obviously there was stress and everything  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:04:22):**  else with it, but really it was the excitement of the opportunity. And probably one of the  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:04:27):**  saving things for me was I just, I didn't know. I didn't know about farming. I was raised  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:04:32):**  on a farm, but it was a livestock farm predominantly. And we were getting into cropping and just  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:04:37):**  a huge learning curve, which I've always enjoyed learning. It was just a big exciting opportunity.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:04:41):**  I think if we had have known what we were going into, we would have been, we probably  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:04:44):**  should have been frightened, but I think we were just excited. It was really exciting  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:04:49):**  times. We actually went backwards for the first three years, which is, seems to be what  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:04:54):**  we've done every time we bought a farm. We've had a bad run the first few years or just  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:04:58):**  invested heavily in trying to build the property up or something. So, but even then we didn't  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:05:03):**  really worry too much about that. I suppose we had nothing to lose, you know, like we  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:05:08):**  came in with nothing. So the worst that would happen is we'd leave with nothing.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:05:13):**  Mick says that in the early days they probably did make a bunch of mistakes, but he's really  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:05:17):**  positive about these experiences as they've helped him to learn and to get better.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:05:23):**  I've never been the kind of beat myself up for my mistakes because I see them as a learning  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:05:27):**  opportunity. It's the same with, you know, with the ATEC stuff I've got into more recent  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:05:31):**  times. You know, it's normal to make mistakes actually. I sort of push the boundaries a  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:05:36):**  bit and I don't want to make mistakes, but I don't mind making mistakes because there's  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:05:40):**  such great learning experiences and then you can use that learning to do better in the  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:05:44):**  future. So yeah, we've made lots of mistakes along the way, but it's been those mistakes  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:05:49):**  that have sort of made us into good profitable farmers now, I'm sure.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:05:54):**  Yeah, I think that's one of the things we hear a lot on the podcast and other farmers  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:05:57):**  I talk to the biggest kind of advice around, especially some of this AG tech stuff, but  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:06:01):**  I guess farming more generally is you're going to lose some skin along the way.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:06:05):**  Exactly. And, you know, a mistake is only a failure if you don't learn from it. You  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:06:10):**  know, that's sort of one of my sort of senses of how we go about these things. So long as  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:06:16):**  you learn from it, you can actually make a mistake into something valuable. If you're  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:06:21):**  not standing on the edge, you take too much space. Well, that's what he thinks is my attitude.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:06:25):**  So it's a little bit like that. You know, we do push the parameters a fair bit and sometimes  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:06:30):**  that works and sometimes it doesn't. But in the balance, you're constantly learning new  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:06:34):**  things and you retain the things that were good and you drop off the things that didn't  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:06:39):**  work out. And over the long term, and farming is a long game, you know, it pays off.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:06:45):**  An example of Mick pushing the boundaries happened early on when he decided to move  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:06:49):**  from mixed farming to just cropping and to adopt new systems and technologies like controlled  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:06:54):**  traffic to make this change work.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:06:57):**  Well, our controlled traffic journey, I suppose, had been evolving for some time. I think it  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:07:03):**  was about 2002 when I bought my first John Deere auto steer controller, which is 10 years  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:07:09):**  before we sold the cattle. So we never went down the guidance path. I never had a guidance  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:07:14):**  screen or anything. I just went straight into an auto steer controller and put it in the  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:07:17):**  seeder, auto steered the seeder and then left wheel tracks unceded on the seeder and everything  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:07:23):**  else followed those visually. So that was sort of how we started down the path of controlled  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:07:27):**  traffic. I liked the idea of it and I suppose it grew from there. So, you know, about 20  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:07:32):**  years ago now and even now it's still not pure controlled traffic. You know, some of  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:07:37):**  our machines are 2.7 metre wheel tracks and some are 3.2. But I think the important thing  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:07:42):**  is that we've still got, you know, 80% plus of the paddock almost never gets driven on  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:07:48):**  and we do see the benefits. So I suppose it was a pretty slow burn for us. And by 2012,  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:07:54):**  you know, we weren't making money out of the cattle. The prices were disastrous. They're  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:07:58):**  about 25% of what they are nowadays. And yeah, we weren't making a lot of money out of the  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:08:03):**  cattle that would distract us from our cropping business, which has always been our main enterprise.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:08:09):**  And going to Moree, I was looking at some machinery actually and going to Moree and  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:08:12):**  seeing how those guys around there are doing it. You know, I was really motivated when  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:08:16):**  I came home, we had a conversation about it together and decided let's take the plunge  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:08:21):**  and do this thing properly. So that's what we did. And it's been great. Like I'm so pleased.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:08:26):**  I know cattle have improved a lot since then, but as you get older, you get wiser and I'm  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:08:31):**  starting to work out. I think most people can really only specialise in one thing. It's  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:08:36):**  hard to be a specialist in more than one thing and trying to be a specialist in livestock  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:08:41):**  as well as in cropping. Well, for me, I always found that one or the other was being compromised.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:08:46):**  So I do feel like, and in fact, our metrics will show, you know, business performance  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:08:51):**  has definitely improved since we got rid of the cattle. And we can just focus solely on,  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:08:56):**  you know, high performance cropping.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:08:58):**  For Mick, pushing the boundaries hasn't just been about farming systems. It's also about  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:09:02):**  technology and engineering, things he's had a passion for since he was little.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:09:07):**  Yeah, well, I am a sort of a natural innovator. I loved mechanical engineering and you know,  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:09:14):**  as a kid, I was pulling apart bloody transistor radios and motorbike engines and whatever,  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:09:19):**  you know, like I just love knowing how things work. So it worked out well for us when we  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:09:24):**  started farming because like I mentioned, we didn't really have any money to bless ourselves  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:09:29):**  with. So we had a lot of old worn out equipment, but I was able to fix it, get it working and  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:09:35):**  get it working well and modify it to sort of do the job we needed it to do. And even  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:09:40):**  build some of my machinery in those days, you know, out of old metal and whatever. So  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:09:45):**  that certainly helped us to get started. But as the business grew and we started making  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:09:50):**  some profits and being able to buy equipment, I sort of stopped doing all that because it  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:09:55):**  just made more sense to buy what we needed that did the job and get on with actually  
**[0:09:59-0:10:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:09:59):**  farming rather than fabricating things. But we sort of turned a bit of a corner 10 or  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:10:05):**  15 years ago where we started to feel like the things that I knew we needed in our business  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:10:11):**  from my own experience weren't really available. You know, like I'm really trying to customise  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:10:17):**  things a bit and I tended to find it became a bit of a standing joke on the farm as a  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:10:22):**  staff actually that before a new machine could go into the past, it would spend a week at  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:10:26):**  the workshop and that was sort of how it started happening. So I was modifying things a lot  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:10:33):**  because while you can buy something that sort of, I mean, most of this machinery you buy  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:10:37):**  particularly stuff from North America, which is where a lot of it comes from, it's a one  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:10:41):**  size fits all solution. It's the same machine that you get in Canada, the USA, right through  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:10:46):**  Europe, South America, Africa, everywhere. You know, they're all identical equipment,  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:10:51):**  but it's a bit fanciful to think that one machine is going to suit all of those environments.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:10:55):**  So I would always be just fine tuning it, just trying to get that extra bit of performance  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:11:00):**  out of it or make it sort of do more for me.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:11:04):**  Mick has done a lot of this customisation work, tweaking existing products to make them  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:11:08):**  work for his farm. But in a few cases, Mick has gotten to the point where customisation  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:11:13):**  just wasn't enough. It was actually easier and ultimately better to start over and build  
**[0:11:18-0:11:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:11:18):**  something new.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:11:19):**  I was using a John Deere disc seeder and having all sorts of problems with it, but I really  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:11:25):**  liked what the bits were doing to our soil, but it just wasn't performing the way I needed  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:11:29):**  it to in our soils and with our chemistry that we're using. So I heavily modified it  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:11:35):**  and it was working really well, but I had all sorts of reliability problems and I actually  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:11:40):**  decided to start building my own units from the ground up. And that's sort of evolved  
**[0:11:44-0:11:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:11:44):**  over five or six years now into the Alpha Disc, which is an all new unit, which is basically  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:11:51):**  custom made. It's mass produced, but it's custom made for the sorts of things that we're  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:11:56):**  trying to do here in Australia in terms of using Treflan, which is a problem with normal  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:12:01):**  disc seeders and not wetting sands, which are a bit of a problem. But it's sort of dealing  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:12:06):**  with that moisture seeking. All the things that disc seeders don't normally do are the  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:12:10):**  things that I've sort of built into my Alpha Disc. We've seen our water sufficiency and  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:12:16):**  just our overall productivity and profitability just been on a steady rising plane probably  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:12:21):**  pretty much since we started doing that. So I can see that we're definitely on the right  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:12:25):**  track.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:12:26):**  Over time, as technology has improved, mix innovations have gone beyond equipment and  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:12:31):**  machinery to apps and more of what today we call ag tech.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:12:36):**  When the iPads came out in 2011, I got a few iPads with some chemical, it was a bit of  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:12:40):**  a, you know, like one of those freebie things that you actually pay for. But anyway, I got  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:12:44):**  a few iPads, I was keen to try them out. And as soon as I got them, I could just see, you  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:12:49):**  know, that sort of mobile portable device with data sharing was just going to be priceless  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:12:55):**  in our business. And I had a look at all the different apps that were around and I could  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:12:59):**  just see that they were built by IT people, your business people, entrepreneurs, you know,  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:13:03):**  they weren't really catering the sorts of things that I, the practical things that I  
**[0:13:07-0:13:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:13:07):**  knew we could do with those devices. So took the plunge. We're ready for something a bit  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:13:14):**  new in the business and we set up our paddock to develop a couple of apps. And in 2013,  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:13:20):**  we released two apps, which was our paddock spray and our paddock yield. And our paddock  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:13:25):**  spray was really taking control of the spraying operation because we're going through a rapid  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:13:30):**  growth phase in the business at that stage. And I was relying on staff to do a lot more  
**[0:13:34-0:13:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:13:34):**  of the key operations like spraying. And I was having trouble managing our inventory  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:13:40):**  of chemicals and managing the quality control on the spraying and just keeping the communication  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:13:45):**  open between myself and the spray driver. And we were making mistakes, you know, like  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:13:49):**  you'd have a paddock, I've had an instance where a paddock got sprayed twice and I've  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:13:53):**  had other instances where parts of the paddock didn't get sprayed and you thought they had  
**[0:13:57-0:14:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:13:57):**  been, just communication breakdown. So one of those failures can cost you 10, 15, $20,000.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:14:04):**  So I took the plunge and decided to build these apps based on what we knew we needed.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:14:11):**  And I thought, well, if we're going to do this, then we'd be silly not to commercialize  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:14:15):**  it because I'm pretty sure if we need it, then other people do too.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:14:19):**  It was at this time around 2013 that Mick set up iPaddock, a company that would help  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:14:24):**  him bring these apps to market. So what was driving Mick to not only build technology,  
**[0:14:29-0:14:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:14:29):**  but also to commercialize it?  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:14:32):**  Right from the get go, the primary reason for doing it, I suppose, was to develop what  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:14:37):**  we needed. You know, we were growing our business and I could just see the value to our business  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:14:42):**  of having good tools like that. So when Marnie and I discussed it, one of the things that  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:14:48):**  we considered was even if we don't make money out of it, it's worth doing it just, I mean,  
**[0:14:52-0:14:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:14:52):**  this is how crazy it is. And at the end you can buy for $180 in the app store, you know,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:14:59):**  as a buyer of apps, you know, it's cost us thousands of times to produce it. And even  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:15:05):**  then it was still worth doing. So the value proposition for people just buying the app  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:15:11):**  is pretty good. But even in our case, even if we didn't sell a single copy, it was really  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:15:16):**  a case of needing it for our business. So the way we priced our apps, it's sort of a  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:15:21):**  protest really. Like I get grumpy at all these, you know, everybody wants you to sign up to  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:15:27):**  an account and pay subscriptions before you've even seen what the product is and then you're  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:15:32):**  locked in and it's really hard to get out again. So it probably doesn't make a lot of  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:15:38):**  sense from a business point of view, but we just had a low entry price and no subscription.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:15:44):**  So when you work it out, we never really set out to make any great fortunes out of my apps.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:15:51):**  And as much as anything, I just, I sort of have a passion for the industry and I'm a  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:15:55):**  bit of a sharer. Anybody who follows me on Twitter will know that. I like to share and  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:16:00):**  I like to share in a two way stream, you know, people helping me and me helping people where  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:16:05):**  I can. And I suppose really the apps have always been a bit of an adjunct to our business  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:16:12):**  and I sort of don't mind having them there and supporting them because I know how important  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:16:18):**  they are to the people who use them. And I guess in some ways it's a bit of a contribution  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:16:22):**  to the industry that I love is helping drive the productivity of the industry.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:16:28):**  Another reason Mick felt it was important to create iPatic was because he saw limitations  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:16:32):**  in the current system of research and development, whether from big or small companies or research  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:16:37):**  organizations or industry bodies, he's seen a lot of money and time being wasted on products  
**[0:16:43-0:16:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:16:43):**  that weren't actually helping farmers.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:16:44):**  That sort of takes me back to my motivation for doing this stuff. You know, a lot of my  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:16:49):**  friends look at me and think, why the hell do you do this? You know, like, just go and  
**[0:16:52-0:16:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:16:52):**  buy what you need and just put up with it. Don't constantly have the need to change things.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:16:59):**  But I do get frustrated because I can tell people to I'm blue in the face what I need  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:17:03):**  and they just keep churning out the same stuff. And same with our R&D system. It's become  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:17:08):**  very bureaucratic. I mean, there's hundreds of millions of dollars every year invested.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:17:12):**  A lot of that directly from people like me on our farms. But by the time the good idea  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:17:18):**  is make it through the food chain, it's really difficult to actually get progress in terms  
**[0:17:24-0:17:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:17:24):**  of innovative solutions. So the established process, and it makes commercial sense, but  
**[0:17:31-0:17:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:17:31):**  the conventional process, I guess, is to commercialize stuff that you know there's a market for. And  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:17:38):**  what that actually means is anything innovative and disruptive, you have to actually build  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:17:42):**  that market and you're not going to get a great commercial return on it any time soon  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:17:47):**  unless you plan to stick with it for 10 or 15 years. So getting the R&D bodies and commercial,  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:17:52):**  you know, mainstream brands to develop stuff like that, it ain't gonna happen in my last  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:17:57):**  time. So if you feel strongly enough about it, you've really got to get in there and  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:18:01):**  do it yourself, pick up the shovel, do the work. And I mean, we're very fortunate. We've  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:18:05):**  got a good farm business which pretty much bankrolls iPatic for us. So iPatic doesn't  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:18:11):**  have to sort of churn out a profit every year, or certainly doesn't have to churn out a big  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:18:15):**  profit. Mind you, the money keeps a blow torch on me to make sure we're not losing money  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:18:21):**  with it. But you know, we do have the security of our farm business. So yeah, we're not compelled  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:18:27):**  to be turning out a million dollars turnover every year from iPatic. So it's good, we can,  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:18:32):**  it's really our own R&D program, which we're commercializing, and that's iPatic.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:18:38):**  But doing it yourself isn't always easy. Though there's a whole ecosystem of options out there,  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:18:43):**  people who really want to help startups and programs like accelerators and incubators,  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:18:48):**  for someone like Mick, who's farming full time, it can be really hard to get access  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:18:52):**  to this support in a way that works for him.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:18:55):**  This is so difficult when you're a farmer, because you're already isolated, you're not  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:19:00):**  in the networks where you meet people who can do stuff for you and other people you  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:19:04):**  can share knowledge with. And in Esperance, you know, we're in Western Australia, and  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:19:09):**  there's very small sort of technology seen in WA, because most people go straight to  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:19:14):**  Melbourne if they want to sort of further their careers. So I'm in a remote part of  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:19:19):**  WA, which is a remote part of Australia, and Australia is a remote part of the world. So  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:19:24):**  just having access to people who can do the sort of stuff that I'm trying to do, and trying  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:19:29):**  to build skills, and even access to things like Spratix, and your Farmers for Founders,  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:19:34):**  you know, those kinds of things are great, but very difficult for someone in my situation  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:19:39):**  who's full time running a farming business. You know, I don't have family, I don't have  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:19:43):**  other family on the farm other than my wife, of course, sort of no one to fall back on  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:19:47):**  and I can't just disappear for two or three months. So yeah, that's been one of the biggest  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:19:52):**  challenges really is those sort of the time limitations and the access to support and  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:19:58):**  networks and all of the other things that come with it.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:20:02):**  So what has Mick learned? And what does it mean for I-PATIC?  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:20:05):**  Like I said, I've sort of been around the circuit a couple of times, and I'm probably  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:20:08):**  at a point now where I guess I understand some of those constraints and I'm working  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:20:12):**  within them. So I haven't downscaled I-PATIC or anything like that, but I'll probably revise  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:20:19):**  my expectations in terms of, you know, how quickly we can reach our goal with I-PATIC  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:20:24):**  and how important it is to, you know, to sell it and flog it and all that stuff. I've sort  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:20:29):**  of backed out of those kinds of things that were taking an awful lot of my time. And while  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:20:34):**  I-PATIC as a standalone business, I think the sky's the limit really in terms of what  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:20:40):**  the potential of that business is to actually realize that would take me away from our farm,  
**[0:20:45-0:20:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:20:45):**  which is worth a lot more to us than I-PATIC is.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:20:48):**  Has anyone ever approached you to partner and maybe integrate it with some other tech  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:20:52):**  and kind of take on some of that and still reward you for it, but you wouldn't have to  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:20:56):**  do the work? Has that ever come up or been an option or something you considered?  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:21:01):**  I think that's every entrepreneur's dream that you come with the ideas and someone else  
**[0:21:05-0:21:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:21:05):**  takes all the risk and does all the development. It doesn't happen. What my experience has  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:21:13):**  been is if you have a new idea that you know is a good one, which I've had and there  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:21:18):**  have been good ones, and I know that because the people who buy and use them love them.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:21:22):**  And certainly I know the value that we get from them ourselves. But to start with something  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:21:28):**  like that, which other people haven't thought of, it's a hard sell. You're pretty unlikely  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:21:34):**  to get other people to adopt that and then offer to buy it from you. In my experience,  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:21:40):**  what happens is you have to do all the hard graft, take all the risk, invest all the money  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:21:45):**  and do all the development and the prototyping and all the waste that goes with prototyping  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:21:49):**  when you come up with something that's not better than what you had before and so on.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:21:53):**  And then once you've got something that's just a hit, then it's of value to people.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:21:57):**  But unfortunately, what I've found is once it's of value, then people try to take it  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:22:03):**  from you rather than buy it from you. So there's all sorts of challenges. It's sad, but it's  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:22:09):**  true. You know, that's actually, I'm sort of a little bit gun shy now because of some  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:22:14):**  negative experience I've had and that I'm still having there. You sort of become a bit  
**[0:22:19-0:22:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:22:19):**  gun shy and less inclined to sort of put yourself out there until you've got all your eyes  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:22:26):**  guided and your teeth crossed. But unfortunately that does limit the uptake of innovation and  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:22:30):**  the development of innovation because a lot of people go through the same experience where  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:22:35):**  they do all the hard work and then someone else just tries to take all the profit from  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:22:38):**  them. So there's also, I don't want to be negative and I'm not negative, like I'm  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:22:44):**  buoyant and optimistic about all of the things that we're doing. But like I say, I've said  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:22:50):**  it a few times, when you get older, you get wiser. And I suppose one of the lessons I've  
**[0:22:56-0:23:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:22:56):**  learned has been farming is a damn sight easier than being an entrepreneur. So farming is  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:23:03):**  not easy as everybody knows, but I tell you, trying to mix it in the cut and trust of the  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:23:08):**  commercial world where there's a lot of people out there who don't seem to share your same  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:23:13):**  sort of idea about fairness. Yeah, farming is a much easier place to make a crust and  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:23:19):**  it's a much better place to trade. So there's all sorts of challenges there, but there's  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:23:24):**  opportunities as well. This is a learning experience and like I said earlier, you make  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:23:29):**  mistakes and it's not bad to make mistakes. What's the saying? It's good to fail fast.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:23:35):**  And it is. And we've done a bit of that and you learn along the way and you get wiser  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:23:40):**  and in the long game it pays off. But in the short term it can hurt a little bit.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:23:45):**  Are there any things you learned from the ag tech side that you've taken back to the  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:23:50):**  farming business? Like any lessons that have gone back the other way?  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:23:54):**  Probably the lean development approach is an important one. And for the benefit of people  
**[0:23:59-0:24:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:23:59):**  who don't know quite what that means. Basically lean development means to do things in incremental  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:24:06):**  stages and to be constantly testing what you're doing before you expand it to the next step. So  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:24:13):**  in contrast, the traditional approach to development was, I think they call it the  
**[0:24:17-0:24:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:24:17):**  waterfall approach, where you have this idea, so you sit down and you build it as long as it takes  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:24:24):**  with all its features and all its pre- and then you use it and if it doesn't work, well you just  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:24:30):**  waste that entire process. Whereas lean development is more about starting with a minimum viable  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:24:36):**  product. There you go, there's another jargon word for you. And so basically just develop the  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:24:41):**  absolute base minimum version of what it is that you're talking about, start testing it  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:24:45):**  and work out what it is that's good and what it is that's bad and then you build the next feature  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:24:49):**  and then you start testing that and then you build the next feature and you start testing that. And  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:24:53):**  if something doesn't work, you pivot, you change direction and you make a little iterative changes  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:24:59):**  all along the way. And one of the benefits of that is, is you don't get halfway through a really high  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:25:04):**  investment process and then the wheels fall off for some reason, you've got nothing, you've got  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:25:09):**  half of something which is useless. Whereas with the lean development process, you've always got  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:25:14):**  something and then you can keep adding to it. So on the farm, you know, a lot of the R&D that we do  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:25:20):**  on our farm and we do have a pretty extensive R&D program, it's not a formal one, but you know,  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:25:25):**  I've got lots of kegs on the driveways, marking out all the different trials that we're doing.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:25:30):**  And it's the same thing, you know, rather than sort of just decide I'm going to build an air  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:25:35):**  seeder system, a feeding system and just have an idea and then build it and then who knows whether  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:25:40):**  it's going to work on it. This has been, you know, 5, 6, 7 years in the making, the alpha disc and  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:25:46):**  every year it's sort of been improved on a little bit and I'm finally at the point now where I've  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:25:50):**  got a machine that we're mass producing and it's a really good machine. So if I hadn't just started  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:25:55):**  out building what I thought was a good idea at the start, it may never have been any good and it may  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:26:00):**  well have cost us an awful lot more. One thing we hear a lot from farmers is all these ag tech  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:26:06):**  startups are trying to flog us a half-built product and then the ag tech startups are saying,  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:26:10):**  no, no, it's just an MVP, like it's just the early version and then I guess that's, it's an  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:26:15):**  interesting kind of question because we often tell entrepreneurs, well, if they're saying that, then  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:26:20):**  it's actually not an MVP, you know, it's not valuable, you haven't hit the minimum yet, but  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:26:24):**  there is definitely a tension in that it's, you know, it's not fully there yet, it's not better  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:26:29):**  than maybe the giant spreadsheet that you've built and used for 20 years, but it's hopefully adds some  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:26:34):**  kind of value. I don't know, do you have any thoughts on that kind of tension in the tech world?  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:26:38):**  Look, I think it's okay to have a minimum viable product in the market so long as it's priced  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:26:44):**  accordingly or it might even be free, but what's not okay, I mean, as I've mentioned, I'm primarily  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:26:49):**  a farmer, you know, farming is our bread and butter, the ag tech stuff is very much a sideline,  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:26:56):**  so I'm speaking as a farmer here and that was what actually motivated me to a large degree to do what  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:27:02):**  I've done with Hypatic was you'd be paying really high prices for a lot of this stuff that would be  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:27:08):**  pedalled out to us by big companies and small companies and you'd get it and half of it didn't  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:27:12):**  work and it would be buggy and it wouldn't work when you've got no phone range and there's no  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:27:17):**  support, you ring up and then you've got to sign up for a support service to get support for  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:27:21):**  something which should have worked in the first place and it doesn't, you know, that's not  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:27:26):**  really minimum viable product, that's just a rip-off, so I think if you have a base level  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:27:32):**  product that works really well but it doesn't have too many bells and whistles on it and it's priced  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:27:37):**  accordingly, I think that's fair enough and not that that's what we've done with Hypatic, but the  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:27:43):**  apps that I've released, there's a whole lot more that we're doing to the apps and features that  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:27:47):**  we're adding but the apps as they stand now are really good valuable apps and they add value to  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:27:51):**  every farm business and they're cheap enough to buy, so there is a value proposition there and  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:27:57):**  people appreciate that but yeah, no, it has been a bit of a scam and the reason why is most of  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:28:03):**  these things, most of the technology and even the equipment that we buy, they're coming from a  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:28:09):**  position of someone trying to make a heap of money, which is fair enough, we all want to make money  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:28:14):**  but that shouldn't be the primary reason for doing something which it is for a lot of this stuff, so  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:28:19):**  you know, the machinery is going up five, eight percent every year and it's not really performing  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:28:23):**  any better, in fact it breaks down more, the software is, you know, several thousand dollars a  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:28:29):**  year to have a subscription to some software package that still crashes and doesn't really do  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:28:33):**  what you want it to do, that's not a good base proposition from my point of view and I've actually  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:28:38):**  found doing it ourselves, even though it has been an expensive process, at least we've got what we  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:28:44):**  want and what we need and the value to us hasn't been through selling apps and machinery, it's been  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:28:50):**  through improving our productivity and our profitability on our farm and a lot of the time  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:28:54):**  that actually has been through just reducing costs, like for instance with our feeding system  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:28:59):**  that we're using now, we harvest tall because we're using this, so we're saving money at harvest,  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:29:05):**  we can have less headers going faster and losing less grain, so there's a lot of profit there,  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:29:09):**  we don't touch the stubbles until, you know, until we sow them the next year, we're not out there  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:29:13):**  with slashes and double choppers and doing all this other stuff that other people have to do  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:29:17):**  in the running time, so while at faith, you can look at this in time and say, oh look they do a  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:29:22):**  similar job, when you look at the profit, I mean it surprises us some years how much profit we make  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:29:27):**  when we really don't think we've performed spectacularly well and it's really because  
**[0:29:32-0:29:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:29:32):**  we're still performing well but we're not having all the costs, so the value to all this innovation  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:29:39):**  that we've been doing is just, it's really reflected on the bottom line for our farm business.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:29:45):**  Yep, I think that is something that many of the startups don't understand and you get it when you  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:29:50):**  don't come from agriculture, haven't spent time on farms, they haven't actually thought about what  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:29:55):**  the real drivers are in the business and so maybe they're only solving for one part of the system  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:29:59):**  but they haven't thought about where that actual real value can be unlocked or what will really  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:30:04):**  move the needle. And that's what I find actually with a lot of the solutions these days, everyone's  
**[0:30:08-0:30:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:30:08):**  excited about IoT and you know, telematics on the headers and all this stuff, it costs a lot of  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:30:15):**  money to have as complexity to your business and okay it's nice to look at your computer and see  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:30:20):**  you know where your head is driven around or you know see what the fuel consumption was or  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:30:24):**  something but how is that actually adding to my bottom line? You know for me, adding to my bottom  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:30:29):**  line means reducing my cost in a tangible way you know, doing less passes across the paddock  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:30:35):**  or getting the job done more quickly or having better communication or making sure that every  
**[0:30:40-0:30:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:30:40):**  paddy gets braved with exactly the right amount of product, it's those kind of things that they  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:30:43):**  don't reflect directly onto the bottom line and they're few and far between in a lot of the  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:30:48):**  solutions that we can just buy off the shelf because we're paying more and more for all the  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:30:52):**  technology and our equipment now and it really does all this stuff that it looks nice but really  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:30:57):**  it's complicating life and it's not actually adding to the bottom line so I'm not actually  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:31:01):**  the bloke who buys all that stuff, I try to option it out as much as I can because I just want a big  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:31:06):**  capacity machine that's going to be productive and get the job done efficiently and that's  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:31:11):**  actually getting harder and harder to find even though we're paying more and more for all this.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:31:16):**  Well Anne what did you say before? You're gonna have to go take it in the shed for a week anyways  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:31:19):**  and rip it apart so it'll take you a bit longer. I'm still doing it yeah even now like I'm buying  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:31:25):**  all this stuff and quite often the time in the shed is actually spent just disconnecting all the  
**[0:31:29-0:31:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:31:29):**  things that came on the machine because they just drive me mental. I know my dad is exactly like  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:31:37):**  this, I get a new backpack and he's got to tweak it, he's got to cut off the strap and reattach it  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:31:43):**  like it's my whole life so I totally understand what equipment's the worst. Mick you mentioned  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:31:48):**  the lean start of the book before and are there any other resources, books, podcasts, anything  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:31:53):**  that you'd recommend or mention that have been valuable to you in your journey? I read a book  
**[0:31:59-0:32:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:31:59):**  a few years ago called How to Build a Billion Dollar App I think it was and that was good. I've  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:32:06):**  read a few of these books over the years and not that I plan to build a billion dollar app but  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:32:10):**  it's just lots of good tips in there. In fact some of that stuff I wish I had read before I started  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:32:14):**  because there were some like golden rules in there which would have been quite useful when I was  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:32:20):**  starting out. What not to do and you know one of the big problems I've had actually probably my  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:32:26):**  biggest limitation with the app side of it is that I'm not a coder. I mean I learned computer  
**[0:32:31-0:32:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:32:31):**  programming when I was at uni and I wrote programs and stuff when I was there but the world's moved  
**[0:32:35-0:32:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:32:35):**  on since you know the 90s and I could learn to code but again farming's my bread and butter and  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:32:41):**  it would take me too long and it's not really my cup of tea. So I've had to use third parties to do  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:32:46):**  100% of that side of it and when it comes to building machinery I love welding. I'm  
**[0:32:52-0:32:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:32:52):**  quite practical. I've got all the gear down at the shed so I can actually build the prototypes  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:32:58):**  myself and then I can give them to somebody and say look I want you to mass produce this  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:33:02):**  and that's just been such an advantage. I wish I could do that with my tech stuff  
**[0:33:06-0:33:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:33:06):**  because my designs are good they work well but it's a really long and difficult process trying  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:33:13):**  to communicate to someone who specializes in coding exactly what it is that I need.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:33:19):**  In fact quite often they try to get involved in the design but they don't really understand  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:33:23):**  the application so you're not going backwards or forwards a lot and it's just a much harder  
**[0:33:29-0:33:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:33:29):**  thing when you can't do it yourself and I think the people who have done spectacularly well  
**[0:33:35-0:33:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:33:35):**  you know you look at Twitter and all your Facebook and all these things the people who  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:33:39):**  built them they are the people who do it and you've got the skill and you're not having to  
**[0:33:43-0:33:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:33:43):**  try to explain your amazing ideas to someone who can actually you know type it into a computer.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:33:50):**  You know that's probably if there was one word of advice for people wanting to go down this  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:33:54):**  pathway is if you have to outsource or the technical side of it you're already on the  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:33:58):**  back foot. So I wish you know in a perfect world I wish I could have had a better idea  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:34:04):**  and I wish I could have had an outsider who was the technical person working with me on this stuff.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:34:11):**  Another big thing that Mick has learned on his journey is actually something that we talk a lot  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:34:15):**  about at Agtentik that ideas are important but it's execution that really matters.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:34:22):**  It's not actually I heard a quote not that long ago was that the world needs thinkers  
**[0:34:27-0:34:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:34:27):**  and the world needs doers but what the world needs most is thinkers who are doers.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:34:30):**  That's great. Which is actually you know and I guess you know everyone has ideas a number of times  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:34:36):**  people have contacted me said oh look I've got this great idea I want to make an app or whatever  
**[0:34:40-0:34:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:34:40):**  it is you know what do you reckon and I need to say a reply was just one word which is no there's  
**[0:34:47-0:34:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:34:47):**  like a hundred o's in it. Like you know it ain't an easy process you've got to be absolutely  
**[0:34:56-0:35:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:34:56):**  committed to go down that pathway but yeah no it's you know it's one thing to have an idea  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:35:02):**  and it's another thing to actually turn it into reality and probably the key thing is persistence.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:35:06):**  Like it's just a long hard slog particularly if you want to make a dollar out of it and I've been  
**[0:35:13-0:35:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:35:13):**  lucky I haven't had to get investors in because we've been able to bankroll it through the farm  
**[0:35:16-0:35:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:35:16):**  business and while it would have been nice to have investors in terms of the mentoring and  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:35:22):**  the experience that comes with that what I do enjoy is not having other people telling me look  
**[0:35:28-0:35:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:35:28):**  you might think that's a great practical feature but we're going to dump it because we need to put  
**[0:35:31-0:35:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:35:31):**  something in that makes it sell more which I don't like you know I don't have to deal with that so  
**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:35:36):**  yeah I don't know it's an interesting sort of interesting experience.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:35:42):**  Yeah I think it's something we're really proud I mean now I wear an investor hat too right but the  
**[0:35:46-0:35:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:35:46):**  balance between how do you stay like I guess I truly believe and we wouldn't be doing what we're  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:35:52):**  doing if I didn't that staying truly user-centric and building what the users want and will truly  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:35:58):**  add value is the only way to build a good business and you have to believe that you make money out of  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:36:02):**  that down the road but I totally understand the challenge that you have which is slightly a  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:36:06):**  different one of just how do you spend your limited time and you have one activity that's way  
**[0:36:10-0:36:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:36:10):**  more profitable than than the other so that that makes a whole lot of sense that you have to pick  
**[0:36:14-0:36:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:36:14):**  that one. Yeah well and what it may mean is it just limits you know what we do with our padding  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:36:20):**  when I first started out I thought you know let's just let's just see what happens and I just knew  
**[0:36:26-0:36:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:36:26):**  that the potential for what we were doing was you know was global and massive but you know it's  
**[0:36:30-0:36:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:36:30):**  probably what I how I started the conversation you know you can't really be a specialist in two  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:36:34):**  things if you want to be a specialist it's probably you're going to have to focus on one and for me  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:36:39):**  I've chosen farming now it doesn't mean I can't do the whole egg check and the startup side of it  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:36:44):**  because we are doing it and it's successful but I can't really expect to be the next Bill Gates as  
**[0:36:50-0:36:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:36:50):**  well as you know a profitable successful farmer you have to choose and you know farming is what  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:36:56):**  I love that's what sort of drives it also that's what I've chosen and then the other thing just  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:37:00):**  has to sort of has you know I have to devote my spare reserves to it rather than it being my core  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:37:06):**  exercise I guess it's a pretty good hobby to have though of all the things you could be doing that  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:37:10):**  are probably a lot worse for you it's great look I love it and I've got to meet some amazing people  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:37:16):**  I've you know I've got I've had some great experiences I won the um growth awards productivity  
**[0:37:22-0:37:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:37:22):**  in 2017 I think that was and I think a lot of that was largely on the improvement to national  
**[0:37:29-0:37:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:37:29):**  farmer productivity because of the sorts of innovations that I've developed you know which  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:37:33):**  was a real honour and I got to go on an international study career as part of that prize  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:37:38):**  and I met some really good people and I think now of all the things that we've adopted in our  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:37:43):**  business just on the back of some of those kinds of things I've been exposed to I think it's  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:37:49):**  actually central to why our business is performing well these days is is all these other experiences  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:37:55):**  and learnings that we've had which don't necessarily relate directly to farming so you know no  
**[0:38:00-0:38:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:38:00):**  education is wasted and every every experience you have can be useful and it's just it's just  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:38:06):**  an amazing journey I'm loving every second of it it's great to um yeah I hear you so positive  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=570327#t=0:38:12):**  I feel like some of um some of your I read more of your no with a thousand oh comments on Twitter

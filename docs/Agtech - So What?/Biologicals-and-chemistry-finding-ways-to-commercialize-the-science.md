**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:00:58):**  That's Jacqueline Hurd, the founder and CEO of Enco Chem, an agtech startup that has raised  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:01:03):**  $70 million to develop novel crop protection solutions.

**[0:01:39-0:01:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:01:39):**  and get to impact and returns.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:01:42):**  And just for transparency, before we jump in, Nancy's startup RapidAIM is one of our

**[0:01:53-0:01:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:01:53):**  scientific discoveries just weren't having an impact for farmers.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:01:59):**  Probably about 30 years ago, I became interested in entomology because of the way in which  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:02:06):**  insects compete with humans for food and the often very environmentally unacceptable ways  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:02:11):**  that we use to control them.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:02:13):**  I was taking a class at university and thought, wow, I could have a career in really trying  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:02:21):**  to solve this problem.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:02:23):**  So that's how I got into it.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:02:25):**  And I was, until very recently, I was a research scientist at the CSIRO looking to solve, basically,  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:02:33):**  to arrive at sustainable pest management, so landscape scale pest management.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:02:38):**  And something that I always noticed was that it didn't matter how exciting our research  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:02:42):**  was, there was a massive barrier for growers to adopt more sustainable practice.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:02:48):**  And it was mostly that pest management was a guessing game.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:02:51):**  So they needed to use insecticide, not just to kill pests, but as insurance to reduce  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:02:56):**  the risk of pests causing damage.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:00):**  Was there a particular pest that you were initially interested in?  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:03):**  You mentioned kind of sitting there in that class and thinking about pests competing with  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:06):**  humans.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:07):**  Was there like an example or a kind of pest or a part of the system that got you really  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:11):**  interested?  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:13):**  Well I guess at first I thought I was going to be a zoo vet.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:16):**  And then I did an internship at the St. Louis Zoo and realized that that wasn't quite as  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:19):**  exciting as I thought.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:21):**  It wasn't so much a particular pest.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:23):**  It was at the same time that there was a greater demand to have the thinking around agricultural  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:29):**  systems using more ecology.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:32):**  So agricultural ecology was really starting to become popular there.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:35):**  And it was around sustainability, around thinking about the biology of organisms and how to  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:44):**  use biologicals and beneficial organisms to suppress pests.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:48):**  And it was more about how you created the environment suitable for the good insects.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:54):**  So things like ladybird beetles and insect predators that feed on pests and lace wings  
**[0:03:59-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:03:59):**  and parasitic wasps to suppress pests to basically reduce the damage that it was causing on crops.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:07):**  So it was more of the concepts than a particular pest in, I'd say.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:12):**  And did you learn about that at the zoo?  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:13):**  Like I'm really curious about the zoo part.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:15):**  How did you end up at a zoo in St. Louis?  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:17):**  Well originally I thought I was going to be a veterinarian.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:21):**  And so that's what I was doing for my undergraduate.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:23):**  And then the St. Louis Zoo recruited about four of us because the zoos often have problems  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:27):**  with inbreeding depressions.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:30):**  And that's quantitative genetics.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:31):**  And quantitative genetics was my minor.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:33):**  And so then I thought, well, I should be a zoo vet then because I could do both quantitative  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:37):**  genetics and veterinarian practice at the zoo.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:41):**  But it's really not all that cracked up to be.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:45):**  So I went back and did my master's and it was in agriculture ecology or in the area  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:50):**  of ecology.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:51):**  And it was the agriculture class and entomology that I first learned a lot about insects and  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:57):**  just the amount of damage that they cause.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:04:59):**  And even today with our, you know, 40 years on from really using the best tools that we  
**[0:05:05-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:05):**  have for pest management, we still lose about 37% of our crops to insect pests.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:13):**  And in fact, our insecticide use hasn't declined at all.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:16):**  So it is a huge, challenging problem.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:19):**  You mentioned the agro-ecological phrase.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:22):**  And I remember when I was in grad school, I used that phrase in a presentation and sort  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:27):**  of almost phrased it like, of course, we need to move in this direction for all those reasons  
**[0:05:31-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:31):**  you just cited and how critical it was.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:33):**  And I expected that was going to be taken as given and then we could move past it into,  
**[0:05:37-0:05:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:37):**  you know, whatever research I was doing.

**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:40):**  So I don't know what's your experience been with that phrase and some of these concepts  
**[0:05:44-0:05:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:44):**  of using more of nature to be a solution?  
**[0:05:47-0:05:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:47):**  Have you met resistance?  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:48):**  And I don't know how has that changed over time?  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:51):**  Yeah, fascinating observation, Sarah.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:54):**  Yes, certainly.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:56):**  You know, when you're a researcher, you're always playing in the future.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:05:59):**  You have a view about how things could be better and you're testing hypothesis.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:06:05):**  But the realities are that we all love to have our fresh food that doesn't cost a lot.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:06:12):**  And industrial agriculture has meant that we have very low cost food, but it is not  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:06:18):**  often amenable to practices that are super sustainable, which often take a lot of labor  
**[0:06:24-0:06:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:06:24):**  and knowledge and skill.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:06:26):**  So it's not a given.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:06:28):**  And the interesting thing is for years at CSIRO, I worked in the area of landscape scale  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:06:33):**  pest management, which was really about agricultural mosaics, mosaics of native remnant vegetation  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:06:39):**  that we demonstrated time and time again was fantastic habitat for these beneficial organisms  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:06:45):**  and also native fauna and flora.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:06:47):**  But the beneficial organisms like your ladybird beetles and your lice wings and your parasitoids  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:06:52):**  that would then move into the crops and provide pest control.  
**[0:06:57-0:06:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:06:57):**  The challenge is that we hadn't solved the big problem.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:06:59):**  And the big problem was that farmers still had to guess about pest management.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:07:04):**  And so applying insecticide across a field and a farm, it's a means of insurance.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:07:10):**  And it's about reducing the risk of loss and cost from insect pests.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:07:13):**  And that was actually the huge motivational piece for us to leave CSIRO and take our technology  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:07:20):**  to the marketplace.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:07:22):**  Jacqueline Hurd entered the startup world much earlier on in her career.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:07:26):**  She joined a small startup after finishing her postdoc and was then recruited by Monsanto  
**[0:07:30-0:07:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:07:30):**  to work in their in-house venture capital team.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:07:33):**  But science has always been her passion.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:07:35):**  Well, I think science for me, it was I was always interested in nature, I guess.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:07:42):**  I loved I had a little notebook where I watched squirrel behavior from my bedroom window.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:07:50):**  I mean, so and so I guess that's sort of like a scientific method.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:07:54):**  I knew I had to record it.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:07:55):**  So I guess I was always meant to be a scientist.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:07:59):**  And then it was like, okay, well, I love animals.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:08:02):**  So maybe a veterinarian or maybe a doctor.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:08:04):**  And then and then I started taking classes.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:08:07):**  I was pre-med.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:08:08):**  I started taking classes in science and I absolutely loved the creativity of designing  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:08:14):**  an experiment, you know, the killer experiment to answer the right question, to know if you  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:08:19):**  should go forward in this way or not, and to build upon knowledge that had been created  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:08:25):**  before you.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:08:26):**  And so that's when I turned to biotech and to do biotech work instead of going into medicine.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:08:33):**  It's not super common for someone with a PhD and who's been in the research world to end  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:08:37):**  up not only in startups, but then also in venture capital.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:08:41):**  Where did that come from?  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:08:42):**  How did you decide you wanted to be on the entrepreneurship side?  
**[0:08:45-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:08:45):**  Yeah, I think it's this it was always this passion for the combination of being a change  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:08:52):**  agent and then fascinated with technology as a scientist.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:08:56):**  So I was given opportunities to move more and more toward the business side of things  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:09:02):**  and and really found that the combination of technology and business were really an  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:09:08):**  entrepreneurship or the place the place that really I felt home.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:09:13):**  When you joined Monsanto, was there the same kind of, I would call it, you know, perception  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:09:18):**  challenges around Monsanto that they've come to be known for?  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:09:22):**  And did that play into your decision at all, given the kind of focus on impact that you  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:09:26):**  have?  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:09:27):**  Yeah, actually, it did.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:09:29):**  So when I started my career in ag and I went to a startup, there was really no venture  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:09:33):**  community.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:09:34):**  There was no venture ecosystem for agriculture.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:09:37):**  And so the way you got money to start your little company was to do collaborations with  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:09:42):**  one of the majors.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:09:43):**  And so my perspective of joining Monsanto, even though I knew it was large, multinational  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:09:50):**  that had probably some reputational issues, was they were being the most forward thinking  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:09:57):**  in terms of innovation and sourcing innovation.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:10:00):**  I mean, look what their acquisition of Climate Corp did for the idea of digital agronomy.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:10:05):**  I mean, they were at the forefront of so many things.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:10:08):**  So, you know, probably some things around ways in which they could have communicated  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:10:13):**  what they were trying to accomplish a little better.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:10:15):**  But I really came to respect the company for its forward thinking, its innovation, its  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:10:21):**  motivation for change and to try to do good in the industry and for the world.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:10:27):**  Yeah, I remember that was when we first met some of the conversations we had because I  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:10:31):**  was on a sort of personal journey of figuring out how to think about this space and were  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:10:36):**  there good players and evil players and or is everyone in this kind of gray area and  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:10:40):**  how does it all work and what's the role of science?  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:10:42):**  And so I appreciate your insight on that, you know, the role of big companies in driving  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:10:46):**  change and in partnering with small companies, which is what you kind of did in helping to  
**[0:10:50-0:10:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:10:50):**  form Monsanto Growth Ventures.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:10:51):**  Was that like, what's the story behind how that came to be?  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:10:54):**  Well, it's interesting because, you know, before that, my role was I led a platform  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:11:00):**  around discovery in the biotech organization at Monsanto and we were starting little companies.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:11:06):**  So we would sort of give them capital to start the company and then we would start a research  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:11:12):**  collaboration with them.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:11:13):**  And then at the end of the day, we'd grow the value of the company and end up acquiring  
**[0:11:17-0:11:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:11:17):**  it.

**[0:11:30-0:11:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:11:30):**  true M&A.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:11:32):**  But through these collaborations and other modes, I think there was a realization in  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:11:36):**  the Global Strategy Group that perhaps there's a different way to source innovation.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:11:42):**  And then at that time, of course, there were there was a budding sort of venture capital  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:11:48):**  ecosystem in agriculture.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:11:50):**  So it seemed like the right time to look at that as a as a way, a new way to source innovation  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:11:55):**  for the company.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:11:56):**  And so, you know, we started by some sort of an open innovation model.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:12:01):**  We said, OK, there's some entrepreneurs that have some really interesting intellectual  
**[0:12:04-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:12:04):**  property.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:12:05):**  I think they could do things that would really help what we're trying to accomplish.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:12:09):**  You start a little company and then you grow it and buy it.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:12:12):**  So it was a little bit of the same of the same model that we were doing before, but  
**[0:12:17-0:12:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:12:17):**  it was more explicit.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:12:18):**  And then we grew to investing in things like Blue River and technologies, which is acquired  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:12:25):**  by John Deere and all of these different things.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:12:29):**  And then, of course, the Climate Coreback acquisition, which led to a lot of other sort  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:12:34):**  of sourcing other additional modeling companies that could that could grow that internal platform.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:12:40):**  So one of the questions that gets asked is like, why couldn't the big company just do  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:12:45):**  it themselves, especially, I think, in the space where it's pretty heavy R&D and you  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:12:50):**  need a lot of scientific expertise?  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:12:52):**  It seems like it's not as obvious that some scrappy startup in a garage could actually  
**[0:12:57-0:12:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:12:57):**  do it better.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:12:58):**  What would your response to that be?  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:13:01):**  I do think that big companies can be innovative, but I think it's a little bit of a mindset.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:13:07):**  So if you're really good at commercialization, there are a lot of checks and balances and  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:13:10):**  people are kept a little bit constrained in the things that you could do, even though  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:13:15):**  the company were we were always trying to think of ways.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:13:18):**  Well, how can we can we give 10 percent of time to people to do just whatever they want  
**[0:13:22-0:13:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:13:22):**  to do, you know, ways in which to stimulate it.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:13:25):**  But it's just not an environment that fosters it so much.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:13:28):**  And when you think about some of the things that happen in startups where you have an  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:13:32):**  entrepreneur going to a place like Monsanto might not be their top choice.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:13:37):**  So you have these entrepreneurs that can start little companies.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:13:40):**  And I think that's a great system for for starting these little ideas, seeding these  
**[0:13:46-0:13:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:13:46):**  ideas, seeding the technology, de-risking it, and then it makes sense to bring it internally.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:13:53):**  You know, when we bought Climate Corporation, I mean, my feeling is that you think of the  
**[0:13:57-0:14:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:13:57):**  people that in Silicon Valley who started amazing, you know, AI folks who built a really  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:04):**  interesting platform that could be applied to agriculture and weather prediction.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:07):**  Oh, my gosh.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:08):**  You know, very challenging.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:09):**  Right.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:10):**  And in some ways, Monsanto bought it as a whole capability, a whole group of massively  
**[0:14:17-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:17):**  talented people and brought it into the company.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:20):**  And the same for John Deere.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:22):**  I think when they bought Blue River, you bought vision experts, sensor experts, and immediately  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:28):**  have a group, a solid group that's used to working together.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:32):**  That's a bolt on and can grow within your environment.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:38):**  There's no silver bullet formula for innovation in or outside of corporates.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:42):**  But as the ag tech ecosystem has evolved since the climate acquisition back in 2013, we've  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:47):**  seen various models with different levels of efficacy.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:50):**  This is true for research organizations, too.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:53):**  Nancy and her two co-founders were in fact all scientists at CSIRO and worked together  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:57):**  for years.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:14:58):**  But science is very different than commercialization.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:01):**  Yes.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:02):**  So we spun out of CSIRO.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:06):**  There were challenges, you know, even though the organization has really been promoting  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:10):**  scientists to have impact with their science and there have been programs set up to try  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:16):**  to encourage that.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:18):**  There really aren't a lot of scientists that then put their hands up and say, we're going  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:21):**  to do this.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:22):**  And so any time an organization is going through changes, I don't think they really knew what  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:28):**  to do with us when we said we're going to do this.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:30):**  We're going to form our own company.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:32):**  We didn't move into a government spin out.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:34):**  We wanted to form our own company.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:36):**  And we then license, worked to license our technology that we invented while we were  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:40):**  in CSIRO.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:41):**  So CSIRO is a shareholder.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:43):**  And we really wanted to form our own company because everything we had heard was that investors  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:48):**  aren't as positive about investing in the government spin up because by necessity, government  
**[0:15:54-0:16:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:15:54):**  has to be cautious and conservative, which means that they move more slowly.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:16:01):**  And so raising in venture and raising investment when your government spin up, everything we  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:16:06):**  heard was that it's almost impossible.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:16:08):**  And so we were highly motivated to make our company successful and to grow.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:16:13):**  And so we formed our own company.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:16:14):**  We licensed our technology.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:16:16):**  And then we did the best we could to get that first raise from main sequence.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:16:21):**  So those guys really supported us and backed us and that helped us also exit CSIRO.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:16:27):**  And so that was a critical piece in getting us out the door and getting us started.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:16:33):**  And then we had a good, probably, I'd say 16, almost 18 months before we were fully  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:16:40):**  commercial and ready to go.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:16:43):**  So we were three people for quite a long time.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:16:45):**  What was that like?  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:16:46):**  The kind of difference between being in a lab with lots of resources and the world you'd  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:16:51):**  been in that you were familiar with to, I imagine, a pretty different day to day operating

**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:16:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:16:57):**  So we moved into what some would characterize as a hovel in the middle of the valley.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:17:01):**  And in fact, you couldn't actually make a cup of coffee and boil the kettle at the same  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:17:06):**  time without blowing a fuse.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:17:08):**  But yeah, those were our humble beginnings.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:17:11):**  And it had little stickers all over it said, don't drill into the wall because of asbestos.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:17:14):**  So I'm sure it's earmarked to be demolished anytime soon.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:17:19):**  When you think about it, that's a big change for an internationally esteemed researcher.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:17:23):**  Nancy admits that changing her professional identity wasn't easy.

**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:17:33):**  had to stop becoming one thing before I could start becoming something else.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:17:37):**  So going through that process of stop becoming a no longer being a globally recognized research  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:17:43):**  scientist, no longer basically carrying out those duties and expectations of reviewing  
**[0:17:49-0:17:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:17:49):**  manuscripts of giving talks of supervising students and leaving that part of myself behind  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:17:57):**  to then take my scientific skills and translate them over to actually taking a product to  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:18:02):**  market that I think can have real world impact and change.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:18:06):**  And that was quite a massive transition and quite difficult, but I think it's absolutely  
**[0:18:11-0:18:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:18:11):**  necessary.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:18:12):**  I imagine that was really challenging.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:18:15):**  Was it also scary, like all the risks that come with or are perceived to come with starting  
**[0:18:20-0:18:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:18:20):**  a startup?  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:18:22):**  It's personally challenging for your ego.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:18:25):**  I had a profile and was recognized and got lots of invitations to go do fun and important  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:18:30):**  things.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:18:31):**  And I had to spend a good year and a half declining all of those invitations and divesting  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:18:36):**  all of my research to others.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:18:38):**  So personally, I had to make the choice to no longer be known.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:18:42):**  And then I go into the startup world and the business world where I certainly have no recognition  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:18:49):**  or profile, but I also in terms of business skills have no skills there.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:18:53):**  So I had to surround myself with mentors and people who were really savvy business people  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:18:58):**  to help us make this transition, give us credibility and start to take our product to market.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:19:03):**  So yeah, a massive both personally and professionally, but well worth it.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:19:08):**  I have zero regret from taking this opportunity and not to suggest it's not challenging, it's  
**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:19:13):**  challenging every single day, but it's also an amazing opportunity and super exciting.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:19:19):**  These days, scientists are viewing commercialization and in particular the venture backed startup  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:19:23):**  model as an increasingly viable option for their innovations.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:19:27):**  Jacqueline says she's witnessed this shift over the course of her career, driven in part  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:19:32):**  by two key technological changes in the past decade that have really opened the door for  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:19:37):**  science based startups, particularly in ag inputs.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:19:41):**  And one of them is of course data access and AI, machine learning, data availability, visualization.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:19:49):**  And the other is really is the low cost of sequencing, which has really enabled synthetic  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:19:54):**  biology and so reading, writing genetic code has been incredibly influential.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:19:59):**  And so Enco utilizes DNA encoded libraries, which is really, it's just an incremental  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:20:07):**  innovation to combinatorial chemistry, which failed miserably for crop health and for pharma,  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:20:14):**  but being able to deconvolute by being able to encode information in a DNA barcode attached  
**[0:20:20-0:20:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:20:20):**  to a molecule changed the game.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:20:23):**  And so this was something that was starting to be de-risked in the pharmaceutical space.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:20:29):**  And when we looked at one of the most important issues in agriculture today, crop health is  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:20:35):**  incredibly important, right?  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:20:37):**  You could lose up to 40% of your crops with global climate change.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:20:41):**  The types of pests are going to be changing very quickly.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:20:44):**  So we know we need to be agile, right?  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:20:46):**  And we need to come up with solutions yesterday.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:20:48):**  I mean, there are things on farm today that absolutely need to be solved like resistance  
**[0:20:54-0:20:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:20:54):**  to glyphosate and to herbicides.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:20:57):**  So seeing crop protection as key to sustainability, right?  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:21:03):**  To sustainable agriculture systems, and then saying, how can we overlay technology that's  
**[0:21:08-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:21:08):**  not being applied today with the technology from pharmaceuticals like DNA encoded libraries,  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:21:15):**  machine learning approaches.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:21:16):**  It seemed like it was just a very natural and incredibly important step to take.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:21:23):**  I mean, you think about that technology and it got around some of the barriers to entry  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:21:27):**  that exist in the crop protection space today, you know, in terms of needing huge infrastructure  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:21:33):**  in a proprietary library.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:21:35):**  Now you don't.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:21:36):**  And so we can approach it very differently.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:21:39):**  And that's where the idea for ANCO was born.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:21:41):**  The company uses data-driven experimentation to tune chemical properties and create crop  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:21:46):**  protection products.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:21:47):**  And it's the evolution of DNA encoded libraries and machine learning approaches that has meant  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:21:52):**  that the barriers to entry for discovery are much lower.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:21:55):**  Even startups have access to technologies that can speed up the science.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:21:59):**  Yeah, so the way that it is that it previously has worked is that you'd start with a very  
**[0:22:06-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:22:06):**  large library of molecules and you take a single molecule at a time and you'd screen  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:22:13):**  it against a pest and see if it actually controlled the pest that you are interested in.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:22:19):**  And so in order to screen enough molecules to find something that actually works, it's  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:22:25):**  a massive exercise, right?  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:22:27):**  So it requires a large infrastructure of robotics, automated screening and things like that,  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:22:33):**  as well as a proprietary library.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:22:35):**  So these are libraries that have been built up over years and years.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:22:39):**  And so it's really a very prized possession of the R&D majors.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:22:44):**  And so that sort of kept, that was the way it had worked.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:22:48):**  And so it really was sort of a difficult thing to replicate in a small company.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:22:53):**  When you talk about the, so it's not only the library and the computational power, but  
**[0:22:58-0:23:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:22:58):**  that process of actually saying, okay, does it work?  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:00):**  You've got to have like a wet lab or you've got to have facilities where you test it in  
**[0:23:04-0:23:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:04):**  a crop.

**[0:23:07-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:07):**  are like, does it control the pest and it's like, well, what does that mean?  
**[0:23:09-0:23:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:09):**  Do you, are you pipetting something on a leaf?  
**[0:23:11-0:23:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:11):**  Are you, you know, like how does it work?  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:13):**  Yeah, you're spraying, you're spraying an individual molecule on a pest.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:17):**  So say, you know, a weed, Palmer pigweed or something, you're spraying it on and you ask  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:22):**  the question, does it control it or kill it or, or does it not?  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:26):**  And then if it does, that's just, that's just the beginning, right?  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:30):**  Because it certainly doesn't do it in a way that is, you know, where you've proven that  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:34):**  it's safe or that it could be applied outside or it's, it controls it in a fashion, you  
**[0:23:40-0:23:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:40):**  know, out in the environment.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:41):**  And so you have to do what's called optimization.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:43):**  So you take that seed molecule that you think is an interesting starting point, and then  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:48):**  you start creating variation around it.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:51):**  And when you create that variation, then you test all those variations to see if you've  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:55):**  made an improvement.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:23:57):**  And one of the issues with the system is that you're making variations sort of blind because  
**[0:24:03-0:24:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:03):**  you don't know what the target is that you've hit.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:06):**  In contrast, what Enco does, we know the target and we design things for that target, knowing  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:12):**  that that target has proven to be useful in an agriculture setting against a particular  
**[0:24:18-0:24:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:18):**  pest.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:19):**  So if I, let me say that back to you and you tell me if I got it right.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:22):**  So the traditional model would have been, let's try to kind of see what's out there,  
**[0:24:26-0:24:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:26):**  like have this big library.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:27):**  And then there's sort of a matching process of like, we have this molecule, does it work?  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:31):**  Does it work on this?  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:32):**  How does it work?  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:33):**  And then what happens?  
**[0:24:34-0:24:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:34):**  And then, you know, if there's a good sign, we kind of take it from there.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:36):**  Whereas you're saying, let's start from the other side and say, we know what we want to  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:39):**  target.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:40):**  We want to manage this pest or we want to control this disease and then let's actually  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:44):**  make the molecule or let's go find it.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:46):**  What happens next?  
**[0:24:47-0:24:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:47):**  How do you kind of work backwards?  
**[0:24:48-0:24:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:49):**  So we, yeah, so exactly.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:50):**  So we say, okay, we look at all of the targets in pests that could be used to kill a pest.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:24:57):**  So it's an essential protein in a pest of interest.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:01):**  And we know that if we can inhibit it, stop it from working, that we would actually be  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:05):**  able to kill the pest in the environment.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:07):**  And so we start there.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:08):**  Then we ask the question, is this target found in other places?  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:13):**  And do we have the opportunity to make sure that we don't get off target effects?  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:18):**  So we don't affect species that we don't want to have a negative impact on.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:23):**  And so we put it through those filters and then we say, okay, this is a great, this is  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:26):**  a great target for us.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:27):**  We can make something safe.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:29):**  It's going to be a differentiated product on the market.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:32):**  And then we go and we screen a library.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:34):**  And so with our partner, we screen a DNA encoded library.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:38):**  It has 140 billion compounds.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:41):**  The typical Ag library would have maybe something in the single digit millions of compounds  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:47):**  that they will screen one at a time.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:49):**  If you tried to do that method with 140 billion compounds, I think you'd be at it for about,  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:25:54):**  you know, a hundred years trying to actually survey all of this diversity.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:26:00):**  And so, but in our case, you take this target, it's sort of in solution.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:26:05):**  So a very highly purified protein, and you just stick it in a soup that has 140 billion  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:26:12):**  compounds, each with an individual barcode that tells you what it is.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:26:16):**  And you look for things that stick that bind to it, because if it binds, then maybe it  
**[0:26:21-0:26:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:26:21):**  can stop its activity.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:26:23):**  Then what you do is you just cleave off the DNA, wash away everything that's not sticking,  
**[0:26:29-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:26:29):**  and you sequence.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:26:30):**  You do it.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:26:31):**  And this is where it gets back to the technology that's really had a huge impact in the last  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:26:35):**  two decades is you deep sequence and then you get counts.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:26:39):**  You say, well, how often did I see this particular molecule bind to the target of interest?  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:26:45):**  And then you're off to the races.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:26:46):**  Now you have a starting point and you can visualize how that starting point actually  
**[0:26:52-0:26:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:26:52):**  binds into the pocket of the enzyme.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:26:55):**  And so you can make it better.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:26:58):**  Pharmaceutical companies have used that approach because they have targets that they know are  
**[0:27:04-0:27:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:27:04):**  useful for certain disease types.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:27:06):**  But this innovation is very new to the pharmaceutical sector as well, but it has been using it.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:27:13):**  And the beautiful thing about it is not only does it give you these new starting points,  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:27:17):**  but it gives you a whole data set that's amenable to using AI and machine learning and modeling  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:27:22):**  to improve the way you progress it to the final commercial product.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:27:28):**  So beyond the very exciting combo of science and technology, how do these crop protection  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:27:32):**  discoveries actually land in the hands of growers?  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:27:35):**  Enco has only been around for four years and its products aren't yet being sold to farmers.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:27:39):**  But Enco, which is backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, among others, plans  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:27:43):**  to establish itself as a platform for developing multiple new products.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:27:48):**  So you start to evaluate a combination of not just how well it works on the science  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:27:55):**  side and controlling of pests, but then you start combining that with the market potential  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:28:01):**  for it.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:28:02):**  So things like controlling glyphosate resistant polymer pigweed is a huge market because it's

**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:28:13):**  I mean, you're starting to talk about a very large market need.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:28:18):**  And the crop protection market is about a 60 billion dollar market today.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:28:23):**  And so there's lots of opportunity for differentiation.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:28:26):**  We've been talking a little bit about biologicals and I guess a lot of the companies are like  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:28:31):**  a product company as in we've discovered this kind of bacteria or we've discovered this,  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:28:36):**  you know, something in the kind of product space.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:28:38):**  But you guys are more about this process or can you just clarify like what part does Enco  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:28:43):**  actually kind of own or what's the secret sauce that you guys do versus more of the  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:28:47):**  kind of basic science?  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:28:48):**  Yeah, so we want we actually we want to be a product company too, but we have a pipeline  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:28:54):**  so we'll have multiple products.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:28:55):**  So we have if we talk about a target as a single thing that could produce, you know,  
**[0:29:00-0:29:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:00):**  studying one target could produce several products from that.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:03):**  We hope to have a pipeline that's continuously creating products for the market in different  
**[0:29:09-0:29:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:09):**  segments.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:11):**  In Nancy's experience, the science can be complex, but the solutions have to be simple  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:16):**  to fit into existing farming systems.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:18):**  This has meant pivoting not just the technology, but also Rapid AIM's idea of who the customer  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:23):**  actually is.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:25):**  It's changed substantially.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:26):**  In fact, one of our first pivots was on our technology.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:30):**  And I would say a second big pivot has been around our go to market.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:34):**  So the first one was when we first did an accelerator program, our technology was camera  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:38):**  based technology.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:39):**  It was a way to patent on taking high quality, low power images of insects entering a trap.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:46):**  But when we got out of the building and really started to talk with end users, nobody wanted  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:51):**  pictures of insects.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:52):**  They just want to know whether they were there.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:54):**  So we really pivoted our technology to come up with what we use today, which is an ultra  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:29:58):**  low power capacitance type sensing.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:30:00):**  You know, it allows for very too small lithium ion batteries to last for 18 months.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:30:05):**  So super low maintenance.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:30:06):**  So that was a key pivot technology wise.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:30:09):**  The key pivot for our go to market strategy is, of course, our first end users and customers  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:30:15):**  we thought were growers.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:30:17):**  And that has been valuable in terms of demonstrating the value of our products.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:30:22):**  So now we have over 500 sensors deployed across Australia, 170 end users.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:30:27):**  So we understand the quality and reliability of our product.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:30:29):**  But most importantly, we understand how it's being used and the value.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:30:33):**  But now really our customer is most likely will be and groups that we're working with  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:30:40):**  at the moment will be crop protection companies.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:30:44):**  So it opens the doors for biologicals and biopesticides.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:30:48):**  But most importantly, what growers say they like about it is it proves whether control  
**[0:30:52-0:30:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:30:52):**  was working and where it's working.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:30:55):**  So we've had a massive pivot, massive change to who our actual customers are likely to  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:00):**  be.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:01):**  Yeah, well, the classic startup journey, I was looking at stats the other day that said,  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:05):**  when startups take the kind of scientific method approach of startups and do that work  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:10):**  to get out and understand customers and change and pivot, they're like 50 percent more likely  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:14):**  to pivot and also something like 10 times more likely to raise money and succeed when  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:19):**  they have that listen to customers change and adapt approach.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:23):**  So there's good science behind that methodology as well.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:25):**  I'm really interested in the point you just made around trust and kind of certainty from  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:29):**  growers like in talking to customers and in talking to them about their pest management  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:34):**  strategies.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:35):**  What have you learned about how to get trust and ultimately kind of adoption from farmers?  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:40):**  Because we talk about how important trust is in agriculture.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:43):**  What's your observations been?  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:45):**  Yeah, it's fascinating.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:48):**  I'll first talk about it just from the perspective of technology creators.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:52):**  We have highly skilled, highly technical people in the company.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:55):**  It's all incredibly capable.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:31:58):**  It's both a good thing and a bad thing.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:32:00):**  The great thing about it is that we have made something amazing that can really have huge  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:32:04):**  impact and change the way that pests are managed.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:32:07):**  The bad thing is when you have highly skilled and highly talented people, they often don't  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:32:13):**  need to leave the room to create something amazing.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:32:16):**  Now the problem with that is, is it useful?  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:32:21):**  Just because we can doesn't mean we should.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:32:23):**  So getting out and talking to customers, understanding their pain points, putting our technology  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:32:30):**  in their hands is absolutely critical.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:32:35):**  Really listening to them when they say whether they need something to solve a problem or  
**[0:32:41-0:32:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:32:41):**  not.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:32:42):**  So I think it really boils down to just because we can doesn't mean we should.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:32:45):**  And we have a strategy right now where we know to break down barriers to market entry,  
**[0:32:50-0:32:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:32:50):**  one of the things is start to be able to detect other key pests with our same piece of hardware.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:32:57):**  And so our first application domain has been fruit fly, but they also want it for things  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:33:02):**  like cotling moth and light brown apple moth, which are pests of fruit and vines because  
**[0:33:08-0:33:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:33:08):**  they don't want to increase their cost of pest management.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:33:10):**  They don't want to also pay for somebody to go around and check those traps.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:33:14):**  They want it all in one.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:33:16):**  The other focus is pest forecast.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:33:18):**  They always want to know what's happening in the region and when is there likely to  
**[0:33:22-0:33:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:33:22):**  be a big problem.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:33:23):**  So we're also adding value to our current real time data flow by generating pest forecasts.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:33:29):**  And that's because our customers said, if only they had that piece of information, here's

**[0:33:35-0:33:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:33:35):**  They would be able to plan better.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:33:37):**  They would be able to organize their workflow on their farms better.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:33:41):**  That's kind of where I wanted to go, Nancy, was the like we talk about technology is useful,  
**[0:33:46-0:33:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:33:46):**  but just like you said, just because you can build it doesn't mean you should.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:33:49):**  And it has to actually create a new decision or add some kind of value for the farmer to  
**[0:33:54-0:33:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:33:54):**  help them change practices.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:33:56):**  We kind of came at this whole opportunity area from looking at biologicals and some  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:34:00):**  of the challenges around biologicals and different forms of agroecological approaches.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:34:05):**  What are you seeing in terms of just rapid aim so far enable other kinds of pest control  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:34:11):**  or more biologicals or overcome some of the challenges of biologicals for some of your

**[0:34:16-0:34:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:34:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:34:17):**  So two parts on that, Sarah.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:34:19):**  The first part is traditionally the way in which we manage pests, which are highly mobile,  
**[0:34:25-0:34:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:34:25):**  right?  
**[0:34:26-0:34:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:34:26):**  They're moving around all the time.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:34:27):**  They don't recognize an orchard or farm or state border.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:34:32):**  However, the way in which we manage them is that we just take action and control at the  
**[0:34:38-0:34:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:34:38):**  scale of a field, maybe a farm.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:34:41):**  And so the insect pest happily moves around.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:34:43):**  And that's why we continue to kind of chase our tail with pest management.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:34:47):**  So this is important that we start to align the scale at which we create information and  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:34:53):**  the scale at which we control and manage the problem.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:34:57):**  This becomes really important for biologicals because a lot of biologicals require early  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:35:03):**  detection and early control.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:35:06):**  So for example, there's some exciting new mating disruption technology that's sprayable.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:35:11):**  So mating disruption technology, what it does is it confuses the male moths as an example  
**[0:35:18-0:35:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:35:18):**  so that they're not able to find female moths to actually mate.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:35:24):**  So then it causes population suppression.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:35:27):**  However, if a farmer applies this mating disruption technology on a field, nothing stops an already  
**[0:35:34-0:35:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:35:34):**  mated female from coming in from next door and laying her eggs on a corn crop and causing  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:35:40):**  damage.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:35:41):**  So it's critical that it is used early and at scale.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:35:46):**  So not just one farm, but the farm and their neighbors and even understanding across a  
**[0:35:51-0:35:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:35:51):**  region.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:35:52):**  A second example would probably be from some of the viruses that work against insects.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:35:57):**  They need to be applied at a very specific timing, at a very specific stage of the insect.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:36:04):**  And also they break down so quickly with UV degradation.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:36:08):**  So timing is everything.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:36:11):**  In addition to listening to customers and getting the business model right, startups  
**[0:36:14-0:36:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:36:14):**  have to attract the capital they need to grow.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:36:17):**  Jacqueline says venture capital, while not a perfect system, is essential in tackling  
**[0:36:21-0:36:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:36:21):**  some of the big problems in ag.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:36:24):**  So I'm trying to picture a world where when I started as an entrepreneur and there was  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:36:28):**  absolutely no capital being allocated in agriculture, where would we be today if we didn't have  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:36:34):**  this uptick in venture funding?  
**[0:36:37-0:36:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:36:37):**  So it's absolutely essential.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:36:39):**  Now, I think a lot of people complain or the biggest complaint about venture funding is  
**[0:36:46-0:36:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:36:46):**  that there's a fund lifecycle and really to build something big and sustainable takes  
**[0:36:53-0:36:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:36:53):**  time.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:36:54):**  And so if and probably almost certainly before the five year or seven year investment cycle  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:37:00):**  that a VC would like to invest and then get an exit.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:37:03):**  And so I think that's where the disconnect is.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:37:07):**  And I think with ag, it's going to be interesting to watch and see how it all plays out.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:37:11):**  So you think of it as an ecosystem that you have to develop.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:37:15):**  Now, I think we're I'd say ag is firmly mature in its early stage investor community.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:37:22):**  And so I think that that's great.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:37:25):**  But when it comes to the transition to a growth stage, that's where I think we need to continue  
**[0:37:30-0:37:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:37:30):**  to have larger biotech funds or banks or pension funds that are really interested in looking  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:37:38):**  at this sector because of its importance for global climate change, sustainability and  
**[0:37:42-0:37:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:37:42):**  all of it, and really move us into that next era of having a much more mature funnel into  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:37:49):**  the public markets or to very sustainable businesses that have started from the ground  
**[0:37:55-0:37:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:37:55):**  up, which is interesting.  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:37:57):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:37:58):**  Obviously, I believe in venture capital as a partner.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:38:01):**  I wouldn't be a VC otherwise, but it's not the one model that works and you do need other  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:38:07):**  people on that journey.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:38:08):**  So I agree with you there.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:38:10):**  What advice would you have for kind of going back to your background for a researcher or  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:38:15):**  someone who's kind of more on the science side and wants to get into the entrepreneurship  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:38:19):**  or venture capital world?  
**[0:38:23-0:38:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:38:23):**  I think it's a fabulous path because so much of what you do in venture is evaluate technology.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:38:31):**  And so my recommendation of somebody, I think getting some concrete experience in a startup  
**[0:38:38-0:38:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:38:38):**  is really helpful, maybe even in a larger company.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:38:41):**  But having that sort of operational experience is really helpful so that when you are on  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:38:48):**  the board or when you are making an evaluation for an investment, you kind of know some of  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:38:53):**  the things that are important and what to look for because I think it's harder to do  
**[0:38:58-0:39:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:38:58):**  it just by the book.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:39:01):**  I asked Nancy the same question.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:39:03):**  What advice she has for any researchers looking to make the leap to entrepreneurship?  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:39:08):**  I guess sometimes I meet colleagues who are trying to do a little bit of both.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:39:13):**  They're still trying to do their research while thinking about commercializing the technology  
**[0:39:17-0:39:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:39:17):**  because I'm asked that too.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:39:18):**  Why didn't you just stay at CSIRO and do this as well?  
**[0:39:22-0:39:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:39:22):**  Focus is critical because the only thing we really have as a startup is speed.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/14/biologicals-finding-ways-to-commercialize-the-science#t=0:39:29):**  And focus and being both developing our technology, implementing our technology, taking it to

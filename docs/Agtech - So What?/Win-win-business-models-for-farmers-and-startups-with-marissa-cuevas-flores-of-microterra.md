### Agtech - So What?  (2022-01-09)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the AgTenta Group.  I'm Sarah Nolet.  A lot of people are drawn to AgTech because they want to change the world.  And with the challenges that Ag is facing globally, from food security and nutrition  to environmental impact and economic development, it just feels like there's got to be a way  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:00:21):**  for anyone to contribute, whatever their skills or background might be.  But going from passion to big idea to tech that actually makes sense, especially to farmers,  can be a difficult journey.  And taking the final step from tech that makes sense to a thriving company is even harder.  As you can imagine, no farmer wanted to buy our technology first because it wasn't mature  
**[0:00:42-0:00:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:00:42):**  enough.  Second, because it was like, I'm already at so much risk, and I'm already taking all these  high operational costs and having low margins, etc.  So why would I be interested in that?  That's Marissa Cuevas.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:00:57):**  She's a Mexico City-based cereal entrepreneur and the founder of Microterra, a company that's  threading the needle on farm profitability, growing and selling plant protein, and cleaning  water.  The story of how those seemingly unrelated goals came together is kind of extraordinary.  It took Marissa from an early career in waste management to an awakening about the importance  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:01:17):**  of water and the possibilities of biology, and through a process of better understanding  the ag marketplace.  It would also take a global pandemic and a beachside jolt of inspiration to get Marissa  and Microterra to where they are today, paying farmers to grow plant protein on existing  ponds and reducing water pollution at the same time.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:01:36):**  Marissa's winding path to ag tech has played a big role in the challenges and solutions  she's interested in.  That path didn't start on a farm, but in a lab studying renewable energy and waste management  in Germany, learning skills and strategies that she was excited to bring home to Mexico.  I started to work for the German Corporation Agency in renewable energies, but I had a  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:01:57):**  side job, which was to recycle styrofoam waste.  Because I was so fascinated by waste, and in Mexico we use a lot of styrofoam for takeout.  I couldn't deal with the fact that so much styrofoam was being sent to the landfill,  and it was using all of the volume, even though it's very little plastic, right?  Since I had access to a lab, I started to work on a formula to upcycle the styrofoam,  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:02:23):**  and so we transformed it into wood varnish and coatings.  And all of the sudden it became bigger and bigger, and I decided to quit my job and to  launch a startup.  This was 2014.  It was a side project, and I had a parallelly formal job, and then at some point it was  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:02:42):**  like, okay, let's do it.  What was that like to quit your job and decide to start this company?  I think I was, to be brutally honest, I didn't think I'm going to become an entrepreneur  or a zero entrepreneur or anything like that.  It was just like, I'm going to do this side project that makes so much fun in the meantime  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:03:02):**  while I get to my masters.  I thought of it at the beginning as a project and then something you do in between other  projects and then all of a sudden it became so big that I spent two years doing it full  time and with a team and everything.  So yeah, no, I didn't realize I'm going to become an entrepreneur.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:03:22):**  It was more like step by step and all of a sudden it was like, wow, it turns out I'm  an entrepreneur now.  I love that.  The accidental entrepreneur.  Okay, so you were building that business for two years and then what happened?  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:03:35):**  So the fascinating part was that people were very curious about like, wow, styrofoam can  be recycled.  So they were very supportive.  The hard part was that I wasn't good at selling and I didn't spend a lot of time selling.  And of course that was very challenging for the business.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:03:52):**  You can probably hear a bit of feedback in Marissa's audio here.  Her office is near a bustling recycled metals market, one of the more on-brand disruptions  I've come across.  At some point I had to have two other jobs to sustain my team.  And so I was consulting for international development agencies and yeah, doing a lot  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:04:11):**  of consulting work.  And as you can imagine, after a while, I was so tired and I realized, no, this is not sustainable.  I need to take a break.  And so I decided to shut the start down and move to New York for a master's degree.  What was that like?  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:04:27):**  It must've been really hard to decide, okay, we have to give this up and there's people  and jobs.  And what was that like deciding to make that change?  It was really hard.  I learned so much from that.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:04:37):**  So first it was a personal decision when I was like, I really cannot do this any longer.  Like I'm exhausted.  And then pulling through and telling your entire team and getting rid of the materials  and the infrastructure and stuff.  The hardest part without a doubt was because they were really mission driven and they were  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:04:53):**  there because of the cause and they were following me ultimately.  And at some point it was like, I really cannot do this any longer.  So it was hard.  And the second part was the public because people were really fond of the idea and it  was more a B2C business.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:05:08):**  And also we required the styrofoam from people.  So it was really, really people driven.  We had done a crowdfunding campaign, et cetera.  So that was like hard to tell them like, okay, we're stopping this and trying to find a way  in which I was comfortable with.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:05:23):**  And so what we did, we exported sort of the IP or the project to my father's company so  that he could keep on recycling styrofoam, but he would use the varnish instead of selling  it.  So try to, you know, like make peace with that.  And yes, then deciding where all the varnish and coatings were going to go and yeah, closing  
**[0:05:42-0:05:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:05:42):**  that chapter.  Oh, wow.  That's really tough.  You probably in hindsight, like it's a couple of sentences that you say, but like, I'm sure  in the moment it was lots of emotions and people.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:05:51):**  So thank you for sharing that.  So you went to New York, what were you studying there and what was your kind of hope that  you would do next?  I went to study sustainability management at the earth Institute from Columbia university.  So I was really excited.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:06:07):**  Their Institute aims to bring academia and projects in outside the academia together.  And yeah, I was fascinated by the idea.  I moved there.  It was like fresh, new beginning like fresh energy, et cetera.  But all of this, to be quite honest, it was quite hard to become a student again, because  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:06:24):**  when you're an entrepreneur, you're used to, you had the light shine on you and you're  making all the decisions, et cetera, and all of this.  And I was just a student and for all the things that I was working hard to, for example, for  a paper or whatever, for me, it was super demotivating to know it's going to land on  somebody's desk and that's it.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:06:46):**  And this could be a project or these hours could be, have been used for something in  the real world.  So that was a challenge.  But Marisa's return to study would also lead her to a new venture that would become Microterra.  She remembers the two key talks that inspired her.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:07:03):**  In that first summer, I was invited to go to Singularity University.  Back then it was at NASA Ames.  They bring 90 people together from, that year was 42 different countries.  And then you are there with these people, 90 days or like three months, just speaking  all the time about these exponential technologies.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:07:26):**  I just came from a master's degree.  I knew that water was in the bottom of my heart, but I didn't know exactly how, but  it was like a lab to me in like paradise.  Like I knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur.  I knew that from my first company.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:07:39):**  And so to be there all of the sudden and be like, okay, now you can choose about what  to be an entrepreneur was really a privileged situation.  It was mind blowing, right?  For someone like me who had a technical background and all of the sudden you're sitting there  talking about artificial intelligence and how fast is it going to come.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:07:58):**  And I remember every lecture was like, wow, this was mind blowing.  So it was really hard to pick at the beginning.  What is it going to be my next thing?  But all of the sudden it came together.  And so I remember there were two lectures who really caught me.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:08:12):**  One was from a representative from the UN together with that person from the Stockholm  Brazilian center.  And so they were talking about like the planetary boundaries and the challenges as a humanity.  And they mentioned the next world war is going to be about water.  And I grew up in Mexico city.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:08:33):**  So water crisis was always in our headlines.  And so as soon as I heard that, I was like, wow, how, you know, like that is something  big.  How can we even deal with that fact or that, that forecast and continue with our lives?  And so I decided for me, it was like, for as much as I don't like it, we can live in  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:08:51):**  a world with full of waste, but we cannot live in a world without water.  So the priorities change.  And I was like, okay, water, I want to spend my career trying to make a difference there.  And so the second one was about synthetic biology.  And I remember that workshop, the really fascinating thought or principle was we can use living  
**[0:09:14-0:09:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:09:14):**  organisms to heal the planet or to clean water or to regenerate soil, to capture carbon,  to whatever you want.  And that's when it really becomes interesting because it then becomes exponential by having  living organs.  And so there were the two pieces that I wanted to work with.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:09:32):**  Like I wanted to work in topics about water with biology as a tool to solve it.  You mentioned growing up in Mexico city and water being front of mind for people who maybe  aren't familiar with that.  Tell me a little bit more about the kind of water situation in Mexico city.  So Mexico city is a valley between among mountains, right?  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:09:54):**  So it used to be a lake about 1,500 years ago.  And as you can imagine, it's really hard to put water out of the mountains and to put  water in.  So we have a huge aquifer that we use to, yeah, to give the entire city water.  The problem with that aquifer is that it's growing.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:10:14):**  And every time we pump water out, it's like a sponge.  So the soil is actually sinking.  And that is crazy.  I think it sinks about a meter every 10 years, which is a lot.  And so that creates other sort of challenges, right?  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:10:33):**  Because it breaks the pipeline infrastructure.  So I think 40% of the water in Mexico is wasted through leakages.  It's an astonishing high number, but actually the rest of the world isn't that less.  So we lose a lot of water through leakages in general.  So that is basically the challenge, right?  
**[0:10:52-0:10:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:10:52):**  Like how do you provide 20 million people or 25 million people with water when you are  in such a geography?  And then what is the right way to do it?  And what you will find on the periphery is that they are not connected to the grid, to  the water grid.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:11:09):**  So the water is provided by pipes, so like trucks and with water.  And that is the most expensive water that you can get everywhere in the world, as you  can imagine.  And I thought like, this is so unfair because it's the poorest people that are paying for  the highest price of water.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:11:29):**  That's a crazy challenge.  And just for perspective, like all of Australia has 25 million people, like in the whole country,  which is the size of the US.  So one city with that many people, I think is just mind blowing to get our heads around.  So you're sitting there with these two ideas, water and synthetic biology.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:11:43):**  And then you again decided to start a company.  Is that what happened next?  And what were the early days of the company journey like?  Sure.  At first I needed to find an idea, right?  
**[0:11:54-0:11:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:11:54):**  Like a solution.  And then I started the company.  So this solution came by thinking about, okay, it's not really about how much water do we  have in the system because as water is a renewable resource, but it's rather what we do with  the wastewater that I believe there is a huge opportunity.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:12:10):**  And so I started to look at wastewater with this mindset of like circular economy, how  do we transform waste into resources, et cetera.  And what came out first was the link between water and agriculture.  Like 70% of the world's fresh water goes into agriculture.  So if you want to move the needle, that's what we need to change.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:12:29):**  Because ultimately, even though I was impacted by like the urban water crisis, actually that's  I think less than 10%.  So it won't move the needle.  It will affect a lot of people and a lot of lives, but it won't solve the problem ultimately.  So I started to look at the interconnection between water and agriculture and the wastewater  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:12:48):**  coming out of it.  And it turns out it's always nitrogen and phosphorus coming from two main sources, fertilizer  runoff and animal manure.  And that when it washes off, it goes to the rivers and lakes and ultimately the ocean.  So I knew, okay, there is this one problem that is affecting one thing, but then it ripples  
**[0:13:07-0:13:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:13:07):**  to many systems.  And if we can solve it at the source, we would have a huge impact, right?  Pretty soon I realized like nitrogen and phosphorus are also the key components of our food security.  So that was the genesis of microtherapy, but also this moment where, when it didn't make  sense, like how can it be that the biggest challenge for us as a humankind, like the  
**[0:13:28-0:13:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:13:28):**  water crisis, the World War III, et cetera, can be interrelated to the pillar of our food  security.  And so the answer was pretty clear.  Let's put these two together and try to upcycle the nutrients from the wastewater to produce  more food.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:13:42):**  And in that way to clean water and produce food.  So one of the challenges that we see with a lot of entrepreneurs who come into this  space wanting to solve like a societal problem, like something around preventing World War  III and upcycling nutrients, one of the challenges is, okay, who pays for it?  Who are the customers?  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:13:59):**  What's the actual business?  Because it's one thing to have this big vision and mission, but like, how do you actually  make money?  How did you think about that challenge?  Well, at the beginning, I thought a bit very wrong.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:14:09):**  I was very incorrectly.  And so the first idea was to develop a water treatment system with microalgae, microalgae  being the fastest biomass on earth.  And I thought, okay, perfect.  We have a lot of sunlight in Mexico, so we can just grow with agricultural wastewater,  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:14:26):**  microalgae, and then separate it.  And then we can use the microalgae for either animal feed or fertilizer.  And then the clean water can be reused.  We worked with that idea for about two years.  So I had the idea, I started to work on it, and then I decided to come back to Mexico  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:14:41):**  and try it.  I really believe that Mexico is like an amazing environment for entrepreneurs.  Like all the rules are flexible.  And so that is already the entrepreneurial mindset.  And so you can try out different things very fast and very cheap.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:14:59):**  So I decided to come back to Mexico.  I was awarded a couple of grants.  And so I started to work on that idea.  But as I mentioned, it was the wrong idea.  Because I was using the same analogy as renewable energies, right?  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:15:13):**  Like you have a high capex, but as you have no opex or operational cost, you can pay back  the technology with time.  But the challenge there is that you need a lot of financing.  And that is something that includes risk, includes cost, and where the technology has  to be proven.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:15:32):**  And so we were thinking wrongly about the idea first.  As you can imagine, no farmer wanted to buy our technology first because it wasn't mature  enough.  Second, because it was like, I'm already at so much risk.  And I'm already taking all these high operational costs and having low margins, et cetera.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:15:50):**  So why would I be interested on that?  And the other problem with that idea was that you cannot make a business by selling fertilizer  out of microalgae.  Because the cost of producing that, it's so much higher than the price that they will  pay for it, right?  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:16:09):**  And we tried to pivot and to do animal feed, fish feed, et cetera.  But it was so hard and we realized, no, farmers want to use what, for example, as fish feed,  what they have been using for the last 10 years or something that is validated.  They don't want to get to another risk situation.  They are already in a very risky situation.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:16:29):**  And we figured that out actually during the pandemic.  So the pandemic hit, we started to realize we're missing some parts.  So let's use this time to do a market sprint.  And we put the call to reach out to a hundred people.  And it was the beginning of the pandemic.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:16:45):**  So everyone was bored at home, taking cold calls and it was perfect.  But at the same time, it was really hard.  And this was my second hard experience where I realized, wow, I have been leading my team  to the wrong solution and we have been working so hard for it.  And now it turns out at that end.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:17:06):**  And so that was the first 50 interviews or more or less.  And so for the other ones, we were just like, okay, let's be brave and let's open up ourselves  to what is it that can work.  Instead of trying to push our idea and our solution there, let's just listen to what  it is.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:17:22):**  And it might be another technology that we then have to license or push or whatever.  So let's just hear what the public wants.  So we have three main outcomes.  Like first, farmers cannot pay for this.  As I mentioned, they have low margins, high risk, very high operational costs.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:17:40):**  So they shouldn't be the ones carrying the burden of sustainability that needed to change.  Then the second part is like the final product needs to be a high value product.  Otherwise you will never make a business out of it.  And then in between we realized after talking to a lot of alternative protein entrepreneurs  that if the solution wasn't scalable, you rather not try it out because feeding the  
**[0:18:05-0:18:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:18:05):**  world is quite a challenge.  And so it's not for a lab scale solution.  It has to be scalable from the beginning.  Like it has to be thought about with scalability in its bottom or in its heart.  We started to think about what industries are growing and where can we couple with them.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:18:25):**  We also started to think about different and more innovative business models.  And I still remember, so after that hundred interviews, we took a time off because as  you can imagine, we were like, wow, what are we going to do now?  And I thought there is no sense in trying to keep on working if we don't even know where  to.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:18:47):**  Let's save the runway and everyone can have one month off.  And during that month I went to the beach and I was sitting on an Airbnb and was thinking  like, this is so genius.  It's the win-win situation that we need in the ag space.  And we started to put all the pieces together and it was like, let's do something similar  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:19:06):**  with agriculture.  And so the question was like, how can we add more value to the farms?  That's ultimately what Airbnb is doing is you have an asset, but they are telling you,  you can make money out of that asset in a short term period.  And so we were thinking, okay, we started to see the fish ponds as huge bioreactors  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:19:26):**  with a lot of amazing things like sunlight, lots of water, of course, lots of nutrients.  And we saw that opportunity.  It's exactly what plants like.  And so we can actually pay for using that surface of the fish ponds.  And then we connected the second thought being let's use a dogweed or lemna instead of microalgae.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:19:48):**  Why?  Because the infrastructure for microalgae was so expensive and then rolling out that  technology, if you need a microscope to know if your culture is healthy or not, that's  going to have so many challenges to be adopted in the field.  We found lemna along the way and it was like, great.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:20:04):**  You can see with your eyes, you can harvest it with nets, very similar to fish.  And they're very resilient.  They have a very high duplication time, et cetera.  And the last part was lemna has a great value in the market.  Even more so if you put some food science behind it.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:20:21):**  And so we started to work on removing taste and color and experimenting with the functionality  with lemna as an ingredient.  And there it was like, okay, finally we made it like a high value product with low cost  of production, with taking the fish farmers into account and creating a win-win situation.  Tell me what is lemna?  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:20:43):**  It's a plant or it's a bacteria or algae or what is it?  It's an aquatic plant.  In the US, it's also known as dogweed because dogs carry it out in their legs from pond  to pond.  And that's how it replicates in different ecosystems.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:21:00):**  It's very tiny.  It's a lentil and it grows only in the surface.  And so I imagine one of the challenges then is it's quite a complex business.  As you said, there's three parts.  One of them is who's going to eat this?  
**[0:21:13-0:21:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:21:13):**  What's the high value?  Is there a market for it now?  Who are you selling it to?  Tell me about that side.  Yes.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:21:19):**  So it turns out, and to be brutally honest, we didn't know this a year ago or when we  started to produce lemna, but then all the dogs are being connected now.  So I'm very happy about that.  But yeah, it turns out that at the beginning we were interested or attracted by lemna because  it has up to 40% protein content.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:21:40):**  And we thought, great, everyone is talking about alternative proteins.  This is the market.  But when you really look at the prices, alternative protein is quite marginalized and you are  competing against soy meal or if it's animal feed, even fish meal or other cheaper ingredients.  So that was at that end also for us.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:22:00):**  But once you start to study what are the other characteristics of lemna, we saw that it has  a very particular protein, aboumina, and it also has up to 30% pectin.  And these two are together as an amazing binary ingredient.  So a binary ingredient is, imagine an egg and what it's used for, but usually you use  it for coconut milk, almond milk to bring those two phases into one.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:22:32):**  Or you use it for plant-based meats as a replacement for methane cellulose.  It's just binding everything together, all the food.  And so it's an amazing ingredient for the plant-based food movement.  So you're sitting there at the beach, you get the Airbnb insight, you start pivoting  the business model, you have been running in that direction for the last couple of years  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:22:50):**  it sounds like.  What have been the challenges you've encountered along the way after this pivot?  Oh, many, I think like entrepreneurial life is a lot of challenges, but I will mention  two.  So one is, my grandpa used to raise cattle and we do have a tiny mango farm, et cetera.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:23:10):**  So I was brought up also a little bit in the field, but to be quite honest, it's an industry  that I'm not super familiar with.  So to come there and say, I have this idea, we can do things different and then to try  to adapt or bring together the startup world, which is like everything on Zoom, Slack, using  all these tools to an industry that first is very ancient, second it's very male-dominated  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:23:35):**  and then it's not as agile as the startup world.  And it's completely different structures, very vertical, et cetera.  So to try to bring these two worlds together has been quite a challenge.  For example, and lately this is a bit funny, but we love feedback, especially to the management  team because that's the only way that we can become better or we can learn.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:23:59):**  And so when you go to the field and tell that to the farm operators, we love feedback.  They are like, what?  What is it that you want from us?  And other examples are, for example, we have our team meeting where we like the team to  be involved and to put our face behind the work that they are doing.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:24:20):**  And so we do a lot of timelines, everything that we have achieved from, I don't know,  during this summer.  And sometimes those type of dynamics can be very childish to some people in the field  and they are like, we just lost one hour here hearing that story.  So those have been challenges.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:24:41):**  We're trying to approach them with, okay, they know their field and they have a lot  of money to add to, so let's build a bridge to that and try to find where are the limits  and what things are to start up life and won't be adapted to the field.  The second one is that the idea was thought as a scalable solution.  It's very big.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:25:02):**  It will only work once it's massive.  And so when you have one or two farms working and everything is very experimental and tiny,  it's very hard to sell the vision to like to leap to one day this is going to be the  common or the normal.  And it's also hard for us to prove it to others.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:25:24):**  Like we're going to bring this into that scale.  Going all the way back to the farmer and the value proposition for the farmer, that's obviously  one of the key pieces to get right here.  How does that work?  What do you tell them you're going to do?  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:25:35):**  What do you do with them or for them and what's in it for them?  So at the beginning we go in with a sales dialogue of saying we can trick your water  and you can make revenue out of that.  So we come to the farm, we teach them everything we know about cultivating lemna.  We provide them with the hardware.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:25:54):**  We train their team and then we say, okay, for every kilogram of lemna that you supply  us, we will pay such and such.  But the really amazing thing is that at the beginning you can never talk about we're going  to clean water and save you the water bill or that you didn't have to change the water  in the ponds or so because that's not really interesting.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:26:17):**  But ultimately after they have tried out our technology, they are super happy about that.  They are like, oh, my ammonia levels are so low.  I haven't changed water in, I don't know, two and a half weeks.  They become really fascinated by the water treatment solution, even though that's not  the first argument that we bring when knocking at the door.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:26:36):**  I heard someone say the other day, a friend of mine who works in ag tech, and he was saying,  like, I'm done with solutions that talk about cost savings.  Like I only want to be part of solutions that talk about revenue creation because it's so  much easier to get adoption.  And it sounds like you have both, but you're talking about one and then the other one is  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:26:51):**  a bit of a side dish.  And so that makes a lot of sense.  No.  And the thing that I love the most is like on the one hand side, we are stopping downstream  pollution, which is very important for us.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:27:02):**  And like in that way, making an impact.  But at the same time, we are pushing the new generation of foods, right?  All these plant based foods by providing an amazing ingredient in a way that we can think  of food should be like this.  Like it should be sustainably, it should be scalable and it should be cheap.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:27:21):**  What has it been like talking to investors?  So the company's grown, LinkedIn tells me you have 11 employees, but how big is the  company?  Have you raised money?  And what has it been like talking to investors?  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:27:31):**  You've got a couple challenges potentially like being in Mexico and it's complex and  like you said, scalability, but also like so aligned to these big, massive opportunities.  So tell me about the team and some of the investor conversations.  So right now we are at 13 in the company.  So after we closed our seed round, we went straight to hiring because we need a lot of  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:27:53):**  people and with more experience to pull this up.  And we're going to close it here by being 15.  And because each area needs a lot of people.  And so the fundraising at the beginning was kind of hard.  But then we started to see, okay, there are huge opportunities right now.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:28:10):**  This is the right time for this idea.  Like there is a lot of money in terms of climate tech coming in and there is a lot of money  for food tech.  Food tech is now being the next big thing.  And what we are doing is powering the plant-based future.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:28:24):**  Like doing a very important ingredient for all those foods.  So that was also into our advantage and also ag tech is growing.  And also the other amazing thing for us is that due to COVID-19, I think that the investment  landscape has flattened a lot.  And so that means that you didn't have to fly here and there to find the investors.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:28:50):**  It's just a soon goal.  And that allows you to optimize and to really speak to a hundred investors to get the money  for your idea.  And especially right now in Latin America, we are seeing a huge movement in terms of  entrepreneurs and investment funds being all more mature and investing more and taking  
**[0:29:07-0:29:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:29:07):**  more risks.  So I think we were very lucky.  Easy to say luck, but lots of hard work as well, especially if you're taking hundreds  of meetings.  So congratulations for getting to see Brown raised.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:29:17):**  The last thing I want to ask you, you mentioned it before around Mexico being a great place  to build a startup, one for the flexibility, but tell me a little bit more about what's  unique about Mexico or any kind of advantages of building a company there.  Sure.  I would say like the three main things like first it's cheaper.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:29:34):**  So when I compare myself to other friends that are pushing their startups, I don't know  in San Francisco or even Brazil, I see how the costs for us are so much lower and that  already gives you a lot more of runway and more possibilities.  So that is, it's huge.  Then the second thing is in Mexico.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:29:51):**  And of course this has downsides too, but all the rules are flexible.  So that means that, I don't know, you have to move a truck from one place to the other  and you cannot use that road and this and that.  And usually from my experience living in Germany or even in the U S the bureaucracy to try  to overcome that would have been massive.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:30:13):**  And here's just the fact of calling the person that owns the ranch there and you know, like  inviting them for a Coke or maybe a beer or like speaking them out and then making arrangements  and then it's all, and that is also very easy.  And then the third thing I would say people get very intrigued by new ideas.  So I remember at the beginning when we were thinking about the harvester, I would go with  
**[0:30:38-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:30:38):**  my chief science officer to just the hardware store and ask, we want to build this.  We have this problem.  Do you know someone that can help us with this and that?  And then they are genuinely like curious.  And so they try to help you out.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:30:53):**  Then it's like, no, I can't see enough.  I can't see that has this and that.  And then from talking to one person or to the other, you can get so many solutions.  And that is amazing.  What's the investor perceptions been like about Mexico city?  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:31:06):**  Have people been like, Oh, it's too hard to do business there, or we don't know anyone  there.  Have you had pushback like that?  At the beginning?  I had a lot of pushback by being in Mexico, generally in the country, not only mixing  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:31:16):**  city, but this time around, no, the opportunity was bigger than the challenge of being in  Mexico.  And then I also got some allies in Mexico that were talking to investors explaining  what the landscape looks like, et cetera.  And so that opened up the mind, I believe.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/2/28/marissa-cuevas-flores-microterra-startup-mexico#t=0:31:34):**  And that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.

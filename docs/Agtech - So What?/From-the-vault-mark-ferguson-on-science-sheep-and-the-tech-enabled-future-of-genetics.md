### Agtech - So What?  (2021-12-22)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the AgPentate Group.  I'm Sarah Nolet.  As we head off for the holidays and the summer here in Australia, we thought we'd bring back  
**[0:00:12-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:00:12):**  one of our favorite and most popular episodes from the AgTech So What Vault.  We'll be back at the start of 2022 with new episodes, but in the meantime, this is my  conversation with Mark Ferguson, or Ferg as he's better known, from back in February 2020.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:00:26):**  Ferg has gone from scientist to consultant to AgTech entrepreneur, and as you'll hear,  isn't afraid to push for change in the agriculture industry.  There's definitely people out there who think this is not going to be the way, but I think  
**[0:00:38-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:00:38):**  the same can be said for blockbusters.  There's all those examples of disruption that people sat there and watched the freight train  come at them until it went over the top of them and didn't change.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:00:48):**  And I don't want to be part of an industry that sits there and waits for the freight  train.  I want to be on that freight train and going into the future.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:00:54):**  As the co-founder and director of NextGen Agri, Ferg helps sheep farmers be profitable  and get the best out of their genetics.  At the time of this recording, we of course had no idea that a global pandemic was about  
**[0:01:05-0:01:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:01:05):**  to hit us, but it makes his insights on providing practical ag courses online especially relevant.  And his ideas on adoption, research commercialization, AgTech and consumer preferences are as relevant  as ever.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:01:17):**  So let's meet Ferg.  I grew up on a farm in northwest Victoria in the Mallee, a sheep and wheat farm from  about the age of 11.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:01:26):**  I think we started breeding sheep with my brother who's still there farming and breeding  sheep.  Off to Ag at Melbourne Uni, so a four year degree there, which I was lucky enough to  
**[0:01:35-0:01:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:01:35):**  have a cadetship, which got me involved with the Department of Prime Industries there in  Victoria.  That led me to Hamilton to work with some great people around nutrition in sheep, particularly  
**[0:01:45-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:01:45):**  in marinos.  And I guess that work then led me to want to understand them at a whole greater level  and so combine my passion of genetics with work, I suppose.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:01:56):**  So off to Perth to do a PhD with the late Norm Adams, who was really interested in how  we breed sheep to sort of better fit within the farming system, so did that.  And then research career off to New Zealand after that to do some work with the New Zealand  
**[0:02:11-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:02:11):**  Marino company, where we led a whole range of research to tackle a range of things, but  really to get good breeding systems implemented in New Zealand.  And from there started NextGen Agri to, I guess, do the bits of all that stuff that  
**[0:02:24-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:02:24):**  I was really passionate about and thought we could make the greatest change.  What Ferg is really passionate about is sheep genetics, but not all of his views are widely  held in the industry.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:02:34):**  I guess our job, or part of what we do is implementing good genetic programs, good breeding  programs on farm.  The way we approach that differently is probably not just to think about the profit side of  
**[0:02:45-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:02:45):**  that equation.  Genics are just as good at controlling costs and reducing time on farm as they are increasing  the output of animals.  
**[0:02:52-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:02:52):**  I think we are to our farming systems and to the animals to breed animals that can prosper  in our farming environments, so really matching genes to that environment so that they have  higher welfare plus higher production and then to the animal happy and the farmers happy  
**[0:03:05-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:03:05):**  is kind of the way we approach breeding.  So never just how do we get more out of this animal, it's about how do we fit that animal  best in the system to make the whole thing fit better, better for the farmer, better  
**[0:03:16-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:03:16):**  for the consumer, and better for the animals as well, is our approach.  So it's funny actually because from an outside perspective that seems obvious, like it seems  like good business and it seems like how you do things, but as I've learned more about  
**[0:03:29-0:03:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:03:29):**  the sheep industry in particular, that's not how things have always been done.  I mean you've showed me pictures of award-winning sheep from not too, too long ago that look  very different than the kind of sheep you'd advocate for today.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:03:42):**  Tell me a little bit about why that view or that approach is maybe not controversial,  but at least different than the way others think.  I guess we, not from, I don't have any traditional background in sheep breeding, we've approached  
**[0:03:56-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:03:56):**  it from just, yeah from first principles from the start, so just think about the kind of  traits that would keep an animal on farm and keep it healthy.  Seeing animals really perform from being in better condition score was the kind of really  
**[0:04:09-0:04:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:04:09):**  thing that I learned early and knowing that that was actually under genetic control rather  than just under feeding.  Obviously you can feed animals to be fatter, but you can also have animals that genetically  
**[0:04:17-0:04:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:04:17):**  want to be that way.  And it really stemmed from that and seeing how those animals thrive in their environment  just, yeah, just drives us every day.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:04:24):**  We've got clients out there that are literally trucking off truckloads more of lambs because  of that approach rather than just thinking about it as a, how do we get more out of that  animal?  
**[0:04:36-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:04:36):**  If we set an animal up right, we get more plus that animal is healthier.  The success of this approach is not something that Ferg is just seeing in research projects.  The Sutherland brothers at Benmore would be a great example of having a shape type, which  
**[0:04:50-0:05:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:04:50):**  was pretty traditional when I met them seven or eight years ago.  Part of what we worked with them was talking around condition scoring and managing those  sheep, but they've implemented lots of different size.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:05:02):**  You can see in those shape as the shape of changed, they're now thousands of more lambs  are coming out of that production system.  They're finishing in the earlier.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:05:09):**  There's a whole heap of things that have gone on as a result of just using size that had  a bit more fat and muscle, a bit more constitution and we're playing around, yeah, moving towards  what I would say is the modern animal.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:05:21):**  So if farmers are getting value out of these practices and this approach, why is it so  controversial?  Yeah, I think I guess across all of our lives, we're always hooked to paradigms of how we  
**[0:05:31-0:05:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:05:31):**  think things should look because of what they used to look like.  And that's still something we do every day.  We come across people who are a little bit, I guess, less keen on the shape of the animals  
**[0:05:42-0:05:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:05:42):**  or the way they look than what they used to.  But the reality is if that animal is healthier and is more profitable, then we're crazy not  to go down that line.  
**[0:05:51-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:05:51):**  Ferg believes that the power of genetics has the potential to not only help farmers be  more profitable, but also to help them align with consumer preferences.  Ferg's time at New Zealand Marino helped to shape this view as he got to see it happening  
**[0:06:05-0:06:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:06:05):**  firsthand.  My time there was definitely sort of instrumental in really for the first time being exposed  to overseas brands like directly as in meeting those people and taking them on farm and understanding  
**[0:06:17-0:06:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:06:17):**  the types of questions they are asking and where that was coming from.  I had the opportunity through New Zealand Marino to travel the states a couple of times  and get exposed to those directly to those consumer markets.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:06:27):**  And it becomes absolutely crystal clear once you're in those conversations what the future  is going to look like in terms of their expectations of us as farmers and people that work on farms.  So that time at New Zealand Marino really showed me that how much they value not just  
**[0:06:46-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:06:46):**  animal welfare, but also that relationship with farmers and that when their beliefs align  with the farming beliefs, then that's a really great story and a great opportunity, which  New Zealand Marino through their ZQ program have really capitalized on.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:07:00):**  Obviously, markets love hearing farmers' stories, particularly when their values align with  their own.  Tell me, what's an example of that?  
**[0:07:07-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:07:07):**  Either a conversation you had with one of those people from a brand or some of the work  that you were doing when you were there.  Help us, because I think a lot of people talk about it in farming, like, oh, well, now we  
**[0:07:16-0:07:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:07:16):**  have social media, so let's just tell the story of the farms.  Then you'll get a premium and connect with consumers and everyone will be happy.  And obviously, it doesn't really work like that.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:07:23):**  Yeah, so I guess the mulesing thing is a direct, really, really great example of how New Zealand  Marino basically took the hit more than 10 years ago and said, through our ZQ program,  we won't sell mules wool.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:07:38):**  And that has set them up for long-term contracts.  Icebreaker were the ones that sort of led that.  They've now got 10-year contracts with New Zealand growers and growers around the world  
**[0:07:48-0:08:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:07:48):**  based on their ethos of producing the fiber in the way they believe it should be produced.  So I've got clients in New Zealand that have a 10-year contract with Icebreaker, knowing  what that price or at least exactly how that price mechanism works for a decade in advance,  
**[0:08:02-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:08:02):**  which is just completely different for animal agriculture, really.  That doesn't exist anywhere in the world that I am aware of.  And that has been 100% led by that trust that you build by listening and working closely  
**[0:08:14-0:08:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:08:14):**  with those customers.  That's so interesting.  And you've had examples, I think, of those brand managers going out and actually being  
**[0:08:21-0:08:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:08:21):**  on a station and seeing how different it is or kind of challenging their own expectations  or understanding of farming.  Any good stories about that kind of thing?  
**[0:08:30-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:08:30):**  Yeah.  We had the whole management crew from Smartwool on farm a number of years ago.  And there's a bit of an offshoot breeding program I've been working on for a while,  
**[0:08:40-0:08:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:08:40):**  which is breeding short-tailed sheep and seeing their eyes light up when you show them those  animals and explain how that could be and just how engaged they are in that whole discussion  around how we can do things differently.  
**[0:08:53-0:09:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:08:53):**  Yeah, I mean, that really shaped the way I see the future.  And what's the so what here for farmers or even for ag tech companies looking to tap  into some of these macro consumer trends?  
**[0:09:05-0:09:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:09:05):**  I think what farmers completely underestimate all the time is how much they are the rock  stars to these brands.  Or the brands, when you get these people out from these big brands in the US or Japan or  
**[0:09:17-0:09:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:09:17):**  China or wherever, they absolutely love being on farm.  They love meeting the families, the kids, the dogs, and experiencing what we probably  take for granted in our industry, like being out in the open.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:09:30):**  And I know we all love and that's partly a big part of why we work in industry is the  environment we get to work in.  But we probably take it for granted how important that is to these international brands and  
**[0:09:39-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:09:39):**  how important it is for them to feel that connection of who they're, where they're sourcing  that fiber from, that really helps tell the story right from right through that is that  connection to both what you get to do when you're wearing wool, but also what and where  
**[0:09:53-0:10:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:09:53):**  that wool is coming from.  And that connection is huge.  And having witnessed that several times firsthand with taking brands out on farms, it's really  
**[0:10:01-0:10:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:10:01):**  powerful and really good to ground through some of the things that we were thinking of  when we were starting a small short-tail breeding program and just taking the brand to visit  that and see what their reaction was.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:10:12):**  It was really important to help.  Another one, we were putting sensors on sheep to try and understand welfare and getting  the brand reaction to that was really important to make sure we weren't just off in fairy  
**[0:10:21-0:10:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:10:21):**  land thinking this was important to them, but actually seeing them firsthand that they  did think it was important.  For anyone who's less familiar with the sheep industry, I asked Ferg to explain exactly

So obviously the sheep are obviously born with long tails, or some are and some aren't.  And so short tail length is heritable.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:10:41):**  So we can actually change that to a point where you no longer have to remove the tail  and it can still not get any health issues and that can go through life without that  process, I suppose.  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:10:53):**  And that's a way off.  It's not like we're going to achieve that next year, but I think that's definitely part  of our future.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:11:00):**  And what are some other traits that you're looking at or other changes to the animal  that align with environment or with consumers that you're excited about that are coming  online or in the near future, you think?  
**[0:11:12-0:11:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:11:12):**  I think disease resistance is a big one.  So no one likes to see unhealthy animals, least of all farmers.  And we have traditionally got around that through management processes and chemicals.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:11:24):**  Obviously we've got a world where chemicals are less and less okay in terms of our consumer  expectations.  So we've got animals that actually look after themselves.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:11:32):**  So foot rot resistance has been something we've been working on for a number of years.  So foot rots are as exactly as it sounds, is a disease of sheep's feet.  What we've shown over the last seven years in New Zealand is that we can breed sheep  
**[0:11:44-0:11:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:11:44):**  that don't get that illness.  For 20 years we've known you can do that for internal parasites, so worms.  You can breed sheep that are much less susceptible to worms.  
**[0:11:53-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:11:53):**  Same with flies.  There's a number of great clients who have over the last 10, 15 years have bred an animal  that doesn't get fly stroke anywhere near to the same rate as others.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:12:05):**  So I think all of those breeding approaches where you reduce animal illness and reduce  chemical use has to have some really good legs going forward.  When you talk about this stuff with clients, is it... because we obviously work in the  
**[0:12:19-0:12:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:12:19):**  ag tech space and talk a lot about adoption, and some of these changes you're talking about  making are 10 year programs and you won't see the results for a long time.  What is the... are people just true believers and they go on that journey?  
**[0:12:31-0:12:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:12:31):**  I can imagine in the app world people want a silver bullet that helps in a couple months  or a year and they want to see results.  Talking about a 10 year change must be really tough to get people on board, or what's the  
**[0:12:42-0:12:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:12:42):**  kind of psychology and adoption dynamics?  Yeah, it's really interesting and it differs between individuals, obviously, as long as  it doesn't in tech.  
**[0:12:52-0:13:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:12:52):**  I guess once people see it actually working, an individual animal they're sold, but until  that happens, it's a leap of faith.  And so it really has been a seven year lag now in our foot rot work, that this year,  
**[0:13:06-0:13:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:13:06):**  last year was the first time people really started to take note of that and start putting  it into breeding programs.  People that know the technology works, it's just an add on to that, so they trust that  
**[0:13:19-0:13:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:13:19):**  if it's going to come out as a breeding value, then they'll be able to implement it and it  will work.  But they just don't... until they see it and see those animals that it's highlighted  
**[0:13:26-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:13:26):**  as being resistant and then seeing what it means on their farm, that's when they really ... it does need to be implemented on farms for people to really see it and believe it.  But there's enough background knowledge of how breeding values have worked for every  
**[0:13:40-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:13:40):**  other thing that people are willing to take that leap of faith and believe that we'll  deliver something useful.  That's crazy.  
**[0:13:48-0:14:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:13:48):**  Are there still people who find all of this, everything you've said in the last 10 or 15  minutes pretty controversial or would push back hard and how would they... what would  that argument look like or is everyone on board with what you've said?  
**[0:14:00-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:14:00):**  No, not everyone's on board.  So there's an element of people that think we should be able to farm the way we always  have or we should be able to breed the animals the way we always have and that's their prerogative.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:14:12):**  So there's definitely a significant spectrum of beliefs across the industry and lots of  those don't align with our thinking.  But I guess the reality is that the change is happening and if you're not changing then  
**[0:14:28-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:14:28):**  there's only really one way the business is going.  How does it feel like?  What's it like for you... it can be tough to be out on the cutting edge of some things  
**[0:14:38-0:14:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:14:38):**  and feel like there's people pulling you back or pulling against you or fighting against  you?  What is it... I don't know, any examples that come to mind or any moments where it's  
**[0:14:46-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:14:46):**  been... yeah, like any good stories of kind of that tension?  Have you ever been booed off stage?  Not directly to my face.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:14:59):**  I think in my younger days I was much more... I guess I went to front people more now  I sort of... I'm confident that the way we approach and breeding and the way that the  industry is going to go that we don't need to convince others there's enough good people  
**[0:15:12-0:15:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:15:12):**  coming along for the ride that we have a good future.  I think we... yeah, there's definitely people out there who think this is not going to be  the way but I think the same could be said for blockbusters.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:15:25):**  There's all those examples of disruption that you know better than I do that people sat  there and watched the freight train come at them until it went over the top of them and  didn't change.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:15:35):**  I don't want to be part of an industry that sits there and waits for the freight train  and I want to be on that freight train and going into the future.  I like that one thing you have on your website is farming in our hearts, science in our heads  
**[0:15:47-0:15:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:15:47):**  and that kind of balance of passion but data-driven approaches I guess is kind of one way to sum  that up.  Yeah, and that was a great moment as I was driving along in the middle of Western Victoria  
**[0:15:59-0:16:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:15:59):**  when I came up with that but I think it is exactly how we are.  We are all very passionate about farming.  It's in our veins, it's in our hearts.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:16:07):**  It's what we sleep and breathe but we also approach that with a level of science, a level  of knowledge, a level of data and really try and think about it in not just from an emotional  way but in a business sense and in a scientific sense.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:16:24):**  So you have been on farm, you've been on the research and science side, you've been in  a commercial company and now you're out on your own.  Tell me about the, like what was the decision like to go out on your own?  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:16:36):**  Was there a moment where you said I have to do this?  Was it hard?  Tell me a little bit about that.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:16:42):**  Yeah I think I sort of had two goes at that.  So before I went to New Zealand Marino company I was almost going to go out on my own.  I sort of started building that way and then the opportunity to go to New Zealand and do  
**[0:16:53-0:17:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:16:53):**  that job came up.  So I sort of shelved that for a while but there was always this sort of burning desire  to, I'm not sure whether it was just because I didn't like being controlled or whether  
**[0:17:02-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:17:02):**  I wanted to go out and do my own thing but I guess I was always going to do it so it  was a matter of just biting the bullet.  It was tough, it was about three young children.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:17:13):**  The big thing is financial security obviously.  Going out on your own means you've got to, you need to find money to live and also then  to grow you've got to employ people so that real first six months where you, well that  
**[0:17:26-0:17:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:17:26):**  first step where you know the wages have stopped but you're not sure where the next income  is coming from is uncomfortable to say the least and I don't think that goes away that  quickly because you're always looking to grow, you're always looking to employ new people  
**[0:17:39-0:17:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:17:39):**  and do new things so it's a different, it certainly has been a really great learning  journey and a great experience and I think, I used to think I worked hard until you actually  work for yourself and then you really know you work hard.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:17:54):**  But it is, it's great work and there's lots of people listening will be entrepreneurs  or self-starters or people on the land that know that it's great working, it's so much  better working for yourself and knowing that those hours you're putting in are growing  
**[0:18:08-0:18:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:18:08):**  a better future for you and your family is the plan.  Tell me about the NextGen model, like you guys have done a combination of consulting  and research and playing with technology and online.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:18:22):**  What's the, give us your pitch where you're up to right now.  Yeah, so NextGen is a combination of all things I like.  So we made a company that did all those things.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:18:32):**  I guess at our core we are a consulting business to farmers, pretty much solely around genetics,  implementing good genetic programs across from Western Australia through to both islands  of New Zealand so we've got clients all over the place and so at our core is that consulting  
**[0:18:48-0:19:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:18:48):**  and that direct dealing with farmers and we're really, really fortunate to work with some  of the industry's best and it's great to get out of bed and work with those people.  I've also obviously with my research career and desire to do things at an industry level,

Do you see more kind of support in agriculture moving online?

**[0:20:30-0:20:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:20:30):**  view of agriculture that's kind of sitting down at the pub or shaking hands and truly  relationship based which I guess implies you have to be in person.  Is there a tension there or is online just an enhancement of what you can do in person?  
**[0:20:44-0:21:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:20:44):**  Yeah I think success will be a combination I think I often hear clients say like they  go to a full day workshop or something they've driven three hours for and they only really  went there to hear one speaker and the seven others they sort of heard and had a cup of  
**[0:21:01-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:21:01):**  tea or a beer and then went home again so to me the online training makes that a whole  lot more efficient because you can just hear that one speaker and even interact with them  at a whole much better level if there's not the tyranny of distance involved and the timing  
**[0:21:15-0:21:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:21:15):**  issues but I also think that you can't just do online and you can't just people need to  learn from each other as well as learning from so-called experts so getting them in  a room and interacting is critical so walking that tightrope is going to be something we

**[0:22:14-0:22:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:22:14):**  or is it more you know we're really targeting these kinds of people or these kinds of growers.  I think we're targeting farming couples that have taken on some debt to either grow their  family business or to buy a new one so I guess our target persona is those young youngish  
**[0:22:31-0:22:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:22:31):**  and I call myself young at mid 40s who are really taking on some significant debt some  significant stresses associated with that some significant sort of I guess family pressures  to succeed and just wrapping around a layer of support around those people that that helps  
**[0:22:47-0:23:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:22:47):**  them make some some pretty big decisions like we're not talking about small just backyard  operations this can be several million dollar businesses tens of million dollar businesses  they're making some decisions that that that aren't that comfortable so and they need some  
**[0:23:02-0:23:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:23:02):**  support so I think our persona probably is yeah that that farming couple farming family  that that really want to get on and and grow their grow their businesses but also have  a bit of pressure from from debt like we like we all do.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:23:16):**  Interesting you say farming family that's one of the big things that I know you and  I've talked about a lot the kind of role of families and decision-making and it's not  just maybe the bloke you see on the farm that you know it's actually a family and and lots  
**[0:23:28-0:23:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:23:28):**  of intricacies to how those decisions are made so I don't know if you have anything  to say about that I guess you one of the articles you wrote recently that that you can see now  on the website I can link to it is around how farmers are just people who farm and there's  
**[0:23:39-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:23:39):**  all this I guess hype around you know what our farmers and are they really different  than other people but at the end of the day they're just people?  Yeah I guess I'm really really strong on that having grown up my mum and dad work very close  
**[0:23:51-0:24:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:23:51):**  together to make ends meet and to to get our farm ticking over and get us all educated  and doing what we do now.  You know all the people that I work with it's there's some great farming couples and some  
**[0:24:03-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:24:03):**  great farming families out there and so to limit that to just I guess the stereotypical  male is would be a limitation and not something that I think is even relevant to agriculture  it's about it's about that whole whole family and how that works together to make a to make  
**[0:24:17-0:24:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:24:17):**  business and make decisions and and go forward there's never there's never an individual  who's doing it all and the other person's just got their feet up on the couch.  Beyond just rethinking extension and what the future of livestock consulting will look  
**[0:24:30-0:24:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:24:30):**  like NextGen Agri and Ferg have been playing with tech in a more traditional ag tech sense  as well.  This all started for Ferg with a trip to where I'm from Silicon Valley.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:24:42):**  Yeah just being in the industry and getting exposed to I could pretty much think it back  to going to Silicon Valley for the first time and just getting exposed to the tech world  there through New Zealand Reno and just hearing about what was happening in augmented reality  
**[0:24:56-0:25:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:24:56):**  what was happening in machine learning what was happening in in gene editing what was  happening in so and the some of the fantastic speakers were exposed to at Stanford University  that really just lifted my sights completely about what the future looks like and I guess  
**[0:25:11-0:25:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:25:11):**  the great opportunity for us in Ag is that we know these problems better than anybody  I want to be part of that tech future where we know the problem clearly we understand  the tech enough to be able to apply that so we've done a variety of things we've done  
**[0:25:26-0:25:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:25:26):**  some things around sensor tags the thing that we're really interested in is the ability  to apply image analysis to problems on farm the one that we're really running out at the  moment is is facial recognition in shape because that on the little underpin a whole other  
**[0:25:42-0:25:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:25:42):**  changes that we can make through automated we can automate lots of measurement lots of  understanding of what's happening on farm if we can get facial recognition working so  that's our current focus so this is like a camera and and taking a picture of a sheep  
**[0:25:55-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:25:55):**  and saying okay this is the sheep or is it is it are you saying other things about the  sheep what are you actually kind of measuring you know I think where are the cameras tell  us a little bit about their give us a paint us a picture of what that looks like yeah  
**[0:26:07-0:26:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:26:07):**  so we did some work with I don't know why we had a crate set up and had four cameras  around that crate and took a heap of images of each shape and then through collaboration  with University of Sydney analyzed all that and worked out that in concept form that worked  
**[0:26:20-0:26:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:26:20):**  we could tell shape different separately from each other so I think in that work we had  1900 individuals and it would tell with sort of 99% plus accuracy which individual that  was just by the photo of it were you surprised by that I guess yes and kind of no because  
**[0:26:37-0:26:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:26:37):**  I know that I walk through the airports every day and the only thing that lets me in the  gate is is facial recognition cameras under that controlled scenario so so I guess there's  no reason that shape are different than humans apart from a few obvious aspects but then  
**[0:26:54-0:27:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:26:54):**  but that works or didn't wasn't taking us closer to because putting shape in a crate  if you're gonna create you know they are and you can weigh them and do everything else  you need to so we wanted to move that to what how can we do that out on out on farm or in  
**[0:27:07-0:27:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:27:07):**  a more commercial context so now we're running retraining models we're running we've got  a race set up that's got four cameras on it so we run shape through which gives us about  30 frames so 30 individual images of the shape as they bolt through same as any normal drafting  
**[0:27:24-0:27:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:27:24):**  rice drenching rice we've run down that and the idea is that that would be directly linked  to a camera in the paddock and so that once the ID once it runs past the the animal is  linked to to its a ID to its RFID and then we know who it is and then so an image of  
**[0:27:39-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:27:39):**  that shape wherever it is on the farm will know who that animal is that's the the work  we're doing right now to train that model so the moment we've run around about six or  seven hundred shape through through that rice plus we've taken images as individual shape  
**[0:27:54-0:28:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:27:54):**  out on in a paddock and so we're training a machine learning model at the moment to  do that and if that works then we sort of onto the next stages of actual behavioral  tracking and working out when they're grazing when they're doing whatever from from images  
**[0:28:07-0:28:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:28:07):**  so we've got a range of different work through students and collaborations going on on that  cross that spectrum at the moment that is super exciting do you so that I mean that  in itself could become its own business or kind of take all of this work to the next  
**[0:28:22-0:28:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:28:22):**  level is that the vision and the aspiration yeah so James Smith dot AI is a company that  is sort of waiting to be formed once we get once we get some of this working so we say  that as being a standalone component which will become a spin-off from from next year  
**[0:28:37-0:28:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:28:37):**  agree which will be mainly what which will focus on on consulting and that and that online  training aspect plus plus some research but we see that whole tech space is sort of big  having growing a life of its own and and getting its own team and really driving forward because  
**[0:28:53-0:29:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:28:53):**  it's just an enormous opportunity for to to really take big steps in the shape industry  towards understanding what individuals are doing the same as what we see in in in yield  monitoring and in our culture and cropping and what we see in dairy cows in the shape  
**[0:29:08-0:29:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:29:08):**  industry we really have been limited to mob based stuff and if we get beyond that then  we open up a whole new level of opportunity that that really is just sitting there waiting  to be explored I'm excited to have you back on the podcast in a year or two and hear an  
**[0:29:24-0:29:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:29:24):**  update on how that's going hopefully one not two deal when you talk to farmers whether  clients are not about this work and facial recognition and all this tech what's the what's  the response like we don't talk so much about the tech but about what we can do with it  
**[0:29:43-0:30:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:29:43):**  which is which is matching news to the lambs matching performance to the animal monitoring  animals remotely those sort of things get people really excited I think the big one  is is just that they want to know their animals are healthy and happy and if they've got a  
**[0:30:01-0:30:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:30:01):**  system that helps them do that with a level of integrity that means that that they can  go on holiday or they can or they can go to town that day and do something else knowing  that their animals are safe and happy that that peace of mind I think is a massive aspect  
**[0:30:16-0:30:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:30:16):**  there's also obviously the upside in terms of productivity but first and foremost the  people across agriculture love seeing healthy animals and any system that helps them be  really early with with making changes to make sure their animals are healthy and productive  
**[0:30:30-0:30:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:30:30):**  I think that gets people excited that that real ability to monitor animals at a whole  new level and it ties back to your point about consumers as well I mean there's increasing  pressure on being able to prove some of those kinds of things welfare and you know well-being  
**[0:30:45-0:30:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:30:45):**  and keeping that clean green image there so I imagine there's some potential there as  well yeah I understand that yeah we've started off with the sense of work with really that  in mind and we saw we talked about that to those those brand partners they love the concept  
**[0:30:59-0:31:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:30:59):**  of monitoring animals 24-7 and and so it wasn't just a pipe dream that the animals were being  looked after they really were monitored and looked after and and yeah that was that resonates  with farmers and it does with consumers with an expert like Ferg on the show it'd be a  
**[0:31:16-0:31:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:31:16):**  mistake not to ask about the future of the sheep industry and where he sees things headed  yeah I guess yeah I'm very as we all are we're I guess consumer trends and what's changing  and I think I think like the current strong demand for wool we're seeing and for natural  
**[0:31:33-0:31:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:31:33):**  fiber I think that seems to be not just a flash in the pan it seems to be a real thing  and that's stemming from a real desire from some of these big brands to really have a  product they can stand behind in terms of the whole whole backstory of that product  
**[0:31:48-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:31:48):**  so I think I think we're in for in for good days in the in the natural fiber industry  I think as we understand more about micro fibers going into oceans and the whole way  for things that the plastics are are doing to the planet and a natural fiber that biodegrades  
**[0:32:03-0:32:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:32:03):**  within the six months of hitting the ground sort of ticks a lot of boxes in terms of the  footprint the overall footprint of growing wool production I don't think we can sit back  and and say yep jobs right we we produce protein and the world needs more protein and so we're  
**[0:32:20-0:32:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:32:20):**  going to be we're going to in for great times and we produce wool and the world needs more  wool we're in for great times I think we need to be really smart and think about what that  looks like if we are going to demand a premium price we have to be premium producers so we  
**[0:32:31-0:32:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:32:31):**  need to be really aware of what that consumer wants they're going to wool because they want  to have a really good backstory but they're not going to go to wool if there's skeletons  in the closet that put that brand at risk and so we need to be really thinking about  
**[0:32:43-0:32:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:32:43):**  what what's happening on farm what's happening in our breeding what's happening across everything  we do in our marketing in our in our in our manufacture what's happening across that whole  spectrum that that might be viewed negatively in 10 years and think about how I guess in  
**[0:32:59-0:33:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:32:59):**  our lifetime how much more scrutiny has come on what what we're doing and more aware people  are what's happening both on farm but in the whole in that whole process from sort of from  farm right through to to garment I think we need to be really aware of making sure we've  
**[0:33:15-0:33:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:33:15):**  we're squeaky clean and we are producing in a really premium way and I think environmental  credentials and welfare are going to be going to lead that.

**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:02:33):**  held in the industry.

**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:02:51):**  the output of animals.

**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:02:56):**  in our farming environments, so really matching genes to that environment so that they have

**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:03:05):**  is kind of the way we approach breeding.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:03:07):**  So never just how do we get more out of this animal, it's about how do we fit that animal  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:03:11):**  best in the system to make the whole thing fit better, better for the farmer, better

**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:03:20):**  So it's funny actually because from an outside perspective that seems obvious, like it seems  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/2/16/ep-60-mark-ferguson-on-science-sheep-and-the-tech-enabled-future-of-genetics#t=0:03:26):**  like good business and it seems like how you do things, but as I've learned more about

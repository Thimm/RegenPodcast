**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:15):**  A huge thanks to Trimble for partnering with us to bring you today's show.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:19):**  Also a quick note, we have a ton of insights to bring you this week on the future of fertilizer,  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:24):**  so to keep things snappy, we're going to skip our Raising Out Loud segment.

**[0:00:34-0:00:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:34):**  Now onto the show.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:36):**  Today, we're tackling part two of our future of fertilizer discussion, focusing in on the  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:41):**  business models of nitrogen and how completely reimagined strategies may be poised to change  
**[0:00:47-0:00:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:47):**  the buying and selling of crop inputs.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:49):**  But first, I think it's worth a reminder of why this story matters so much right now.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:54):**  Fifty percent of the world gets their nitrogen from synthetic nitrogen sources.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:03):**  So said another way, if we didn't have synthetic or chemical nitrogen, we would only have enough  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:08):**  nitrogen to have three billion people in the world.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:12):**  The bad news is for every pound of nitrogen you make, you make four pounds of CO2.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:18):**  Of that synthetic nitrogen you put on the ground, half of it washes off and ends up  
**[0:01:23-0:01:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:23):**  in our waterways.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:24):**  So it's like a huge environmental crisis.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:27):**  With the Russia invasion of the Ukraine, we now also have a humanitarian crisis because,  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:35):**  number one, Russia makes about 20 percent of the world's nitrogen fertilizer.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:39):**  Ukraine makes, I think the number is around 12 or 15 percent of the world's wheat.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:45):**  So while you and I in the developed parts of the world are paying more and will continue  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:50):**  to pay more for our food, there's a pretty big part of the developing world that's not  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:55):**  going to have nitrogen and not going to have food.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:58):**  That's Bill Brady, CEO and director at Kula Bio, a company that's harnessing the power  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:02):**  of microbes to reduce emissions in the crop nutrient supply chain.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:06):**  In the second part of our discussion, we focused on the challenges around marketing, distribution  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:10):**  and scale, and how innovation is baked into more than just the biology of their product.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:15):**  Well, a really interesting aspect of this technology is that we can decentralize the  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:21):**  production and not lose the economics.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:25):**  And the farmers really lit up on the thought of this because, of course, synthetic nitrogen  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:31):**  is humongous centralized production.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:34):**  And then it goes through a distribution and supply chain that many farmers would describe  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:42):**  as a bit difficult to work through.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:44):**  They really love the idea of it being closer to the farm, a little bit of just-in-time  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:49):**  capability.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:50):**  And then there's a lot of really interesting business models that might be interesting  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:54):**  to do.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:55):**  So we're in the process now of figuring out what does decentralized mean.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:01):**  We had a thought early on that it might mean on the farm.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:06):**  But I don't think farmers have enough problems.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:08):**  They don't want to deal with fattening up microbes.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:11):**  So it's probably a regional type situation where, you know, 100 or a couple hundred farms  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:17):**  get served by a certain site.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:20):**  And then we'll figure out the right partners, distributors that the farmers trust.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:25):**  We'll figure out the right partners to get it to the farmers in an efficient and economic  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:29):**  way.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:30):**  I imagine the resistance from the existing fertilizer industry could be quite strong  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:36):**  if you're replacing some of their product and therefore some of their revenues, if you're  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:40):**  talking about setting up a local operation, like the human psychology of who's willing  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:45):**  to take on that and the potential pushback they might get from the established industry  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:50):**  that's often really embedded in the community.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:53):**  How does that dynamic play out or how do you see it playing out?  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:57):**  First of all, I would tell you all of the incumbent industry players have been here  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:02):**  to talk to us, to figure out if there's ways to make one plus one equal three.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:09):**  So we're sorting through that.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:11):**  For a company like ours, the challenge is, in my opinion, you want to have that established,  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:18):**  very strong distribution network supportive of what you're doing, but you also can't be  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:24):**  held hostage to what they want to do or don't want to do.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:28):**  And big companies, I ran a big company before I started working in small companies.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:33):**  They think they're innovative.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:35):**  They think they like to change, but they don't.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:39):**  And so we've got to find a way in the beginning to both create the pull through from the farmers  
**[0:04:46-0:04:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:46):**  and the packagers and the CPG companies and get some parts of the distribution network  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:53):**  who really do want to lock arms with us and move it.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:56):**  And then when some of these big companies have a sales meeting and somebody has to report  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:00):**  that their numbers are down because they lost farmers to Cula Bio, then we can have the  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:06):**  discussion about partnerships.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:07):**  So that's how we view it.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:09):**  And I'm not being critical, I'm just being realistic, but that's how we view it and how  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:13):**  we're proceeding.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:14):**  Kat Kerlin Biologicals have been really on the radar recently, a bunch of acquisitions,  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:19):**  investments, et cetera in this space, but also kind of have a bit of a bad rep in agriculture.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:23):**  I'm curious how you go about tackling that perception.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:27):**  Michael O'Reilly Yeah, it's there for sure.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:30):**  There was a period there, I don't know if it's five, 10 years ago, I don't know what  
**[0:05:36-0:05:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:36):**  it was.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:37):**  A lot of the farmers use the term snake oil when they talk about biologics.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:43):**  So that's a hard hurdle to get over.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:45):**  It's also hard, I think, if your business model is to ask the farmer to give you X dollars  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:51):**  per acre now, and then you'll get it back in yield at the end.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:56):**  That's a much harder sell than what we're trying to say to the farmers, look, just give  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:01):**  us the same amount of money you were paying for the synthetic and it'll be the same.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:05):**  So it's hard.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:07):**  The way we're trying to deal with it is to not have the Silicon Valley hype to our company,  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:14):**  but to be conservative, to be humble and to do the work.

**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:23):**  the scoreboard rather than boast about 100 things we can do and not deliver on it.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:29):**  You won't get a second chance with the farmers if you do that.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:32):**  So we're just trying to be as credible as we can to do the work.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:36):**  We've raised enough money and we have investors who understand that, I think, even though  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:41):**  there's always a little tension there.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:42):**  But that's what we're trying to do.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:43):**  It's like good old fashioned hard work and good old fashioned business building.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:47):**  I imagine that some of the challenges with the product being a biological is just does  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:53):**  it work?  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:54):**  But you'd also have things like who's selling it, agronomic recommendations, shelf life,  
**[0:06:59-0:07:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:59):**  depending on where it comes from.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:01):**  How much of that do you feel like you guys can really take on?  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:05):**  Is it Kula reps wearing Kula shirts having Kula conversations?  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:09):**  Or is this a kind of channel education?  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:12):**  Or is it more trials and the scientific data?  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:15):**  What are the tactics for managing or tackling those perceptions?  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:20):**  I think it's both.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:21):**  I really do think you need to have the support of the agronomy networks that know the fields  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:28):**  and been doing it for decades and decades.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:31):**  But on the other hand, this is different.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:32):**  And so we need our own experts in the field holding hands, locking arms with the farmers  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:38):**  and these advisors and making sure the products gets used right and is most effective on the  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:43):**  farm.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:44):**  One thing though, we're in the phase now, we're trying to make this term from just trials  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:51):**  to a certain number of early adopter customers.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:57):**  And these are customers who ultimately are very large growers or have a very large contract  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:03):**  growing network.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:05):**  And we've done some work with them on trials, but now we're focusing on bigger and bigger  
**[0:08:10-0:08:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:10):**  acreage, optimizing the product for their crops, and ultimately commercializing together.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:18):**  And that's a little different than just developing a product, putting it for sale and see who  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:23):**  buys it.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:24):**  But we're really trying to step through this together with these key early adopters.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:29):**  And who does the competition tend to be?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:31):**  Like I imagine just status quo is the biggest one, but do you get conversations around other  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:36):**  nitrogen replacements, other biologicals?  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:38):**  What's the landscape look like?  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:41):**  Most farmers are not using any of other biologicals.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:44):**  So when we're in these real discussions at the farm level, it's really relative to either  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:50):**  their synthetic or their organic sources of nitrogen that they've been using for a long  
**[0:08:55-0:08:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:55):**  time.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:56):**  And that's really where we've kept our focus with regard to other biologicals doing nitrogen-related  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:03):**  work.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:04):**  There's plenty of room for more than one person to be successful, for sure.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:09):**  And I don't know what they're doing, but I hope there's a handful of us who are really  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:12):**  successful and we really make a big difference in the world.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:15):**  Another aspect of the business model where Kula has gone with perhaps a less obvious  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:18):**  path is the type of farming system they're starting in.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:23):**  We took a really important decision early on in the company as to which markets we were  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:28):**  going to focus on.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:30):**  And we ultimately decided that we were going to do produce first and row crop second.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:36):**  At the end of the day, there were a whole host of reasons why we were going to do that.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:41):**  But that was the point of significant debate of what it took to be successful in produce  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:49):**  versus row crops, what the real capabilities of these microbes were, and would be, how  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:56):**  much we could really realistically develop them over the next five years.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:01):**  And just trying to put all that together on how you go about matching technology and market  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:07):**  fit.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:09):**  Because for sure, the acreage in corn, wheat, soy is, my gosh, your mouth water is thinking  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:14):**  about the acreage and acreage there.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:17):**  But we thought we could actually get to that faster.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:20):**  We still believe we're going to get to that faster by going through produce first.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:24):**  But there was quite a hell of a debate.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:26):**  What do you see as the biggest challenges, either now or in the future, for scaling Kula's  
**[0:10:31-0:10:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:31):**  technology?  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:32):**  And what's your strategy there?  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:33):**  What's on the horizon and how are you going to tackle those challenges?  
**[0:10:36-0:10:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:36):**  The product works.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:38):**  The product works, it's not perfect yet, but the product works.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:41):**  And so we still have a little bit of time ahead of us to make the product perfect.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:47):**  The bioprocessing is in a really strong position, but it's not perfect yet.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:52):**  And so we need to do that as well.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:54):**  But on both of those things, we don't need technology miracles.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:59):**  We don't need breakthrough innovations.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:02):**  We need really good, hard science and engineering work to get there.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:07):**  So I feel great about that.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:09):**  I think the biggest thing is ultimately getting the farmer to say yes.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:13):**  We can have the best product, we can have our bioprocessing and our costs in place,  
**[0:11:17-0:11:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:17):**  but getting the farmer to take that amount of risk and say yes is the biggest challenge.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:25):**  And I think getting over it is multifaceted.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:28):**  It's around doing our work, having all our ducks in a row on the field results.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:33):**  It's about having the supporting networks behind us.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:37):**  And it's about spending time with the farmers and being patient to step through it with  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:41):**  them in whatever they view as their de-risking steps.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:46):**  And we're just going to have to do that.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:48):**  Have you thought about any business model changes there, whether that's like an embedded  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:52):**  risk management kind of tactic with that adoption or a downstream supply chain pull around some  
**[0:11:58-0:12:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:58):**  of those environmental incentives?  
**[0:12:00-0:12:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:00):**  Are those avenues worth exploring?  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:02):**  Yeah, and we're exploring all of them.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:05):**  It's not inconceivable to think about some form of insurance as part of the early offerings.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:11):**  A price on carbon and that bonus would be fantastic, but we are both going to get old

**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:20):**  I really hope I'm wrong on that, but that's a huge upside for us when it happens.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:26):**  But yeah, we've thought about all those things.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:28):**  Because also just based on the way we make the microbes, there might be some interesting  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:34):**  pricing models for farmers that might make a lot of sense that address both the price  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:40):**  volatility they have to deal with now, because nitrogen is so closely tied to fossil fuels.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:46):**  The wild variation in prices is really difficult for farmers.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:50):**  We can take all that away because we don't have any dependence on fossil fuels and our  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:55):**  inputs are quite benign.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:58):**  So there's a lot of interesting things we can do ultimately to take that risk down and  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:01):**  to make it really make a lot of sense for the farmer.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:05):**  That part seems really interesting to me in terms of once you democratize biology or digitize  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:10):**  biology, whatever you want to call it, when you understand so much more about how the  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:13):**  world around us works, you can tie the digital to the physical.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:17):**  And so you can say, we know now when it gets really wet or when it gets really dry or when  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:22):**  these kinds of things happen, how the biology is going to perform.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:26):**  And so we can actually have products that consider that, or we know how pricing volatility  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:31):**  will or won't change or those kinds of things.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:33):**  And so you can share in those economics when you understand that much more granularly about  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:38):**  how the biology is working.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:39):**  So it seems like that's going to be part of the future.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:41):**  I think so.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:42):**  I think you're definitely right about that.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:43):**  I would say one of the things we are trying to do, because we start from such a robust  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:50):**  microbe starting point, is try to take some of that complexity out of it.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:56):**  So a couple of the really big advantages of what we do is, number one, just because these  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:03):**  microbes are so robust, the quantity of nitrogen that we can deliver.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:08):**  And then the other thing that's really interesting is that our microbes are plant agnostic, because  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:16):**  the microbe is an independent actor in the soil, grabbing nitrogen from the air, depositing  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:20):**  it in the soil.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:21):**  So it doesn't really matter what the plant is, whereas a genetically modified approach  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:27):**  can sometimes be pretty dependent on plant-soil combinations.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:31):**  I know when we looked at the precision fermentation space, for example, there's increasingly supply  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:37):**  constraints on getting strains, but also on just scaling up in bioreactor capacity.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:43):**  Is that something that you guys face, or you're different enough that you've got enough control  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:47):**  of your own destiny in terms of scale up?  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:50):**  We definitely have felt what you just described, and it's part of the reason we went ahead  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:55):**  and built out this facility.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:58):**  So we'll have the pilot scale capacity by the end of this year, and then the demonstration  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:04):**  scale, which will be full commercial scale, maybe 18 months after that.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:09):**  Another kind of interesting aspect to that, and I'm sure maybe some of my other biologic  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:14):**  startup companies share the same thing, is while we have a good contract manufacturer,  
**[0:15:20-0:15:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:20):**  we don't teach them everything.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:22):**  So in some way, I think everybody needs to get their own manufacturing so they can do  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:27):**  all their proprietary stuff without any hesitation.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:30):**  Which comes back to your point early on around the capital stacks that are available to fund  
**[0:15:35-0:15:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:35):**  these kinds of things, and until investors get increasingly comfortable with, we need  
**[0:15:38-0:15:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:38):**  physical things that are made in physical places.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:40):**  This isn't necessarily crazy high capex.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:43):**  We can still think about margins, and we can still think about capital efficiency, but  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:47):**  it's not just software, and that's what's going to be needed, at least in our view,  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:50):**  to solve some of these climate challenges.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:52):**  So we can't shy away from that.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:53):**  That's right.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:54):**  You do have to get the right set of investors because this is not software.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:58):**  These are not apps we're developing.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:00):**  This is tough tech, if you will.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:03):**  So you need a reasonable amount of capital, but more importantly, you need a reasonable  
**[0:16:08-0:16:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:08):**  amount of time.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:09):**  And these ventures, every one of mine that had been successful, have taken seven to 10  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:15):**  years, and every other one that I've ever been involved in, looked at, read about, heard  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:19):**  about, successful, have been seven to 10 years.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:23):**  And so you've got to have the staying power to do it.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:26):**  From our perspective, the more distributed model that Cula is exploring, which has a  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:30):**  fundamentally different idea of scale than the large, centralized Haber-Bosch facilities  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:34):**  of today's fertilizer sector, reminds us of the model that Jupiter Ionics is pursuing  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:39):**  with a different product.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:41):**  Here's Charlie Day, CEO of Jupiter Ionics.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:44):**  And I'll disclose again, Jupiter Ionics is a portfolio company of ours here at Tenacious  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:48):**  Ventures.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:49):**  And of course, this is not investment advice.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:51):**  So there's the business model for us as the manufacturer of ammonia synthesis equipment,  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:57):**  and there's a range of models that we see in similar electrochemical sectors that we  
**[0:17:03-0:17:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:03):**  could follow.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:04):**  So it's actually ranging from us licensing our technology to other manufacturers to make  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:08):**  our kits through to us actually manufacturing turnkey ammonia production units ourselves.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:14):**  But then there's quite a lot of interest then about what's the business model for those  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:17):**  to use that technology.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:18):**  And as I mentioned before, it's a little bit like moving from centralized to decentralized  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:22):**  power generation.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:24):**  Once you move into a world where people are generating power in a distributed fashion  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:28):**  or making fertilizer in a distributed fashion, you open up lots of really interesting business  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:32):**  models, different ways to actually service the end customers.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:35):**  So we certainly expect that as we bring our technology to market, that will enable some  
**[0:17:41-0:17:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:41):**  really creative business models as well.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:43):**  And in terms of ag, who do you see as some of your initial customers?  
**[0:17:47-0:17:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:47):**  Like how might you work with the agricultural industry?  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:50):**  Is it a kind of straight replacement for something farmers are already using?  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:53):**  What kind of farmers are they?  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:55):**  What kinds of use cases do you see?  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:56):**  Yeah, so we're chemists and chemical engineers originally, so we're learning a lot about

**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:03):**  And so there are some parts of the industry where we expect potentially will be a, if  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:08):**  you like a drop in replacement.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:09):**  So there are plenty of parts of the world where anhydrous ammonia is used directly as  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:13):**  a fertilizer.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:14):**  And so what we can do potentially there is offer a decentralized generation solution  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:20):**  that cuts out the supply chain from the original plant, but you're still applying anhydrous  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:25):**  ammonia as your final form of fertilizer.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:27):**  But there are plenty of other places where different fertilizers are in use.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:30):**  And so we're developing techniques and technology to take our ammonia and convert that to other  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:35):**  types of fertilizer that might be used in different places.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:39):**  And so the go to market strategy and the partners or the organization we might work with will  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:43):**  likely differ by the markets and the types of fertilizer that we're looking to support.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:49):**  And do you see either needing to be a practice change?  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:51):**  Can it fit into the existing channel and existing agronomic advice?  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:55):**  You actually produce the same thing that farmers would be using today?  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:59):**  We're still in an early stage of technology developments.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:01):**  We've still had a bit of flexibility in the form of the product that we get.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:04):**  But I do think that one of the things that we're likely to head towards is making a liquid  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:09):**  fertilizer much more readily than a dry fertilizer.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:12):**  And in fact, a lot of the dry fertilizers today are that way because that's easy to  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:18):**  transport and that's because they're made a long way from the point of use.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:22):**  And so we think that once you start making fertilizer closer to the point of use, some  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:26):**  of the reasons you might not use a liquid fertilizer are mitigated.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:31):**  And so the willingness to use liquid is greater.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:34):**  Having said that, we also see a lot of places where liquid fertilizer is used in increasing  
**[0:19:38-0:19:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:38):**  amounts.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:39):**  So we think that'll work better.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:40):**  But we think that our system will work much better in a liquid fertilizer environment.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:45):**  And from your perspective, is the fertilizer and agricultural industry interested in technologies  
**[0:19:51-0:19:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:51):**  like this and products like this?  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:52):**  Or is there some resistance?  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:53):**  Oh, look, I wish I had a dollar for every email or phone call I've been getting from  
**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:58):**  farmers who want one of our systems like right now.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:00):**  So we're getting a lot of inbound interest from people who recognize the importance of  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:05):**  decarbonization and welcome this idea that we can put some more control into their hands  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:10):**  over how they get their fertilizer.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:12):**  And so my only frustration is the speed at which I can scale up our technology and bring  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:16):**  it to market.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:17):**  And the need to pull carbon and other global warming chemicals out of the production chain  
**[0:20:24-0:20:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:24):**  is very widely recognized.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:25):**  And we're seeing a real appetite for solutions that can help address that challenge.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:31):**  As you think about new business models here, like decentralized production, local production,  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:35):**  and maybe even on farm production, how do you see the farm or the skills of farmers  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:40):**  and their teams needing to change in terms of being able to produce fertilizer locally  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:45):**  around these systems?  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:47):**  Yes, certainly there will need to be some changes in the ways that farmers use their  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:53):**  fertilizers, although as we know, there are plenty of farmers already who are using anhydrous  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:57):**  ammonia.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:58):**  So it's not like the skills that are required are unknown in the agriculture sector broadly.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:04):**  It's just that in particular markets or particular geographies, they may not be as well developed.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:08):**  So we need to share expertise and share knowledge around that.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:12):**  But again, the exciting thing for me is this idea that we can put more control back into  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:17):**  the hands of farmers and let them make choices about their fertilizer types that are really  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:23):**  more suited to their particular circumstances.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:26):**  So instead of them sitting at the end of a long supply chain from a centralized fertilizer  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:30):**  producer, where I guess they get a choice of products, but it's limited by what can  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:34):**  be delivered on farm at the time in the place that they need to a more decentralized solution,  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:40):**  which can be tailored much more to their particular circumstances.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:43):**  I think there's like an interesting tension, like how far do you sort of go?  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:46):**  Is it decentralized in the sense of local regional production, but there's still a company  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:50):**  that owns and operates it?  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:51):**  Or is it all the way on farm?  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:53):**  And I as a farmer now want to operate my own fertilizer factory?  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:56):**  I mean, imagine the answer is who knows?  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:58):**  And it depends.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:59):**  But how do you see that changing things?  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:02):**  We spent a lot of time thinking about that and trying to understand the various factors  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:06):**  that will influence that because clearly there is some technology factors.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:11):**  We're taking a technology from a lab bench scale.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:14):**  We ultimately need to go from making grams and kilograms up to making tons of ammonia.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:20):**  And along that journey, I'm sure that there'll be some things that will come up that will  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:24):**  either lend themselves more or less to a more decentralized model.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:29):**  But at the same time, there are those adoption issues and the sort of commercial issues around  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:34):**  who captures the value of those kinds of things.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:36):**  So we spent a lot of time working through different scenarios and thinking about how  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:41):**  that might play out.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:42):**  But we probably won't know until we actually get a bit further down the technology development  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:46):**  path because there are plenty of technology factors that play into that substantially.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:51):**  And what are or will be the biggest challenges to scaling the technology?  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:57):**  The thing that keeps me awake at night a little bit is if you look at the opportunity in green  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:03):**  ammonia, there's a sort of 200 million ton demand for ammonia today, most of which is  
**[0:23:08-0:23:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:08):**  for fertilizer.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:09):**  And out to 2050, we expect to see the world's population continue to grow.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:14):**  And whilst I'm excited to see some of the sort of fertilizer efficiency activities that  
**[0:23:19-0:23:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:19):**  are underway, I'm expecting that demand for ammonia will continue to grow out to 2050  
**[0:23:26-0:23:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:26):**  for its existing set of uses.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:27):**  But then there's a lot of interest across industry about using green ammonia in other  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:32):**  applications, including as a fuel.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:34):**  And so if you model that out to 2050, you can easily see an ammonia industry that is  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:39):**  three or four times its current scale.

**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:46):**  as we've built in the last hundred years to make ammonia.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:49):**  And that keeps me awake at night is how do we scale fast enough to meet that challenge?  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:52):**  How do we manufacture these units quickly enough to meet effectively the decarbonization  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:57):**  needs of the planet?  
**[0:23:59-0:24:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:59):**  And so we are ultimately building quite a modular solution.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:02):**  So we're thinking very much about how we can scale that up in a way that lends itself to  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:07):**  rapid manufacturing and rapid scale up.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:10):**  But it's a little bit like Tesla who were ahead of the curve with electric cars, and  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:14):**  now they can't make them fast enough.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:16):**  I think that in the next 10 years, you're going to see that demand for green ammonia  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:20):**  is such that we can't build green ammonia plants fast enough.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:24):**  As we think about the future of fertilizer, the technologies that companies like Jupiter  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:28):**  IONIX and Kula are aiming to bring forward offer some real alternatives for an industry  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:32):**  that's hungry for new solutions.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:35):**  But we're also well aware that this tech still has a lot of growing up to do.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:40):**  And in the meantime, farmers like Clay Govier, who opened up part one of this future of fertilizer  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:45):**  series, are dealing with exploding nitrogen prices right now.

**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:54):**  specialist for the Asia Pacific region at Trimble Agriculture, and Darian Walford, APAC  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:59):**  sales manager for Trimble Global Positioning, who offered a valuable on the ground perspective  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:04):**  of how farmers are tackling fertilizer challenges.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:07):**  Here's Jason.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:08):**  Ensuring the business continuity within the larger economic pressures that we're getting,  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:14):**  not only on fertilizer and fuel and things, it's something that keeps the guys I know  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:18):**  up at night.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:20):**  And previously, many of the farmers I know have had a recipe that works.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:25):**  And we just reuse that recipe many times over.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:29):**  And now the economics of that recipe have had to be analyzed quite significantly.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:34):**  Does it still work on the liters per hour that my machine is using?  
**[0:25:39-0:25:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:39):**  Does it still work with the cost of fertilizers?  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:41):**  And by the way, this is not the most expensive fertilizer we've ever had.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:45):**  But it's such a massive change in a short time that we haven't had time to fully absorb  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:51):**  the impacts that that has on our cost of production.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:53):**  And I was talking to a farmer not so long ago, maybe three, four weeks ago, he says  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:58):**  his return on investment on variable rate technologies has doubled because of the fertilizer  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:03):**  price.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:04):**  Whereas previously, he wasn't maybe so motivated to go through some of the pains to get himself  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:10):**  set up to get it done and get the zones and adopt software and then make sure the mission  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:15):**  machine has the right control system and talk to his local dealer and say, hey, what do  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:19):**  I need to do to convert this to be able to do that?  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:22):**  But now the returns right there, guys are talking 50 and $100,000 returns for a quite  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:28):**  a small addition in investment.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:30):**  And the accuracy stuff goes in the same boat.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:33):**  When you can save six inches on every pass, it adds up pretty quickly.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:38):**  And we know our farmers have been talking about that for a long time, but it's just  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:43):**  come really to the fore of conversation lately.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:46):**  There's a lot in farming that's about risk mitigation and putting your chips on this  
**[0:26:51-0:26:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:51):**  one this year and let's see how it goes.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:53):**  And risk in not changing.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:55):**  So if you stay with what we've always done, it will not provide the returns that you would  
**[0:27:03-0:27:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:03):**  expect this year.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:04):**  This is not the year to do what you did last year.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:07):**  And there's risk associated with not making a change.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:11):**  So as Jason was saying, you're making the effort into understanding what variable rate  
**[0:27:16-0:27:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:16):**  can do.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:17):**  The risk of not looking for those extra efficiencies when input costs are high.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:22):**  And a lot of farmers doing things to mitigate some risk by getting lots of parts and having  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:29):**  all the consumables they can get their hands on, getting hold of all the fertiliser they  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:33):**  can get their hands on.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:34):**  I think the grain price has allowed people to go hard on their programs and plan as much  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:39):**  as they can in most places.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:41):**  So there's returns available if things stay as they are.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:45):**  But if you continue to throw money at the back of your implement like you did before,  
**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:52):**  you're not going to realise any of that.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:53):**  And it's not so much, oh, you won't make a few more bob.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:57):**  The problem is you're actually wasting money this year.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:01):**  Over the last few weeks, we've been thinking a lot and hearing from many of you about the  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:05):**  challenges and opportunities in the nitrogen space, both on the science and the business  
**[0:28:09-0:28:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:09):**  front.

**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:14):**  to go and that most of the organisations and technologies, including the ones we've highlighted  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:19):**  here, still have plenty of commercial and technical work to do before they arrive at

**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:28):**  top.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:29):**  First, of all of the many go to market strategies that are possible in the fertiliser space,  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:34):**  I think that a distributed model that both Jupiter ionics and Kula are targeting in slightly  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:38):**  different ways is the most interesting.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:41):**  From a cost savings and efficiency standpoint, of course, given fertiliser economics rely  
**[0:28:46-0:28:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:46):**  on having the right product at the right place at the right time.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:50):**  And that needle is likely easier to thread if the fertiliser is made on farm, but also  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:54):**  from a climate impact perspective, using renewable energy or biology to actually produce the

**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:03):**  material all around the globe is even better, especially as scope three emissions concerns  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:08):**  grow within the value chain, this will be a huge benefit.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-part-2-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:12):**  Next, I appreciate Charlie's highlighting of the opportunity for customization that

### Agtech - So What?  (Thu, 30 May 2019 00:09:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:00:12):**  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:00:17):**  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:00:22):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:00:27):**  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  
**[0:00:31-0:00:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:00:31):**  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. Welcome back to the podcast. Today's episode  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:00:43):**  is our first on a new theme called Responding to Climate Risk, brought to you in partnership  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:00:49):**  with the Australian Farm Institute. We still have a few more episodes to go on our Getting  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:00:53):**  Ag Tech Ready theme in partnership with Decipher. So if you haven't checked those out, check  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:00:57):**  out our last two episodes with Tim Rethis and Maki Sutton, and stay tuned for a few  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:01:02):**  more there as well as more on this theme, Responding to Climate Risk. Our guest today  
**[0:01:07-0:01:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:01:07):**  is Annika Molesworth. Annika wears many hats. She's a researcher, speaker, writer, and farmer  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:01:14):**  in far western New South Wales. In our chat, we cover the realities and challenges of diversification  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:01:20):**  and Annika's experience with technologies and other practices that her family farm has  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:01:25):**  been using to respond to climate risk. We also talk about how Annika is using technology  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:01:30):**  to share her message and her family's story, and maybe most importantly, provide advice  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:01:35):**  for the next generation and for consumers around agricultural advocacy and voting with  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:01:41):**  your dollar. So here's Annika in our first episode on the Responding to Climate Risk  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:01:46):**  theme brought to you in partnership with the Australian Farm Institute.  
**[0:01:51-0:02:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:01:51):**  We're looking at how to recycle and revalue agricultural byproducts to improve soil fertility  
**[0:02:01-0:02:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:02:01):**  in irrigated cropping systems. So that means looking at animal manures, crop residues,  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:02:09):**  biochars, how that improves soil fertility, and then the yield and the quality of the  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:02:15):**  yield of crops like cotton and maize. And half of my study has been done in the Riverina  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:02:21):**  of New South Wales, and the other half of it has been done in Cambodia in Southeast  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:02:25):**  Asia. I am super excited to talk about the differences  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:02:30):**  and similarities between those two places. But before I do, what caused you to become  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:02:35):**  passionate about this topic? And I guess maybe more importantly, what caused you to decide  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:02:40):**  to really take action in the ways that you have around climate and climate change? Was  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:02:46):**  there like a moment that happened where you said, I have to do something about this?  
**[0:02:49-0:02:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:02:49):**  Yeah, actually there kind of was. So my family purchased our Outback Sheik station near Broken  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:02:57):**  Hill in the year 2000. And the year 2000 was the start of the decade-long Millennium Drought.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:03:04):**  So we had purchased this property, you know, this gorgeous, raw, stark landscape out in  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:03:10):**  far western New South Wales. We began designing what we were going to do out there, sort of  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:03:16):**  researching sheep in cattle markets, bush tucker foods, and then really encountered  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:03:22):**  10 years of little to no rainfall. So our introduction to agriculture was quite a steep  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:03:28):**  learning curve, and it became very quickly apparent to us just how interconnected different  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:03:33):**  components of the farming system are. And as we all know, when the rain stops falling,  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:03:39):**  less vegetation grows, livestock are sold at reduced weight, crop yields are not achieved,  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:03:45):**  less money in the farmer's pocket means they search for off-farm employment. We see shops  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:03:50):**  and schools and rural towns close. And then for the consumers in urban environments, we  
**[0:03:55-0:04:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:03:55):**  see food prices go up and food quality go down. So that really made me so aware, okay,  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:04:02):**  we are in this really complex but interconnected web here. What we are doing on farm, you know,  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:04:09):**  in these remote parts of Australia, has impacts to all aspects of society. It impacts everyone  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:04:16):**  who eats food and wears clothes. So with this knowledge that this part of Australia was  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:04:22):**  become hotter and drier due to climate change, that we would experience more frequent and  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:04:28):**  intense droughts and dust storms, I became, you know, very conscious, okay, well, how  
**[0:04:33-0:04:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:04:33):**  am I going to upskill myself to take on my family farm and front up to these big challenges?  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:04:41):**  Wow, that must have been quite an experience for you and your family at that time. Had  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:04:46):**  you guys been on different farming properties before or was this a first foray into agriculture  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:04:50):**  wholesale and this all happened? Like what's a little bit of the backstory there?  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:04:55):**  We came from Melbourne, so we were very much city slickers. My parents had backgrounds  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:05:00):**  in environment. So they, you know, always had this desire to buy a farm one day and  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:05:06):**  we would, you know, dabble in farming. And, you know, we ended up with 10,000 acres in  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:05:11):**  far western New South Wales, you know, in the semi arid heartland of Australia, which  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:05:16):**  is arguably some of the most challenging and fragile regions of the country. So we had  
**[0:05:23-0:05:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:05:23):**  to learn very quickly about our environment, about the impact we as farmers put, you know,  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:05:32):**  on that environment, what we ask of it, how we are going to look after it the best way  
**[0:05:38-0:05:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:05:38):**  possible, how can we be the best land managers, understanding all the science, you know, doing  
**[0:05:46-0:05:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:05:46):**  our homework, trying to learn as much as we can. So we were the best food producers possible  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:05:53):**  for that property.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:05:55):**  Wow. So what was that like? Like I think one of the things I read about you was that at  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:06:02):**  some point you guys decided to, you had to take action and actually do something different  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:06:06):**  on the station to presumably deal with the drought. Is that, was that driving the decision  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:06:11):**  to convert to organic and look at different genetics or did that decision come from somewhere  
**[0:06:17-0:06:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:06:17):**  else?  
**[0:06:18-0:06:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:06:18):**  Yeah, so the drought opened our eyes and opened our mind to a variety of things. It highlighted  
**[0:06:27-0:06:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:06:27):**  how fragile this region is and really made us look inside, you know, what can we do to,  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:06:36):**  you know, farm sustainably for the future. And so we did a few things really. We set  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:06:43):**  up conservation reserves where we had identified rare and threatened species on the property  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:06:49):**  because we want to make sure their protection and regeneration. So we fenced them off to  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:06:54):**  prevent grazing. We, you know, it's a very water scarce environment out there in far  
**[0:07:00-0:07:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:07:00):**  Western New South Wales. So we established dams and tried to improve our water security.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:07:07):**  And then, yeah, we looked at what livestock species or varieties are suitable for that  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:07:13):**  region. And 10 years, sorry, 20 years ago when we purchased the property, many people  
**[0:07:18-0:07:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:07:18):**  in the region were farming hereford cattle, marinos. And we were one of the first ones  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:07:26):**  to adopt African sheep. So Damara sheep. And then we slowly converted into Dorper sheep.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:07:33):**  So these African sheep, they come from a similar semi-arid environment. They're extremely drought  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:07:39):**  tolerant and hardy to high temperatures. They have a high birthing rate. So they were very  
**[0:07:46-0:07:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:07:46):**  well suited. We were also harvesting rangeland goats, which are the wild goats, which just  
**[0:07:53-0:08:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:07:53):**  wander around far Western New South Wales. The organic side of things, because far Western  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:08:00):**  New South Wales is naturally hot and dry. There is very little pests and diseases out  
**[0:08:06-0:08:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:08:06):**  there and worming problems and things like that. So we were organic by default, so to  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:08:13):**  speak. We weren't drenching or worming our livestock. So we decided we would make that  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:08:19):**  more official. We would go down the organics pathway, get our certification. At that point  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:08:26):**  when we did it, it's quite a timely and costly process. It took about three years for us  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:08:32):**  to go through the auditing and all the procedures to get our certification. And then it was  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:08:38):**  also quite costly to actually maintain that certification. And because we are so remote,  
**[0:08:45-0:08:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:08:45):**  we're actually not a terribly large property for that region. We weren't covering the expenses  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:08:53):**  of holding that organic certification. So we then ended up giving it up after a few  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:08:58):**  years. So although we still run on organic-based principles, we don't have the piece of paper  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:09:03):**  saying we are officially organic. So you've traveled around the world. You mentioned your  
**[0:09:09-0:09:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:09:09):**  PhD before and work in Southeast Asia. Tell me a little bit about the lessons maybe or  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:09:16):**  insights you're seeing for farmers in the Riverino or in Australia more broadly from  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:09:21):**  farmers in Southeast Asia or vice versa. Are there things that one side can learn from  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:09:26):**  another, whether that's practices or technologies or what may have you?  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:09:31):**  Incredibly interesting. I mean, many of these farmers that I was working with, they had  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:09:35):**  had no formal education and no formal education in climate change definitely, but they absolutely  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:09:42):**  knew their environment and their land so well that they could describe to me the number  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:09:49):**  of days that the dry season is extending each year. They could describe to me the insects  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:09:54):**  that they're seeing eating their crops, which they had never seen before. So they knew so  
**[0:09:59-0:10:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:09:59):**  acutely how their environment and their world was changing. And they were so eager to learn  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:10:07):**  how to deal with this. And how, like, I imagine you'd characterize  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:10:12):**  the farmers in the Riverino quite differently for a number of obvious reasons, but in terms  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:10:16):**  of awareness of climate, do you find the same kinds of things?  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:10:21):**  Look, I think because any farmer works and lives so closely with the environment, they  
**[0:10:27-0:10:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:10:27):**  are the first to feel the changes in their land, in their vegetation, in water availability.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:10:36):**  So I think it's undeniable that farmers right across Australia and the world are feeling  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:10:42):**  the impacts of a changing climate, whether someone to attribute that to human induced  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:10:48):**  climate change or not is a different matter. But definitely in Australia over the last  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:10:54):**  decade, the conversation has absolutely changed and changed for the better. We're not seeing  
**[0:11:00-0:11:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:11:00):**  in the media the words like belief and debate anymore. It's very much about what strategies  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:11:07):**  we need to be putting in place now. We need to ensure that there's national agricultural  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:11:13):**  adaptation strategies put in place today. We're talking about climate and energy policies.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:11:19):**  And that's the conversations we absolutely need to be having.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:11:23):**  In a couple of your talks and things, you talk about fragmentation. And is that what  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:11:26):**  you mean the kind of polarized conversation? Probably more broadly is when I've been talking  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:11:32):**  about fragmentation. It's more that, say in Australia, and a global trend also, but in  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:11:38):**  Australia, you know, a huge percent of our population are an urban dwelling population.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:11:44):**  Farmers make up only 1% of Australia's population, yet we provide 93% of the food consumed here.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:11:52):**  But when we've got a largely urban population who are becoming further disconnected from  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:11:57):**  the people who grow their food and their fiber, they become further disconnected from the  
**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:12:03):**  challenges that the farmers face also. Recently, I was in Sydney giving a presentation and  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:12:10):**  someone, you know, a well-meaning person apologized to me for the rain that we were having in  
**[0:12:15-0:12:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:12:15):**  Sydney. And it sort of took me by surprise a bit because we're in the middle of a terrible  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:12:22):**  drought in rural Australia. You know, we haven't had decent rain for years and years and we're  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:12:28):**  absolutely feeling those impacts on my family's farm at the moment. But it just highlighted  
**[0:12:33-0:12:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:12:33):**  how disconnected people have become from our natural environment. And also that larger  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:12:42):**  understanding of, okay, when the rain doesn't fall, that actually impacts the food that  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:12:48):**  you're going to eat at the end of the day and, you know, everyone who plays a role across  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:12:53):**  that entire food system.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:12:55):**  Definitely. Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And so obviously there are, I guess, two angles  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:13:01):**  here around technology. One being how do we overcome that fragmentation through technology?  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:13:07):**  And that's a lot of the work that you're doing through videos and speaking and having influence  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:13:11):**  despite living in a remote place and using technology. So I want to come back to that.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:13:16):**  But the other angle would be actual technologies that farmers can adopt to help be more climate  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:13:22):**  resilient and farm sustainably despite the changing climate. Can you talk a little bit  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:13:28):**  about any ag tech innovations that have maybe sparked your interest in relation to managing  
**[0:13:33-0:13:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:13:33):**  the impacts of climate change?  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:13:35):**  Yeah, well, I'll touch on the first point you made first in terms of like communicating  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:13:40):**  the story of what's happening. And yeah, you're very right in saying that's something that  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:13:44):**  I've become very interested in how to actually, you know, bridge that urban rural divide and  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:13:50):**  actually reconnect people to the food systems and the people who grow their food. And that's  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:13:56):**  something I've been doing online on social media platforms, you know, recording videos  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:14:02):**  of myself posting articles, writing blogs and trying to engage people because the farming  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:14:08):**  sector has such such an incredible, beautiful story to share. We live in these fantastic  
**[0:14:15-0:14:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:14:15):**  landscapes. We live with such such a rich community sometimes. You know, there's this  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:14:24):**  this wonderful story that we as farmers can actually tell people, you know, tell them  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:14:29):**  about how important this soil is and all these incredible microbes and fungi and bacteria  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:14:35):**  that lives in this soil and how that helps our plants grow and turn, you know, nutrients  
**[0:14:41-0:14:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:14:41):**  into nutrients that people can consume. And then, you know, relate that to the wider,  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:14:48):**  the larger picture of, you know, the importance of rainfall and flowing rivers and looking  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:14:54):**  after those river systems. So that's something I've been working with, you know, both by  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:14:59):**  myself individually, through my platform, Climate Wise Agriculture, and through other  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:15:04):**  groups like the Young Farming Champions and Farmers for Climate Action, really trying  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:15:09):**  to amplify the voice of farmers in rural Australia and get these messages in the press. So in  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:15:15):**  regards to communication technology, I think that's one really exciting place at the moment  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:15:21):**  and something that's just opening up rural Australia to everyone else.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:15:25):**  Yeah. Before you go on to the more kind of on farm tech point, I do want to discuss this  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:15:30):**  a little bit. So I guess one, like the work you're doing is truly amazing and I totally  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:15:35):**  agree with everything you've said. One potential, I guess, push back around that could be, that's  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:15:39):**  a lot of work. Like if I'm a farmer and I'm busy farming, I don't also want to have to  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:15:44):**  get on social media and tell these stories. Like, so what would your response to something  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:15:48):**  like that be around the kind of, that's a lot of work and why would I have to do that?  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:15:54):**  And is that something that you think farmers really should be taking on in addition to  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:15:58):**  producing food? Yeah. Look, I think the farmers, I know they  
**[0:16:03-0:16:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:16:03):**  take, they have such pride for what they do and such love for their landscapes and the  
**[0:16:11-0:16:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:16:11):**  food they produce to high quality. When I meet a farmer and ask them about, oh, how's  
**[0:16:18-0:16:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:16:18):**  the crop growing? And I get a 30 minute response to that. Farmers really do love talking about  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:16:28):**  their animals, their crops, the rain, the weather and all of this. So I think the farmers  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:16:34):**  naturally have that great story telling ability and that desire to share with people what  
**[0:16:41-0:16:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:16:41):**  they do and why they're doing it. And I think now actually making sure farmers have the  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:16:48):**  skills to access these platforms and tell that story, not just over the fence to the  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:16:54):**  neighbor, but actually to a wider audience, to an audience that really wants to hear about  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:17:00):**  where their food comes from. I think that's really exciting.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:17:04):**  What kinds of ideas or technologies have you seen or innovations more broadly that are  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:17:12):**  helping farmers to manage climate risk or adapt to climate change on farm? Ones that  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:17:15):**  you've mentioned are kind of energy technologies. Are there others or do you want to dig in  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:17:20):**  more to that that you would say, this is really going to be part of the solution?  
**[0:17:24-0:17:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:17:24):**  Yeah. Okay. Well, on my family's farm, so in regards to climate change adaptation and  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:17:33):**  mitigation of emissions. So in terms of adaptation, like I mentioned, we observe some rare and  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:17:39):**  threatened species. So we set up conservation reserves. So these conservation reserves are  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:17:45):**  around some Eucalyptus scilii, which is curly leaf mallee. Now these trees have been dated  
**[0:17:50-0:17:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:17:50):**  to be around 800 to 900 years old on our property. And we noticed that there's no new seedlings  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:17:58):**  of these trees. And that really raised concern for us. What has changed in our environment  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:18:04):**  so drastically that these trees that have lived for nearly a thousand years old are  
**[0:18:08-0:18:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:18:08):**  bringing on no new generation? So we're working hard at actually protecting these species,  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:18:16):**  raising awareness of these species that are incredibly vulnerable because we don't want  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:18:21):**  to lose biodiversity. So that's something we're doing. We've established renewable energy,  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:18:28):**  solar panels on our homestead roof. So we're using green energy to pump water to distant  
**[0:18:34-0:18:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:18:34):**  troughs to sheep in the paddocks, to use solar energy to run our houses and all our electricity.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:18:46):**  What else were we doing? Yeah, the genetics of the African sheep. We've also partnered  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:18:54):**  with universities because we're very interested in learning from scientists as much as we  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:19:00):**  can about our property, our soils, our water, our vegetation, so we can best manage it.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:19:06):**  So the university is doing a series of climate change studies on our farm, which is incredibly  
**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:19:13):**  interesting. Yeah, one thing that strikes me is that some of those technologies and  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:19:19):**  innovations sound like they could cost money and probably do cost money. And you've said  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:19:24):**  before that technology, it's not about technology, it's not about money, it's not about knowledge,  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:19:30):**  it's more about policy. Do you maybe talk a little bit about how you see us enabling  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:19:35):**  everyone to adopt some of these practices and technologies? Because I imagine for some  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:19:39):**  it's cost prohibitive or the kind of worse before better dynamic is just too strong.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:19:45):**  Yeah, well focusing on say renewable energy as an example. Farmers are very positive about  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:19:54):**  renewable energies and being a part of the solution here because Australia, it is the  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:19:59):**  sunniest and one of the windiest continents on earth. There is just so much potential  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:20:05):**  for renewable energies to be powering our businesses and also providing farmers with  
**[0:20:11-0:20:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:20:11):**  secondary and stable sources of income if they are the ones to host solar plants and  
**[0:20:18-0:20:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:20:18):**  wind turbines. Farmers have these great expanses of land. Let them not only feed and clothe  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:20:25):**  the world but help power it as well. So I think that's a really exciting place that  
**[0:20:30-0:20:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:20:30):**  we can be looking in agriculture and looking at ways to make sure that there are really  
**[0:20:37-0:20:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:20:37):**  good policies and regulations and strategies in place to allow farmers to play a part in  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:20:45):**  the solutions to help with this new green energy production.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:20:51):**  Do you give a lot of weight to the opportunity for premium brands and differentiating whether  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:20:58):**  it's Brand Australia or actual brands, clean green, growing middle class in Asia, etc.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:21:03):**  Do you see that as part of the solution to climate resilience either from a financial  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:21:08):**  standpoint or practices that differentiate and how do you see that playing out?  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:21:13):**  Yeah, absolutely. That could play a really important role. I mean Aussie farmers are  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:21:17):**  some of the best farmers in the world in the ways that we do produce food and fibre and  
**[0:21:22-0:21:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:21:22):**  something that Australian farmers are incredibly proud of. Having some sort of labelling system  
**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:21:29):**  or some sort of system that actually says this is what we're doing in terms of energy  
**[0:21:36-0:21:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:21:36):**  and water use and all of that to actually put a stamp of this is how clean and green  
**[0:21:43-0:21:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:21:43):**  we actually are. That could be a really good marketing point and really encourage people  
**[0:21:51-0:21:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:21:51):**  to step up and really produce high environmental standard food and fibres.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:21:59):**  So I wanted to just jump all the way back to the work in Asia versus the work in the  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:22:05):**  Riverina. Why those two places and are you looking at different policies or technologies  
**[0:22:10-0:22:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:22:10):**  or practices that you can compare across them or how do those two things fit together?  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:22:18):**  What I'm looking at with my PhD is how to recycle and revalue agricultural byproducts.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:22:23):**  So in Southeast Asia, these smallholder farmers, they usually grow rice in the wet season for  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:22:31):**  six months of the year when there's lots of rainfall and then they've got the dry season  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:22:35):**  where they get very little rainfall and they struggle to grow their dry season crops, be  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:22:40):**  that maize or peanuts or things like that. And they often have a few livestock in the  
**[0:22:47-0:22:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:22:47):**  field as well. And what these smallholder farmers do particularly well is to recycle  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:22:55):**  those livestock manures, put that into the soil to improve the crop growth, those crop  
**[0:23:01-0:23:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:23:01):**  residues after harvest are then fed back to the livestock as feed. So it's very cyclical.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:23:08):**  There's very little wasted of nutrients and resources. In the Australian system where  
**[0:23:15-0:23:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:23:15):**  we have become much larger scale, we've moved away from that traditional farming practice  
**[0:23:23-0:23:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:23:23):**  of using agricultural byproducts. We've moved away from using animal manures and crop residues  
**[0:23:30-0:23:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:23:30):**  as organic fertilizers and soil amendments. But because synthetic or inorganic fertilizers  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:23:40):**  are becoming increasingly expensive, because more research is revealing some of the problems  
**[0:23:46-0:23:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:23:46):**  they cause, when there's too much nutrients added to the soil and that's being lost into  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:23:53):**  waterways and things like that, there's a lot of interest in returning to those organic  
**[0:23:59-0:24:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:23:59):**  amendments. Take it for the Riverina, poultry production is very large and also cotton production  
**[0:24:07-0:24:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:24:07):**  is very large. So my research was looking at if we collected the manure from the poultry  
**[0:24:13-0:24:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:24:13):**  sheds and applied that to the cotton fields, do we get just as good yield and quality of  
**[0:24:21-0:24:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:24:21):**  fiber from the cotton if we were to use inorganic fertilizers. And the research so far is showing  
**[0:24:29-0:24:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:24:29):**  that it's pretty comparable that when these nutrients are applied at the same rate, that  
**[0:24:38-0:24:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:24:38):**  we are getting just as good yields and quality of crop when we are using those organic manure  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:24:45):**  fertilizers. You challenge everyone to take responsibility and you do that in a lot of  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:24:51):**  ways both explicitly in things like your TED talk, but also in the work you do more implicitly  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:24:56):**  in the responsibility that you take. Two angles there just quickly before we wrap up, what  
**[0:25:02-0:25:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:25:02):**  do you think the role of farmers are in taking responsibility and what's the role of consumers?  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:25:10):**  And I guess I mean quite specifically, so yes, voting with your dollar makes sense,  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:25:14):**  but what does that actually look like for consumers and what do farmers need to be doing  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:25:19):**  to take responsibility as well? And yeah, how do you see that?  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:25:23):**  Yeah, so look, my belief is that we're all responsible for our common home, for this  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:25:29):**  planet. We all have an impact upon it. We are all accountable for our actions and we  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:25:36):**  don't get anywhere by pointing our fingers to someone else or another group and saying,  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:25:40):**  you know, you guys are causing the problem, you guys have to fix it. I think that we all  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:25:45):**  need to step up, we all need to, you know, channel our inner leader and go, okay, well,  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:25:51):**  how am I going to make a difference? Maybe I can't change the world, but maybe I can  
**[0:25:56-0:26:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:25:56):**  change my world. And so that's when I ask people to find ways to help drive positive  
**[0:26:03-0:26:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:26:03):**  change, because the enormity of the problems we are facing, the scale of the changes we  
**[0:26:10-0:26:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:26:10):**  are seeing, and by that I'm referring to, we have a rapidly growing global population,  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:26:17):**  we need to be producing more food with reduced environmental footprint on the backdrop of  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:26:22):**  social change and climate change. How does each and every one of us step up to the plate?  
**[0:26:28-0:26:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:26:28):**  And three ways I think people can do that is by using, you know, your consumer influence,  
**[0:26:35-0:26:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:26:35):**  your political influence and your social influence. So by using your consumer influence, we drive  
**[0:26:42-0:26:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:26:42):**  markets and when we demand products with high environmental, social, ethical standards,  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:26:50):**  then the producers, the suppliers of those goods and services, they have to step up or  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:26:54):**  they get left behind. So I encourage people to, you know, put their money towards goods  
**[0:27:00-0:27:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:27:00):**  and services that are doing right by the planet. When I refer to using your political influence,  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:27:09):**  it's about being informed where politicians and parties stand on environmental issues,  
**[0:27:15-0:27:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:27:15):**  but also asking them that, you know, we need strong and ambitious climate and energy and  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:27:22):**  environmental policies. You know, no matter what the party, these issues are not political  
**[0:27:27-0:27:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:27:27):**  footballs. So we demand better. And then lastly, using your social influence, that's about  
**[0:27:34-0:27:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:27:34):**  amplifying your voice. It's about talking to people, getting these issues on people's  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:27:41):**  radar, working with groups, you know, making a difference on the ground. And there are  
**[0:27:46-0:27:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:27:46):**  just so many ways as we spoke about earlier, that you can amplify your own voice by using  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:27:52):**  the social media channels, by writing blogs, by talking on the radio, by doing podcasts  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:27:58):**  like this, by getting the messages out there, both the challenges that we are experiencing,  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:28:04):**  but more importantly, the solutions that are out there.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:28:08):**  Love it. One, I guess, clarification question, and I promised I wouldn't ask another, but  
**[0:28:12-0:28:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:28:12):**  I've lied. There's lots of confusion out there about labels and a lot of people and brands  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:28:19):**  trying to market that they're, you know, environmentally friendly or we only have this many pens per  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:28:24):**  hectare or whatever. And I think it's really hard even for people who want to make good  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:28:29):**  choices to distinguish. Do you have any thoughts on that or any advice?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:28:34):**  Yeah, it is challenging. I totally agree. You go to the supermarket and you're bombarded  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:28:40):**  with all these labels and decisions and you just want to get out of the aisle at the end  
**[0:28:44-0:28:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:28:44):**  of the day. So look, there's a lot of resources online these days. I mean, we are so lucky  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:28:52):**  that we're living in a time where we can access so much information. You know, obviously there's  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:28:57):**  got to a point where there's probably too much information and you just feel overwhelmed.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:29:02):**  But if you can sit down and sort of inform yourself of where brands, where organizations  
**[0:29:08-0:29:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:29:08):**  stand in their social, environmental responsibility and try and make well-informed decisions where  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:29:16):**  you can, then that's the best way. Fair enough. Yes, we got to do our homework  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:29:21):**  and hopefully we can make those decisions easier and make the, like we said before,  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:29:26):**  the practices that are worth rewarding more easily rewardable in various ways, technology  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=378116#t=0:29:32):**  or otherwise. Well, Annika, thank you so much for joining me on the podcast. I really appreciate

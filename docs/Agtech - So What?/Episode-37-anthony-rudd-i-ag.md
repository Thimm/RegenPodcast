### Agtech - So What?  (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 12:57:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly changing  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:00:25):**  the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting started.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:00:30):**  But there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between ag and  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:00:35):**  ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring you the  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:00:39):**  story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where ag and tech  
**[0:00:44-0:00:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:00:44):**  meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:00:59):**  My name is Sarah Nolet from Agthentic. Today's chat is with Anthony Rudd. He works for a  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:01:06):**  company called iAg out in the Griffith area of New South Wales, where I was fortunate  
**[0:01:11-0:01:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:01:11):**  enough to visit a couple weeks ago. This conversation, I had a bit of an experiment. I just called  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:01:18):**  Anthony and then hit record and we just started chatting. So we then did a bit of editing  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:01:23):**  over to kind of cut out some parts and help shave it into something for you guys, the  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:01:28):**  listeners. So a bit different than the kind of normal, straightforward question and answer  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:01:32):**  format just that a bit more of a chat. But hopefully it's really valuable. I loved hearing  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:01:38):**  from Anthony's experience. He's worked in the Precision Ag space for a long time and  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:01:41):**  really understands both the technology side and how hard it is to build technology, but  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:01:47):**  also the grower side and some of the challenges around adoption and just getting started with  
**[0:01:53-0:02:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:01:53):**  how to make use out of data in this space, which is not an easy thing yet, unfortunately.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:02:01):**  So I hope you enjoy this conversation with Anthony as much as I did.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:02:09):**  Hello.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:02:10):**  G'day. How are you?  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:02:12):**  Hey, I'm well. How are you?  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:02:15):**  I'm good.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:02:16):**  Super casual in the home office, which is good.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:02:19):**  I do it every day.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:02:20):**  Yes. Oh, every day you work from home.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:02:23):**  Yeah. Yeah. And I hate this time of year because I spent a lot of time in the office and I'm  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:02:27):**  sick of being here.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:02:28):**  Oh, so you want to get out and do stuff?  
**[0:02:31-0:02:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:02:31):**  I do. Yes. I only got a couple of weeks to go and you won't see me. So once we start  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:02:39):**  getting close into cotton pick and lots of stuff will be a lot more hectic.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:02:44):**  Yeah, right. Tell me about that. What do you do during cotton pick?  
**[0:02:49-0:02:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:02:49):**  So generally we've got, last year we managed about 40 different pickers, contractors and  
**[0:02:56-0:03:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:02:56):**  just growers. And so we ensure that they've got some data standardization happening and  
**[0:03:06-0:03:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:03:06):**  we import a lot of field boundaries into My John Deere. And then normally what we do is  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:03:15):**  a master file. So we create a master file that goes into either their picker or their  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:03:19):**  contractors picker, which has all their field names and field boundaries, hectares and so  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:03:25):**  forth. So it just makes it a lot easier for everybody to manage their own data. Yeah.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:03:31):**  Right.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:03:32):**  It's just a funny setup with John Deere. So I don't know whether you know much about cotton  
**[0:03:37-0:03:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:03:37):**  and the gin, but the pickers generate a module, so to speak. That's those big round yellow  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:03:47):**  bales.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:03:48):**  Yep.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:03:49):**  And they're all individually RFID tagged. So the picker actually generates just a normal  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:03:59):**  text file that has a list of all the fields and all the modules that were picked in that  
**[0:04:06-0:04:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:04:06):**  field. So when the modules go back across the way bridge at the gin, they've actually  
**[0:04:13-0:04:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:04:13):**  already got those farms and fields in their system. So the RFID reader just recognizes  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:04:21):**  where that module came from. So which grower it was, which farm it came from, and which  
**[0:04:27-0:04:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:04:27):**  field it came from. And then that data then is once everything's picked and it's available  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:04:36):**  in its text form, it'll go to the gin just for some cross-referencing. And then they  
**[0:04:43-0:04:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:04:43):**  can actually, what they can do then is it'll work out how many bales came from each module.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:04:52):**  And then we can see where each module was picked in a field. And you combine that with  
**[0:04:58-0:05:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:04:58):**  your yield map, you get a pretty good picture of how the field performed once you combine  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:05:06):**  that obviously with your gin data and your turnout and so forth.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:05:09):**  Right. And when you say this whole system, is this a combination of different providers  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:05:15):**  and need someone like you to set it all up or is this one kind of thing?  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:05:20):**  It's one thing, but it's a combination of different users.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:05:25):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:05:26):**  So from grower, contractor to gins. So over the last few years, especially with three  
**[0:05:33-0:05:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:05:33):**  new gins here, we spent a lot of time training gin staff. So the My John Deere website allows  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:05:43):**  for a lot of data sharing. So what's actually happening is data has been created in real  
**[0:05:50-0:06:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:05:50):**  time and the gin's receiving that data wirelessly, practically instantaneously. So data they've  
**[0:06:00-0:06:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:06:00):**  got there before modules turn up makes it easier.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:06:07):**  So I want to back up and ask some one-on-one stuff just about you and Nyagan. And then  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:06:15):**  I imagine, I mean, I could ask about that stuff all day, but probably help start at  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:06:20):**  the beginning. No, I mean, I literally could just go down a rabbit hole of questions and  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:06:24):**  that's maybe not a good idea. So yeah, I might just ask, I mean, some of this stuff's basic,  
**[0:06:31-0:06:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:06:31):**  but just have you tell us a little bit about who you are and how you got involved in this  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:06:38):**  and kind of your background or origin story.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:06:42):**  Yeah. So back in 2008, I started with the local or the Griffith John Deere dealership  
**[0:06:52-0:07:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:06:52):**  as the very first integrated solutions manager in Australia, which was interesting.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:07:00):**  Were there ones in other countries, but just not Australia?  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:07:04):**  Yeah. The concept was extremely new and it had been tested extensively, I think in the  
**[0:07:09-0:07:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:07:09):**  States from what I recollect. I think there was an appointment of me and probably half  
**[0:07:16-0:07:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:07:16):**  a dozen other positions across the country in specific dealerships. So integrated solutions  
**[0:07:26-0:07:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:07:26):**  was really the joining of tech to the dealership and to the grower. So John Deere obviously  
**[0:07:36-0:07:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:07:36):**  had a fairly extensive business model that focused around integrated solutions or tech  
**[0:07:44-0:07:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:07:44):**  solutions for growers. And we, I suppose they needed to move beyond just pure guidance,  
**[0:07:55-0:08:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:07:55):**  GPS guidance and moving into machine automation and into data collection and data generation.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:08:05):**  So technology sort of changed extremely rapidly for those first two or three years within  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:08:14):**  the dealership, they needed somebody to, or a department to join all those different departments  
**[0:08:20-0:08:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:08:20):**  together. So joining sales and service and parts back into that integrated solutions  
**[0:08:28-0:08:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:08:28):**  scenario. So training was available for the staff members on new product, new tech, new  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:08:38):**  software. And that was across the board. And obviously when there's new software, there's  
**[0:08:45-0:08:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:08:45):**  new hardware. And so parts came into play there and also service and sales of who are  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:08:52):**  obviously selling the new product.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:08:55):**  When you were doing that, sorry to interrupt you, in that role, was that for one dealer  
**[0:09:00-0:09:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:09:00):**  or were you working across those?  
**[0:09:02-0:09:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:09:02):**  No, that was purely for ANG machinery in Griffith. Because what had happened is John Deere had  
**[0:09:13-0:09:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:09:13):**  just changed their business model, their structure a little, and they introduced some tech phasing  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:09:20):**  or some dealership phasing. So you had to actually achieve some certain levels of knowledge  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:09:26):**  before you were actually allowed to sell certain types of products. Some of those products  
**[0:09:32-0:09:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:09:32):**  were implement guidance and iGrave, which is some land forming software. So that was  
**[0:09:44-0:09:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:09:44):**  sort of the beginning. And then I spent sort of five or six years there until the new owners  
**[0:09:52-0:09:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:09:52):**  took over. And when I had developed a heap of really good relationships with a lot of  
**[0:09:59-0:10:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:09:59):**  growers and I didn't want to lose them. And so I sort of thought, well, gee, what have  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:10:06):**  we... And we also noticed that there were some massive gaps in that space at that time  
**[0:10:12-0:10:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:10:12):**  anyway. And I also saw a lot of growers struggle, get frustrated, just keeping up with tech  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:10:22):**  and ideas and battling with social media and other sort of media outlets telling them you  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:10:28):**  should be doing this and lots of other new players coming into the market as well. So  
**[0:10:32-0:10:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:10:32):**  it was really, really... And still is a really difficult sort of space to navigate for the  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:10:40):**  poor old growers. So we thought we might've been able to help in that space and probably  
**[0:10:47-0:10:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:10:47):**  try and actually develop a little bit of software that might help along the way. So that was  
**[0:10:56-0:11:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:10:56):**  sort of the beginning of a company we called Etad Data. Then I got tied up with a Chinese  
**[0:11:05-0:11:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:11:05):**  company building a transfer station just out at Wumblegal near Griffith. They were the  
**[0:11:12-0:11:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:11:12):**  first people in the world to actually export cotton in its raw form, so un-ginned. And  
**[0:11:22-0:11:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:11:22):**  that was quite challenging for sort of 12 or 18 months trying to get things done through  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:11:30):**  government departments and like all. So I learned a lot more about cotton itself during  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:11:34):**  that time. And we developed some software to track their modules through the transfer  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:11:40):**  station and obviously in the containers and across to China.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:11:45):**  So this was all as that second business, this is outside of the John Deere world.  
**[0:11:52-0:12:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:11:52):**  Yeah, this is just me as myself. Yeah. I actually became a government authorized inspection  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:12:00):**  officer for cotton for export as well. So that was just part of something we had to  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:12:06):**  do, a gap we had to fill.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:12:08):**  I feel like there's a number of leaps here from you just casually say, and then I started  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:12:13):**  a company and then we built software and then I exported to China.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:12:17):**  It sort of was a bit like that. It was an interesting time. There was a changeover of  
**[0:12:26-0:12:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:12:26):**  obviously the ownership of that John Deere business, which is quite large in the region.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:12:34):**  But I also had all these growers ringing me saying, what can I do here? How am I going  
**[0:12:39-0:12:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:12:39):**  to fix this? Can you give me some advice here? And it really just snowballed a little bit  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:12:50):**  from there.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:12:51):**  What was the common, sorry, I keep interrupting you, but what was the common question? Was  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:12:56):**  it like a specific, I can't get this thing to talk to this thing or was it like, I'm  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:13:00):**  hearing all about this stuff. Where do I start? Or what were they asking?  
**[0:13:03-0:13:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:13:03):**  It was a quite a large range. But the common theme mainly was I've bought this piece of  
**[0:13:11-0:13:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:13:11):**  equipment. The dealer and the salesman told me it would do this and it doesn't. We can't  
**[0:13:20-0:13:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:13:20):**  get it to work. And so there's a lot of investigation goes into those sorts of scenarios and it  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:13:28):**  becomes a trial and error. And because a lot of the tech was really new, it couldn't get  
**[0:13:33-0:13:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:13:33):**  much help from the dealer or the reseller. And there was lots of attempts to try and  
**[0:13:42-0:13:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:13:42):**  uptake some tech, but also generate some data and create some usage for it that failed miserably.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:13:52):**  Just due purely to the lack of knowledge and lack of knowledge on both parts. So lack of  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:13:58):**  knowledge from the grower and also lack of knowledge from the reseller. So the grower  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:14:03):**  really didn't, once again, we just go in blind and we believe what our salesman tells us.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:14:09):**  And he obviously believes what he's telling you, but he might not be fully aware of what's  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:14:13):**  going on. And I had a really good insight into this when I worked with A&G machinery  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:14:18):**  with John Deere and that was a massive issue. So it really made it.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:14:24):**  Tell me about that. It's funny, right? At some point someone knows and then it gets  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:14:29):**  passed down the chain and someone doesn't know anymore. How does that actually... Is  
**[0:14:33-0:14:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:14:33):**  it an organizational thing or a tech thing or...  
**[0:14:36-0:14:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:14:36):**  It's definitely... It's an organizational thing and it's a cultural thing. So probably  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:14:44):**  if you look at the model of the modern salesman, machinery salesman who gets paid to sell big  
**[0:14:51-0:14:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:14:51):**  ticket items in machinery and gets paid a commission to do that. But when you're looking  
**[0:14:59-0:15:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:14:59):**  at the backend tech stuff, so if you're looking at application controllers and just screens  
**[0:15:07-0:15:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:15:07):**  and GPS gear, there's not a huge amount of money in it. So if I'm a sales person and  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:15:15):**  I'm looking at a commission from a sale of this big tractor of being so many thousands  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:15:21):**  of dollars and commission from the sale of this little bit of AMS hardware and software,  
**[0:15:27-0:15:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:15:27):**  I'm probably going to focus on the tractor sale rather than on the software sale. And  
**[0:15:35-0:15:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:15:35):**  plus look, I take my hat off to machinery sales people to do that job and to know the  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:15:43):**  product that's coming out even just from machinery side of things is extremely, extremely difficult.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:15:50):**  There's a lot of product and machinery is so technical and so precise these days. It's  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:15:56):**  really difficult for these guys to know everything. And I suppose in a way the integrated solutions  
**[0:16:02-0:16:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:16:02):**  department was put there to remedy that in a way. So it was a reference point for sales  
**[0:16:08-0:16:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:16:08):**  people and their clients to get the information that they needed. So as we went along in that  
**[0:16:15-0:16:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:16:15):**  journey, we actually started to reduce the number of issues and the number of calls and  
**[0:16:23-0:16:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:16:23):**  time it took up for the service or tech department to try and fix. So it's an interesting scenario.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:16:33):**  There's no real blame. The growers really got to take responsibility for what they're  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:16:37):**  looking at.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:16:38):**  It's such an interesting incentive question. It's a classic buyer beware, seller beware  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:16:46):**  dynamic, but it's also where does the responsibility shifts. I know in the software world, it was  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:16:53):**  an interesting change where it used to be that the seller had all the information around  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:16:58):**  a car or a piece of software or whatever. And then with the internet, you can just research  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:17:02):**  everything. And so the buyer has more information. But it's interesting because when it gets  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:17:08):**  super complicated, you kind of need information to exist on both sides and then who has the  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:17:13):**  incentive to get and give really good information.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:17:16):**  Yeah. And the other issue is really the language that's used in tech and it's extremely foreign  
**[0:17:25-0:17:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:17:25):**  for your normal everyday grower. And for them to just understand what the terms mean, it's  
**[0:17:35-0:17:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:17:35):**  difficult and it takes some time to learn those things. And if you're not tech savvy  
**[0:17:42-0:17:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:17:42):**  and you're not really, I suppose in that generation that is extremely tech savvy, you really struggle  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:17:50):**  just with the language.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:17:51):**  Yeah. I mean, I sort of think about when I go to my mechanic to get my car fixed and  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:17:57):**  I'm like, I don't know what you're saying and I don't know how these parts fit together.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:18:00):**  I feel like I'm a smart person and I can get how systems work. But I don't know what you're  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:18:06):**  saying and I'm frustrated that I want to trust you, but I don't trust you and I don't speak  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:18:10):**  your language. It's the same kind of thing I imagine.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:18:12):**  Yeah, it is. It's very similar. And it will change. That sort of situation will change  
**[0:18:21-0:18:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:18:21):**  over time as we move through generations. And obviously the next generation of farm  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:18:29):**  or a grower will be much more tech savvy. But the issue that we're having at the moment  
**[0:18:35-0:18:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:18:35):**  is we're falling behind and we're missing so much in a situation where there's some  
**[0:18:44-0:18:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:18:44):**  solutions there that can really help.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:18:47):**  When you say we're missing stuff, you mean like there's good stuff out there, but we're  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:18:51):**  not getting into the hands of growers?  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:18:53):**  No, not so much from that point of view. We're just missing data. The growers are missing  
**[0:18:58-0:19:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:18:58):**  data. So really, if you look at the so-called data value proposition, don't get me started  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:19:08):**  on that.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:19:09):**  Yeah, you're going into buzzword land.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:19:14):**  Yes. There's two types of value here. You've got your short term and obviously your long  
**[0:19:22-0:19:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:19:22):**  term. So data history, it's undervalued. It's really, really, really important. And as we  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:19:30):**  move forward, as we keep moving along, the more of that we miss, that we don't record  
**[0:19:36-0:19:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:19:36):**  and we don't keep, the harder it is to catch up. And really precision ag is more about  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:19:48):**  getting into a situation where you can actually start being proactive and start modelling  
**[0:19:53-0:20:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:19:53):**  maybe, looking at conditions and what's going to happen and being able to remedy those issues  
**[0:20:00-0:20:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:20:00):**  before they come, before you find them, because you know the history of that field or with  
**[0:20:08-0:20:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:20:08):**  that crop and in these type of conditions. And while we're not capturing that, you get  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:20:15):**  put back and put back and put back and put back. And it worries me because I know in  
**[0:20:22-0:20:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:20:22):**  other parts of the world, the data capture is extremely, extremely important. And I think  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:20:31):**  as we move forward and what's going to happen in the next 20 years, as far as the population  
**[0:20:35-0:20:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:20:35):**  is concerned, and food and pressure on everybody to do more with less, the key really is in  
**[0:20:42-0:20:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:20:42):**  PA and data. And we've done as much as we possibly can at this stage with plant research.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:20:51):**  So we're looking for other places to find those gains.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:20:57):**  You said there were two aspects, so that's the long-term one. And I think it's fascinating  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:21:01):**  because you get into questions of, is the government going to mandate that that data  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:21:04):**  get collected for the benefit of food security and some really interesting broader issues  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:21:10):**  that get brought into play, but what's the short-term side of that?  
**[0:21:14-0:21:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:21:14):**  The short-term is purely just being able to make some decisions in a timely manner and  
**[0:21:21-0:21:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:21:21):**  being able to collaboratively make decisions with your agronomy partners. I think that's  
**[0:21:29-0:21:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:21:29):**  really important, being able to exchange information or data quickly, knowing that the data that's  
**[0:21:40-0:21:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:21:40):**  been generated has got some integrity, obviously. But yeah, it's being able to make those everyday  
**[0:21:50-0:21:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:21:50):**  on-farm practical decisions that make it easier and give people more confidence to know that,  
**[0:21:59-0:22:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:21:59):**  yeah, I can see this is the pattern, this is what I need to do. And also from an agronomy  
**[0:22:06-0:22:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:22:06):**  point of view, gee, good quality data sets that are timely really helps those guys help  
**[0:22:16-0:22:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:22:16):**  the growers back. But it needs to have some integrity, it needs to be collected and it  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:22:24):**  needs to be shared. Whereas technology now, we can do all that. Those things are easy,  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:22:30):**  but you'll find a large percentage of growers just don't know where to start.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:22:36):**  So this gets into some of the work that you've been doing around how to get started and some  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:22:41):**  of the case studies, which is how we met. But I want to connect the dots. So I totally  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:22:45):**  interrupted you on your story about starting to build some software, which is not easy  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:22:50):**  to do. Did you figure out how to write software? Did you hire a company to write software?  
**[0:22:54-0:22:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:22:54):**  How did you even do that?  
**[0:22:57-0:23:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:22:57):**  We hired somebody, a developer and nothing against developers, but gee, what a nightmare.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:23:12):**  The issue that I've had all along with that part of development, especially just purely  
**[0:23:18-0:23:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:23:18):**  software development is, I mean, it's a lot open with web-based applications and so forth.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:23:25):**  It's more open than what it ever has been. But where we're going to go to in the next  
**[0:23:30-0:23:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:23:30):**  10, 15 years is really when we're looking at machine or automation and IoT. It's very,  
**[0:23:41-0:23:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:23:41):**  very hard to plan when you're building software in that regard to plan for say things like  
**[0:23:47-0:24:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:23:47):**  IoT. And that sensor data is really going to be a big part of the process.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:24:00):**  I think I know what you mean, but for myself and if we put this out there for listeners,  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:24:07):**  explain what you mean by that.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:24:08):**  So Internet of Things. The way we collect data right now is really brand-orientated.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:24:19):**  Everything's fitted in the machine. You purchase your modem or whatever, it's all brand-orientated.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:24:28):**  And the sensor data that we collect actually comes through the machine. So when we look  
**[0:24:35-0:24:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:24:35):**  at other things that aren't machine-based, like take soil moisture data for an example,  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:24:46):**  we really want to be able to integrate that data straight into whatever we're doing, whatever  
**[0:24:50-0:24:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:24:50):**  software we're using. And it'll take some Internet of Things hardware and some machine  
**[0:24:57-0:25:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:24:57):**  learning software to actually get the full benefit of that. So it's really important  
**[0:25:05-0:25:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:25:05):**  that when we look down the track, we're really thinking, forward thinking and thinking, okay,  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:25:12):**  what's the next thing that's going to come up? And when we start talking about the Internet  
**[0:25:18-0:25:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:25:18):**  and signal and so forth, and we know that's an issue everywhere, there are some simple  
**[0:25:27-0:25:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:25:27):**  solutions for that now, but they involve that type of hardware and software. So it really  
**[0:25:36-0:25:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:25:36):**  needs to be considered. So if you build a closed website that can generate a map and  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:25:44):**  whatever you need it to do, you find it very difficult on the back end to try and integrate  
**[0:25:50-0:25:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:25:50):**  some of that new tech and some of that new sense of data. So we want to keep it open  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:25:58):**  as we possibly can. So going back to your first question, yeah, we definitely went down  
**[0:26:05-0:26:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:26:05):**  the track of a developer, but we actually changed track and we're actually using some  
**[0:26:14-0:26:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:26:14):**  web services now. So the software that we have will ingest any data type. So it doesn't  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:26:22):**  matter what type of file it is, it's colourblind. So it doesn't matter if it's coming from red  
**[0:26:28-0:26:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:26:28):**  or green or whatever. And we can then, instead of a grower having to buy a full software  
**[0:26:37-0:26:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:26:37):**  package that you pay thousands of dollars a year for that you use probably 5% of, you  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:26:44):**  can actually pull in modules, a little blockchain-ish, where you can pull in a module that will generate  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:26:49):**  a map for you for that instance, or you can pull in a module that will generate a report  
**[0:26:54-0:27:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:26:54):**  for you. So I suppose it's really more tailor made to suit the growers needs rather than  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:27:04):**  here's a big bunch of data in this software package. You're probably not going to use  
**[0:27:09-0:27:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:27:09):**  the backend financial part of things, you use something else for that. So that's been  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:27:18):**  a real issue. That's why it's been really difficult for growers to find a software package  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:27:22):**  that really suits them because most of them just want to be able to open up a yield map  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:27:28):**  and read it and create some zones and maybe do a prescription type scenario and send it  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:27:33):**  back to the machine.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:27:37):**  One thing that's, I guess the other side of that is if as a developer, as a company building  
**[0:27:43-0:27:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:27:43):**  these tools, if you don't sell all of the tool but you had to build all of the tool,  
**[0:27:49-0:27:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:27:49):**  then how do you make money?  
**[0:27:51-0:27:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:27:51):**  That's right.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:27:52):**  So what's the kind of business model side of this? Because there's definitely a trade  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:27:55):**  off there.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:27:57):**  There always is. And I think the business model is probably more rather than less. So  
**[0:28:11-0:28:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:28:11):**  because we can develop this in a much cheaper way, it's obviously much more affordable for  
**[0:28:18-0:28:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:28:18):**  the end user. And because the end user can then pick and choose which modules he wants  
**[0:28:25-0:28:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:28:25):**  to put together to suit himself, he then gets a better benefit.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:28:33):**  Can you, let's go through an example because I think it's easy to talk about at the high  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:28:37):**  level but walk me through, I pick how to use a module and then what do I do? Is there an  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:28:43):**  agronomist involved? Just a simple kind of use case.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:28:49):**  All those options are available. So data sharing, and I use that term really extremely broadly,  
**[0:28:58-0:29:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:28:58):**  but for a grower, he's mainly sharing his data with his agronomist. So having a normal  
**[0:29:05-0:29:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:29:05):**  username, password access scenario with access levels to that specific site for that specific  
**[0:29:18-0:29:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:29:18):**  grower is really important. And then obviously, if I'm just like most growers where my data  
**[0:29:30-0:29:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:29:30):**  really does, I don't really see it, my agronomist comes and collects it for me, but he takes  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:29:37):**  it away, I'll never see it, those sorts of scenarios. So if we can start with say just  
**[0:29:43-0:29:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:29:43):**  a pure storage module, so growers can actually just use it just for storage and they're willing  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:29:53):**  to give you that option. But then if I want to say, okay, I want to be able to share,  
**[0:29:58-0:30:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:29:58):**  we can bring that case model in and then we can add users to that site. Then if we want  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:30:06):**  to, and I think that's the most important thing. There's been a lot of focus on being  
**[0:30:11-0:30:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:30:11):**  able to ingest this data, have a look at the map, generate zones and so forth, but that's  
**[0:30:19-0:30:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:30:19):**  not happening very much. The grower's agronomists are doing those sorts of things for them and  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:30:26):**  being able to share between each other really quickly and easily is really important. And  
**[0:30:31-0:30:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:30:31):**  also being able to keep a original raw file of your data is really important because say  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:30:39):**  a comparison now, if you use other software, say you've got a file off your machine and  
**[0:30:43-0:30:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:30:43):**  you put it in module or you go to SST or you go to Trimble, as soon as the data has gone  
**[0:30:49-0:30:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:30:49):**  into that software and it's been aggregated, it's changed forever. And effectively, you  
**[0:30:56-0:31:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:30:56):**  don't keep that raw data somewhere, it's lost. So it tends to start to answer a couple of  
**[0:31:05-0:31:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:31:05):**  those little questions about data ownership and data sharing as well. So I digress here,  
**[0:31:16-0:31:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:31:16):**  sorry.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:31:17):**  No, no, no, no, it's good. It's interesting. I guess I'm trying to get my head around how  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:31:21):**  much of this is theoretical and how much of it is like, this is software we've built or  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:31:26):**  this is software that you guys advise that others can use. So how much of this, because  
**[0:31:31-0:31:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:31:31):**  I'm trying to connect it back to your story, which I'm now in.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:31:34):**  That's fine. So we're at a stage we've built the base software. So we can, it'll ingest  
**[0:31:43-0:31:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:31:43):**  data from anywhere and any type. You can store it safely and you can also share it with whoever  
**[0:31:51-0:31:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:31:51):**  you want to share it with at the moment. In a few weeks, we'll have the map generation  
**[0:31:59-0:32:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:31:59):**  module available. So you can either choose to have that map generation module with you  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:32:05):**  all the time. So that's just another set of software, just another bunch of software that  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:32:11):**  will take that file, no matter what it is, and ingest it and create a map out of it.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:32:16):**  So say a yield map, then you could, or you can also choose to have that data aggregated  
**[0:32:24-0:32:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:32:24):**  offsite so you can send it back to the server and have it aggregated in the server and sent  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:32:34):**  back to you. So there's a couple of different choices there. That's available now.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:32:40):**  And when you say we and available, which company is bringing you this?  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:32:44):**  I can't say.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:32:45):**  Okay. This is a secret company that you're working with.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:32:50):**  Yes. They're not very secret. They're quite large.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:32:55):**  But they'll remain endless.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:32:58):**  Well, exactly. They have to at the moment. So I don't want to get anybody into trouble.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:33:03):**  Fair enough.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:33:06):**  And that was a bit of a fluke relationship us coming across that as well, which I'll  
**[0:33:13-0:33:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:33:13):**  tell you about off there at some stage.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:33:16):**  So you've been involved in this space a while. I'm curious, actually, some of the timeframes  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:33:22):**  here, because when you were talking about your work back in John Deere land with integrated  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:33:27):**  solutions, when was that? What was the timeframe there?  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:33:32):**  So that was 2008 to 2013.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:33:37):**  Okay. And I imagine the, well, I'm curious, has the conversation evolved since then? Are  
**[0:33:46-0:33:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:33:46):**  you still getting the same kind of phone calls or is it-  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:33:48):**  Same phone calls. Same phone calls, mate. Yeah.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:33:51):**  And what needs to change? How do we fix this problem?  
**[0:33:55-0:34:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:33:55):**  So if you look at... So part of this case study with IRAC was we really needed to have  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:34:03):**  a deeper look at this and not so much the tech side of things, but the motivation and  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:34:08):**  the attitudes that growers had.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:34:11):**  And just before you get into that, tell us who IRAC is.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:34:14):**  So Irrigation Research and Extension Committee in our region, who are a grower membership  
**[0:34:22-0:34:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:34:22):**  committee headed by Rob Houghton and Eva Carissa. You guys went and had a look at the trial  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:34:30):**  site. So they've been responsible for a lot of plant research and crop research over the  
**[0:34:35-0:34:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:34:35):**  last number of years. Worked very closely with CRDC and Comp Australia and a few other  
**[0:34:49-0:34:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:34:49):**  government-born agencies.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:34:51):**  So you guys were setting out to solve the kind of, where do we get started problem or  
**[0:34:56-0:34:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:34:56):**  how do we fix it?  
**[0:34:57-0:35:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:34:57):**  Yeah, exactly. And it was more the let's have a look at why there hasn't been an adoption.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:35:06):**  We know there's an adoption problem and let's really have a look at why. And so we were  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:35:15):**  a little bit lucky mid last year. I ran some cotton picker or some data management training  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:35:20):**  for cotton and a heap of growers from IRAC came along. It was for IRAC. And after that,  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:35:26):**  the conversation started and everybody said, so we should do this and we should do that.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:35:31):**  And then I had a good chat to Rob and Eva and we all knew that there was this elephant  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:35:40):**  in the room. And even when I was running the cotton picker data management training, you  
**[0:35:45-0:35:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:35:45):**  can really see some blank faces. And it's as basic as basic the training. And I'm thinking,  
**[0:35:53-0:36:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:35:53):**  oh, there's something else that's underlying here. There's no motivation. And so when we  
**[0:36:01-0:36:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:36:01):**  started to, we created the My Data Management Case Study Project and we put together eight  
**[0:36:08-0:36:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:36:08):**  growers from across the region with different levels of adoption and also a few different  
**[0:36:17-0:36:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:36:17):**  types of crops and also growers that had some history in the region. But also growers that  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:36:26):**  we knew didn't have a data value proposition issue. The growers that might have thought  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:36:32):**  they were mad at the time that were still keen and eager to push on with their precision  
**[0:36:36-0:36:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:36:36):**  ag quest, even though they'd been browbeaten over the last 10 or 15 years, but still had  
**[0:36:48-0:36:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:36:48):**  the drive to move forward with it. That was a little difficult. But we put together these  
**[0:36:57-0:37:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:36:57):**  growers who are fantastic guys and we put together a set of baseline questions for them  
**[0:37:07-0:37:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:37:07):**  and their agronomy partners. And we filmed all the actual interviews just to get an idea  
**[0:37:16-0:37:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:37:16):**  of exactly where people were at. And it was all confronting.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:37:23):**  Sorry, I didn't interrupt you again. What kinds of things did you ask them? Give me  
**[0:37:26-0:37:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:37:26):**  a couple of example questions.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:37:30):**  A lot of it was based around their attitudes towards data and data collection. Simple questions  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:37:39):**  like where do you see data in your business and data management in your business in the  
**[0:37:44-0:37:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:37:44):**  future? Do you see a future for it? And lots of other things like what are you using now?  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:37:52):**  Are you sharing and are you collecting and sharing data now? Who's your agronomist? Are  
**[0:37:58-0:38:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:37:58):**  they collecting and sharing data for you? Just all those really baseline questions.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:38:07):**  And a lot of them were, I suppose, angled to get a reaction from the experience that  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:38:13):**  they'd already had in the past. Not so much what their expectation was, but what their  
**[0:38:19-0:38:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:38:19):**  experience was in the past. Because we already knew that their expectation was high for PA  
**[0:38:27-0:38:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:38:27):**  and data management in the future. But we wanted to know why they hadn't moved towards  
**[0:38:33-0:38:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:38:33):**  it now.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:38:34):**  And what did you find? What were some of the reasons?  
**[0:38:40-0:38:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:38:40):**  The major reason, the major driver was just purely poor previous experience. So all the  
**[0:38:49-0:38:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:38:49):**  guys, we made sure that they'd all spent money, spent large sums of money upgrading their  
**[0:38:57-0:39:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:38:57):**  machinery and upgrading their data generation and collection, hardware and software, the  
**[0:39:03-0:39:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:39:03):**  machine automation, hardware and software, only to have a bad experience on the back  
**[0:39:11-0:39:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:39:11):**  end of that. And there were varying degrees or reasons why some were their own fault,  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:39:19):**  some were reseller or dealership born. But a lot of it was because no one could get any  
**[0:39:25-0:39:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:39:25):**  support and there was no, there was so much, such a large knowledge gap in all areas, not  
**[0:39:35-0:39:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:39:35):**  just from one party. And then obviously frustration sets in. But also, I think everybody went  
**[0:39:44-0:39:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:39:44):**  off a little half-cocked and we started in the middle of the race. We didn't start at  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:39:48):**  the start. So there was no really preparation for the business in the first place to become  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:39:54):**  more digital. Right. And tell me about that. Like, what would that look like in the ideal  
**[0:39:58-0:40:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:39:58):**  case and what does it look like in reality? So in reality, people are still using, some  
**[0:40:07-0:40:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:40:07):**  of our girls are still using Windows 7 as operating software for their computers. A  
**[0:40:16-0:40:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:40:16):**  lot of guys can't link an email account to their phone. Although the internet scenario  
**[0:40:23-0:40:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:40:23):**  has gotten better, we must admit over the last five or six years. The actual knowledge  
**[0:40:30-0:40:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:40:30):**  about just basic computer skills 101 is really, there's a really big gap there. Setting up  
**[0:40:38-0:40:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:40:38):**  updates, all those normal things that probably you and I do more often because we're on our  
**[0:40:46-0:40:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:40:46):**  computers so much. It was quite startling. And do you think it's just a kind of technical  
**[0:40:57-0:41:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:40:57):**  thing? Or is there like an emotional, like is it going back to my kind of mechanic example?  
**[0:41:01-0:41:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:41:01):**  Like I get almost ashamed that I don't know this stuff and so I don't want to deal with  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:41:07):**  it. I'm just like, I can't, it's too painful. Is there any of that kind of like, it's so  
**[0:41:11-0:41:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:41:11):**  miserable and I wish I knew and I don't know. And so I just don't want to deal with it.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:41:15):**  Definitely. Look, that's definitely part of it. The other part of it is a time scenario.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:41:21):**  So every grower that you have sitting behind a desk looking at a computer is tapping his  
**[0:41:26-0:41:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:41:26):**  foot going, I should be outside doing something else. So there's more of the acceptance that  
**[0:41:33-0:41:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:41:33):**  this is now part of your business. And you need to take notice of this part of your business  
**[0:41:42-0:41:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:41:42):**  because if you don't fix this, this start here. So if you keep coming in here and your  
**[0:41:48-0:41:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:41:48):**  laptop takes 30 minutes to load and every time you go into the internet, it drops out.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:41:54):**  You know, every time you get a, send an email, you can't get it to send.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:41:59):**  Yeah, no, I, yeah, it's, it's miserable. You want to just get on with better things to  
**[0:42:04-0:42:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:42:04):**  do and you know, it's like the third time something goes wrong, you're like, all right,  
**[0:42:08-0:42:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:42:08):**  I'm done.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:42:09):**  I'm out of here. Yeah. And you know, you and I both know that it's very easy. There are,  
**[0:42:14-0:42:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:42:14):**  there's some really simple solutions to those issues and it may involve the,  
**[0:42:18-0:42:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:42:18):**  what do you do then? Do you kind of, how do you go about creating those solutions and  
**[0:42:21-0:42:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:42:21):**  getting them in the hands of the people that need them?  
**[0:42:24-0:42:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:42:24):**  Yeah. So the delivery is interesting because there are so many different scenarios, but  
**[0:42:29-0:42:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:42:29):**  I think the main thing we need to bear in mind is the, the, the number one, the first,  
**[0:42:35-0:42:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:42:35):**  the start of what we do is we really need to get the best out of what we've already  
**[0:42:41-0:42:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:42:41):**  got. So we don't want, we don't want to go, be going to grow a sign. You've got to spend  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:42:46):**  here, you've got to spend there. You know, you've got to do this, you've got to do that.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:42:50):**  So let's, let's take stock. So what we did as part as, as the first part of the case  
**[0:42:57-0:43:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:42:57):**  study was we also did a machine hardware and software audit. So we recorded every piece  
**[0:43:05-0:43:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:43:05):**  of machinery hardware and software that growers have. We recorded their, their serial numbers,  
**[0:43:12-0:43:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:43:12):**  their, their software versions. So we could get a better picture of exactly what each  
**[0:43:20-0:43:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:43:20):**  grower had to offer at their, at their disposal at this moment right now. And, and let's work  
**[0:43:30-0:43:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:43:30):**  with that to start with before we go looking too far into the future. You know, the guys,  
**[0:43:36-0:43:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:43:36):**  once I said before, the guys, a lot of people have spent money and bought hardware and software,  
**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:43:42):**  but aren't getting them, aren't getting the full benefit out of it. Right. And so let's  
**[0:43:46-0:43:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:43:46):**  work with that first. And it honestly, so it will be a step by step by step by step  
**[0:43:53-0:44:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:43:53):**  process that will event in a, in a, in a much, much easier, much more user-friendly way to,  
**[0:44:02-0:44:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:44:02):**  to, to start to generate, store, share and use, use, use good data. So, you know, if  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:44:11):**  you start to talk to one of the growers about data standardization, they look at you and  
**[0:44:16-0:44:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:44:16):**  go, what are you talking about? Right. And so you've really got to use, once again, you've  
**[0:44:22-0:44:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:44:22):**  got to use language that, you know, that people understand. Which, which, you know, it sounds  
**[0:44:30-0:44:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:44:30):**  a little bit harsh in a way, but we really need to go back to that, to that. No, I mean,  
**[0:44:36-0:44:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:44:36):**  I think it's the same. Like if, you know, I get this experience all the time, actually,  
**[0:44:40-0:44:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:44:40):**  when I talk to growers where we got to find that kind of common ground, cause I could  
**[0:44:44-0:44:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:44:44):**  go off and talk about technology or venture capital or all that, and it would be totally,  
**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:44:48):**  you know, foreign. And in the same way, they could talk about the nuances of, of cotton  
**[0:44:52-0:44:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:44:52):**  agronomy and I would be totally lost. So where do we find that kind of common ground where  
**[0:44:58-0:45:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:44:58):**  we can actually speak the same language and how do you create good tools that, that help,  
**[0:45:03-0:45:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:45:03):**  even if you don't have a human there? Cause I think we need humans there in lots of cases,  
**[0:45:07-0:45:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:45:07):**  but there's a bunch of stuff that I think we need to be able to fix ourselves and kind  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:45:13):**  of get started before we get to the complex stuff where we might need humans or help.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:45:18):**  Because otherwise it's just expensive. Yeah, definitely, definitely correct there.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:45:23):**  Look at, and while we need, while we need, that, that won't change, Sarah. It'll be the  
**[0:45:33-0:45:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:45:33):**  same way for a long time. That human intervention has to be there. One of the other biggest,  
**[0:45:40-0:45:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:45:40):**  I suppose the biggest, biggest issue is the issue of support. And you know, the problem  
**[0:45:48-0:45:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:45:48):**  is when you, when you sell hardware, software you need to, you need to provide support and,  
**[0:45:58-0:46:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:45:58):**  and it's a cost. And, and I think a lot of the, a lot of the software development companies,  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:46:06):**  especially in Ag are really struggling to get their head around, you know, I need to,  
**[0:46:11-0:46:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:46:11):**  I need to provide a really, really strong support service here. Otherwise, yeah, it's  
**[0:46:17-0:46:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:46:17):**  really interesting. Like a lot of the startups, especially that don't have an Ag background,  
**[0:46:22-0:46:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:46:22):**  you know, get to the point of, okay, I realized that I'm not going to sell all this on the  
**[0:46:25-0:46:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:46:25):**  internet, so I should probably go through a channel and probably, you know, connect  
**[0:46:29-0:46:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:46:29):**  with someone who has boots on the ground near my customers. And then the next kind of iteration  
**[0:46:34-0:46:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:46:34):**  we've seen is, well, those guys that have boots on the ground, even if they have some  
**[0:46:39-0:46:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:46:39):**  kind of incentive to sell my product, they don't probably have an incentive to service  
**[0:46:43-0:46:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:46:43):**  it, which goes back to your point of, of incentives before where, you know, it's like who's going  
**[0:46:48-0:46:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:46:48):**  to be there when it breaks and how do you make sure that there's support throughout  
**[0:46:51-0:46:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:46:51):**  the life cycle? Not just when you sell it. And I think no one's really figured out how  
**[0:46:57-0:47:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:46:57):**  to crack that nut in the kind of digital tech data space and take money out of it.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:47:03):**  You're a hundred percent right. And it's interesting too, it's, it's sort of, I suppose it's exaggerated  
**[0:47:09-0:47:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:47:09):**  by the fact that the farmers work 24 seven. So if I have an issue, a tech issue at 11  
**[0:47:16-0:47:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:47:16):**  o'clock at night in my machine, I want to get it fixed. And who's going to answer my  
**[0:47:24-0:47:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:47:24):**  call 11 o'clock at night? And so it really, it makes it even harder because it's not a  
**[0:47:29-0:47:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:47:29):**  fire scenario. And obviously there's a, there's a massive, I think there's a large skills  
**[0:47:37-0:47:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:47:37):**  shortage there and knowledge gap. So I think it's these sorts of resellers and developers  
**[0:47:43-0:47:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:47:43):**  and on sellers are really struggling to find people that fit that space.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:47:50):**  I was just at a conference this weekend. One of the big topics that came up was around  
**[0:47:55-0:48:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:47:55):**  education and kind of how do we get the next generation of people who can help solve this  
**[0:48:00-0:48:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:48:00):**  problem because yes, it's technology, but it's also people in regional areas that have  
**[0:48:04-0:48:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:48:04):**  these skills and want to work in these jobs. And that's not a, it's not like we have this  
**[0:48:10-0:48:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:48:10):**  ready set of talent and we're not using them. It's like that doesn't exist.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:48:13):**  Yeah, look, it's interesting, you know, cause I've got a daughter in year 12 at school now  
**[0:48:19-0:48:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:48:19):**  and she's a daughter that's two years into university, but even the ag subject at school  
**[0:48:29-0:48:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:48:29):**  is extremely outdated. There's no, there's a lot of focus on animal and plant health,  
**[0:48:38-0:48:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:48:38):**  but there's no focus at all on tech or on data and management. And maybe that needs  
**[0:48:48-0:49:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:48:48):**  to change as well. I don't know, but it, yeah, there's definitely a gap there at the moment.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:49:01):**  Do you see this, you know, you're talking before about the new kinds of data collection,  
**[0:49:06-0:49:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:49:06):**  so whether it's IOT or satellites or you know, kind of fully changing how that information  
**[0:49:13-0:49:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:49:13):**  collection analysis, decision making, supply chain works. Do you think that will help?  
**[0:49:18-0:49:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:49:18):**  Cause I'm, I'm, people talk about a world where you can remove some of the pain points  
**[0:49:23-0:49:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:49:23):**  here through technology and you know, it can get set up faster. It can collect faster,  
**[0:49:28-0:49:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:49:28):**  analyze faster and get to a automated implementation of a decision, right? You can just kind of  
**[0:49:33-0:49:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:49:33):**  close the loop. Do you think that is, is going to happen? Is it coming soon? Are the same  
**[0:49:37-0:49:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:49:37):**  adoption challenges going to exist in that world?  
**[0:49:40-0:49:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:49:40):**  I don't think the same adoption challenges will exist in that world. I think, I think  
**[0:49:45-0:49:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:49:45):**  that is definitely coming. The timeframe wise, you know, probably depending on what sort  
**[0:49:53-0:49:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:49:53):**  of execution or what sort of penetration you have with it, but probably, you know, maybe  
**[0:49:59-0:50:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:49:59):**  four to eight years. I think, I think things will change rapidly. Again, we sort of had  
**[0:50:07-0:50:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:50:07):**  a little bit of a lull. There's been a lot of focus on backend software and map generation  
**[0:50:13-0:50:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:50:13):**  software and farm management software. I think once growers realise that the brand, big brand  
**[0:50:32-0:50:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:50:32):**  development really hinges on market share and that the development of software through  
**[0:50:43-0:50:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:50:43):**  those brand companies is for the purpose of controlling market share, not for the betterment  
**[0:50:49-0:50:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:50:49):**  of the grower. So I think once there's that realisation takes a hold, things like IOT  
**[0:50:59-0:51:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:50:59):**  and other ways of collecting data and different sensors will, and obviously just normal general  
**[0:51:08-0:51:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:51:08):**  technology advancements will change rapidly. But I think, I think, you know, I think there's  
**[0:51:14-0:51:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:51:14):**  a lot there now that, that we could use that other sectors just haven't been game to sort  
**[0:51:21-0:51:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:51:21):**  of move into that agricultural part because of the fear.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:51:27):**  That's an example of that.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:51:29):**  So if you look at certainly some machine learning stuff and machine automation application controllers  
**[0:51:41-0:51:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:51:41):**  that have come from different non-brand developers that are probably more efficient, especially  
**[0:51:55-0:52:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:51:55):**  when you're talking about yield monitoring, so yield sensing. So the yield sensing capabilities  
**[0:52:05-0:52:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:52:05):**  or monitoring capabilities of say your modern day cotton picker is still really hit and  
**[0:52:11-0:52:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:52:11):**  miss. But there's technology there now that, because we're still using microwave sensors,  
**[0:52:20-0:52:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:52:20):**  so mass flow sensors, have been around for quite some time now. But I don't think, you  
**[0:52:30-0:52:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:52:30):**  know, there's hardware and software there now that can sense yield much more mass flow,  
**[0:52:38-0:52:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:52:38):**  much more sensitively, much more, I suppose, taking into consideration all the other variables  
**[0:52:47-0:52:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:52:47):**  like moisture and stopping and starting and trash and leaf and so forth. But sort of there  
**[0:52:59-0:53:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:52:59):**  hasn't been a movement towards ag with that tech. And I think as far as the adoption of  
**[0:53:07-0:53:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:53:07):**  satellite technology, we've really, really, we've really taken that and run with it. And  
**[0:53:12-0:53:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:53:12):**  obviously it's getting better and better all the time. But I think I was hearing somewhere  
**[0:53:19-0:53:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:53:19):**  on the news recently with some new tech coming out in that space as well. So there's technology  
**[0:53:28-0:53:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:53:28):**  in the marketplace now that just I don't think we've, there's certainly untapped from the  
**[0:53:36-0:53:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:53:36):**  ag sector, that's for sure. Because we've really relied on these big brands to develop  
**[0:53:43-0:53:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:53:43):**  tech through their machinery. And they've done a good job with that. Don't get me wrong.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:53:51):**  But I'd like to see two more players, that's for sure.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:53:58):**  One of my kind of last questions, I guess, are areas to explore is that, and you mentioned  
**[0:54:03-0:54:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:54:03):**  it before, the need for a human in the loop and the really close relationship with an  
**[0:54:07-0:54:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:54:07):**  agronomist and even the role of agronomy. How do you see the kind of grower to agronomist  
**[0:54:12-0:54:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:54:12):**  relationship changing in the future?  
**[0:54:15-0:54:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:54:15):**  Yeah, well, I think it will. Data definitely provides or brings with it responsibility.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:54:27):**  And I think what it will do, I think the positive thing it will do is it will create a much  
**[0:54:32-0:54:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:54:32):**  more collaborative relationship between grower and agronomy. And I think it will also, I  
**[0:54:47-0:54:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:54:47):**  suppose, without trying to be too hard, it'll create some responsibility. So the decisions  
**[0:54:58-0:55:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:54:58):**  that we're making, we'll be able to be tracked and we'll be able to tell whether they're  
**[0:55:01-0:55:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:55:01):**  right or wrong. So that may change a little bit as far as that relationship is with agronomy.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:55:11):**  But I think, look, out here, all the growers have really, really strong relationships with  
**[0:55:17-0:55:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:55:17):**  agronomists. And I must say that we're very lucky we've got some very, very smart guys  
**[0:55:24-0:55:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:55:24):**  in agronomy here. But in saying that, what's, real quickly, what's been happening is, because  
**[0:55:31-0:55:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:55:31):**  of the growers have been so reluctant to really get in and start pushing his PA quest, and  
**[0:55:40-0:55:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:55:40):**  he's had so many issues with machinery and data collection and so forth. What's been  
**[0:55:46-0:55:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:55:46):**  happening is the agronomy sector. So agronomists have now been, have started to take that over  
**[0:55:52-0:55:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:55:52):**  so that they know how important that data is. And so they've been actually going, setting  
**[0:55:59-0:56:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:55:59):**  up machines, setting up software, collecting data for the grower, which is not really sustainable  
**[0:56:08-0:56:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:56:08):**  for agronomy. They spend a lot of time, a lot of their own time, doing, managing those  
**[0:56:14-0:56:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:56:14):**  sorts of things, where really when we spoke to all the agronomists, they all just said,  
**[0:56:20-0:56:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:56:20):**  we just want the data, just give me the data. I don't care what it is, just give me something  
**[0:56:24-0:56:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:56:24):**  that I can just log onto and pull something off and go, okay, I can do something with  
**[0:56:31-0:56:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:56:31):**  that. So it's a little bit of frustration there from the poor old agronomy part.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:56:36):**  I think there's no shortage of frustration in this space, so it's quite a bit of that.  
**[0:56:42-0:56:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:56:42):**  There definitely is. And quite rightfully so, from what I've seen over the last long  
**[0:56:47-0:56:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:56:47):**  period of time. It's a little criminal what's happened to our growers. And I know we're  
**[0:56:56-0:57:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:56:56):**  at the beginning of this precision ag journey, which could go anywhere over the next 10 or  
**[0:57:04-0:57:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:57:04):**  20 years, but in the rush and the pushing and shovelling and jostling for position,  
**[0:57:13-0:57:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:57:13):**  the growers have been pretty much left out in the cold. And look, don't get me wrong,  
**[0:57:22-0:57:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:57:22):**  there's plenty of precision ag courses you can go to and sit. And I've been and also  
**[0:57:33-0:57:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:57:33):**  presented at and facilitated many courses over the years and looked at a lot of blank  
**[0:57:40-0:57:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:57:40):**  faces because a grower doesn't really know.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:57:45):**  Do you think that's because it's not done in an engaging way? It's not hitting the mark?  
**[0:57:49-0:57:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:57:49):**  It seems like that, if done well, would help, is a solution?  
**[0:57:54-0:58:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:57:54):**  Look, really, the last one I went to was fantastic, absolutely fantastic for me. And it jolted  
**[0:58:03-0:58:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:58:03):**  my memory on quite a few things. But before a grower can really understand what data density  
**[0:58:09-0:58:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:58:09):**  is or data standardisation, he really needs to know how to get himself ready on his farm.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:58:21):**  So he needs to know, guys talking about importing this layer and importing that layer and most  
**[0:58:27-0:58:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:58:27):**  growers are going, I can't even generate one. So it tends to miss that mark, but nobody  
**[0:58:34-0:58:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:58:34):**  wants to go back and say, okay, this is what we're going to do. We're going to all hold  
**[0:58:41-0:58:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:58:41):**  hands here and sing kumbaya and we're going to go right back to the start. We're going  
**[0:58:46-0:58:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:58:46):**  to walk through these steps and we're going to make sure that everything from when you  
**[0:58:51-0:58:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:58:51):**  walk into your office in the morning, that everything is as easy as it possibly can be.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:58:58):**  What's one piece of advice you'd have for a grower in this space to kind of get started,  
**[0:59:04-0:59:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:59:04):**  like a practical thing they could do? And I guess same thing on the kind of startup  
**[0:59:07-0:59:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:59:07):**  or technology side, what's one piece of advice you'd have for that audience?  
**[0:59:12-0:59:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:59:12):**  Know what you've got and know what your capabilities are right now before you decide to go any  
**[0:59:20-0:59:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:59:20):**  further. So by that, I mean, know what you've got in your office space, know what the machinery  
**[0:59:29-0:59:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:59:29):**  that you have is capable of, know what it will integrate with and what it won't integrate  
**[0:59:35-0:59:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:59:35):**  with, know what software you have, learn how to manage, put a data standardization strategy  
**[0:59:47-0:59:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:59:47):**  in place and then work from there and build slowly on what you're doing. Don't expect  
**[0:59:57-1:00:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=0:59:57):**  that you're going to be able to move from where you are to a precision ag operation  
**[1:00:02-1:00:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:00:02):**  from one day to the next. It's quite a long journey.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:00:07):**  Yep. And for the startup side or kind of tech developer side, what advice would you have  
**[1:00:13-1:00:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:00:13):**  for them? Keep your mind open and don't be influenced  
**[1:00:21-1:00:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:00:21):**  by developers and software builders. Stick to what you know and explore all your options  
**[1:00:33-1:00:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:00:33):**  because there are many, many, many options, but educate yourself, know what you're talking  
**[1:00:40-1:00:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:00:40):**  about when you talk to a software developer so you know what he's saying and he's not  
**[1:00:44-1:00:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:00:44):**  your doctor so you don't have to do exactly what he tells you.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:00:48):**  Sounds like you've learned some great lessons on the product management side.  
**[1:00:53-1:00:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:00:53):**  Expensive lessons, Sarah. Expensive. Yes.  
**[1:00:56-1:01:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:00:56):**  I've heard that and felt that pain before as well. Actually, promised my last question  
**[1:01:01-1:01:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:01:01):**  for you, Anthony. How would you even introduce yourself? How would you describe your current  
**[1:01:05-1:01:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:01:05):**  role because you're clearly wearing a number of hats and involved in quite a few projects  
**[1:01:08-1:01:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:01:08):**  and initiatives? Yeah. We do cover quite a little bit. Look  
**[1:01:14-1:01:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:01:14):**  at my favourite role and the number one role that I hope that we will always have is boots  
**[1:01:22-1:01:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:01:22):**  on the ground. Really, really working closely with growers and helping them get started  
**[1:01:31-1:01:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:01:31):**  and then obviously mentoring them and helping them, providing that support that they haven't  
**[1:01:36-1:01:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:01:36):**  had through their precision Ag quest. That's my favourite part of things. We also cover  
**[1:01:45-1:01:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:01:45):**  software development and some research and a number of other little umbrellas there.  
**[1:01:54-1:02:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:01:54):**  I think where we are, where we want to be at this stage is really at the start, at the  
**[1:02:01-1:02:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:02:01):**  coalface with the growers and sitting with them in the office and bashing our heads against  
**[1:02:07-1:02:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:02:07):**  the table together. Hopefully not for too long or too hard. So  
**[1:02:11-1:02:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:02:11):**  you and that we in that sense, is that IAG or is that wearing a different hat?  
**[1:02:16-1:02:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:02:16):**  That's IAG. Yeah. So that's where IAG. We haven't moved from that space. That was our  
**[1:02:23-1:02:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:02:23):**  idea to start with. That's where we knew we had to be. I don't think there's anybody else  
**[1:02:28-1:02:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:02:28):**  really in that space. I think the fact that I've had both the dealership experience and  
**[1:02:39-1:02:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:02:39):**  the software development experience puts me in a fairly good place there. I truly can  
**[1:02:47-1:02:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:02:47):**  understand where growers are coming from when they vent their frustration. Especially in  
**[1:02:55-1:02:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:02:55):**  those interviews that we record, they're quite entertaining.  
**[1:02:59-1:03:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:02:59):**  I bet. I bet. I bet there's some funny insights there and some social media worthy frustrations.  
**[1:03:09-1:03:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:03:09):**  We have some characters. There's no doubt about that. Sarah?  
**[1:03:13-1:03:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:03:13):**  Cool. Thank you for talking to me. I know we went all over the place there. But I learned  
**[1:03:19-1:03:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:03:19):**  a few things and definitely interesting to hear your perspective. Clearly have tons of  
**[1:03:23-1:03:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:03:23):**  experience in this space. Appreciate you sharing the insights.  
**[1:03:27-1:03:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:03:27):**  No, look, thanks for having me. I've enjoyed it immensely. I could talk about it for another  
**[1:03:32-1:03:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357323#t=1:03:32):**  two hours. It wouldn't worry me in the least. Thank you for joining us on another episode

**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:01:36):**  In the book, Rob argues that food policy rather than farm policy should be the main focus

**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:01:46):**  I am very much looking forward to talk to you.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:01:49):**  You have been probably more influential on my journey than you perhaps know.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:01:52):**  And I enjoyed pulling out a couple of your books from the bookshelf this past week or  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:01:57):**  two to dig back into them and check them out.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:01:59):**  So I'm really looking forward to this.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:00):**  But I wanted to start with a little bit on your background.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:03):**  Where did you grow up and how did you get involved in agriculture?  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:07):**  Well, it came through my family.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:10):**  My father grew up on a small family farm in Indiana and then went on to become an agricultural  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:17):**  economist and then a senior government official working in the area of agriculture.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:23):**  And my father's brother managed the university farms at Purdue University.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:28):**  So it's kind of a family business.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:30):**  I was lucky.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:31):**  I had a chance when I was a teenager to spend some summers working on my uncle's farm in  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:37):**  Indiana, the farm my dad grew up in.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:39):**  And I enjoyed it a great deal.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:41):**  It was, you know, I wasn't old enough to drive a car, but there I was driving a truck.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:49):**  And you get to work with dangerous powered machinery and animals four times your size.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:55):**  It made me feel grown up.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:56):**  And I learned to admire the skill set that my uncle and my cousins had to manage all  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:04):**  of the different complex operations of a diverse family farm.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:09):**  So later on, when I got a degree in political science and started teaching international  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:14):**  relations, it didn't take me long to realize that I didn't really have much of an advantage  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:19):**  pushing on that path.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:21):**  I had experiences and I had a heritage that was unique to people in political science  
**[0:03:26-0:03:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:26):**  and international relations.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:27):**  And I should make use of that, which is what I've done.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:31):**  When you read Rob's books, it's easy to tell he's passionate about agriculture.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:35):**  But what makes them stand out to me is how well researched they are.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:39):**  In chasing the evidence, though, he's found himself often in a gray area, landing in a  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:44):**  middle, sometimes no man's land between heated sides of food and farm policy debates.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:50):**  The first of Rob's books that I read back when I took his course was called Food Politics,  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:55):**  What Everyone Needs to Know.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:57):**  And it goes through commonly asked questions about everything from obesity to urban ag  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:04:01):**  to biotech, biofuels and climate change.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:04:04):**  I found and still find this book to be incredibly helpful as an ag 101.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:04:09):**  However, not everyone was happy with Where Rob Lands.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:04:13):**  I enjoy finding something new.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:04:15):**  And sometimes the evidence takes me in a controversial direction.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:04:19):**  But that's OK, because I'm not bidding for a position inside some government somewhere.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:04:25):**  The book did get some pushback from advocacy groups who didn't like my take on agroecology.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:04:34):**  In particular, I wasn't going to say that we should return to hand gardening in agriculture.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:04:43):**  We shouldn't try to imitate nature.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:04:46):**  We shouldn't do away with powered machinery and fertilizers.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:04:50):**  I didn't want to go back to an agroecological approach.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:04:54):**  I was impressed with the gains from the Green Revolution in Asia and Latin America, more  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:02):**  in Asia than in Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:06):**  And I said that outright in the book, that there wasn't much evidence yet that agroecology  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:10):**  was pulling farmers out of poverty anywhere or feeding anybody anywhere in a substantial  
**[0:05:16-0:05:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:16):**  way.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:17):**  And there's a huge push now for agroecology.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:21):**  And by not getting on that bandwagon, I became a target for criticism.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:27):**  The criticism was largely couched in a complaint that there weren't any footnotes in the book,  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:34):**  but there weren't any footnotes in the whole series of books.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:37):**  So I didn't take that personally.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:39):**  And probably the pushback helped sell a few more books.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:43):**  Yeah, I'm sure.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:44):**  Yeah, that's it's sort of free marketing, I suppose.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:47):**  One of the things you talk about that I'm curious to have you explain if you're up for  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:50):**  it is something that is not intuitive, I think, to most people around the role of farm subsidies  
**[0:05:55-0:05:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:55):**  on the price of food.

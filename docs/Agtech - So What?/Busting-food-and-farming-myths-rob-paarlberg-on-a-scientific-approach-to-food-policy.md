### Agtech - So What?  (2021-02-10)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  If you've ever struggled to get the facts straight around some of the controversial  
**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:00:12):**  issues in food and agriculture, then you need to meet our next guest.  Robert Prowlberg is a political scientist and an author, and his books turn some of  the popular myths around food and farming policy completely on their head.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:00:25):**  I'm always concerned when I hear smart people describe modern farming as energy intensive,  as resource intensive, as heavily polluting, as a source of obesity, as something that  has torn the fabric of rural society, something that tortures animals.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:00:50):**  There's a lot of, there's evidence for some of those things, but there's a lot of evidence  against most of those things.  Rob is also an associate in the sustainability science program at the Harvard Kennedy School.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:01:02):**  He was actually my professor when I took his global food politics and policy course back  in grad school.  And as you just heard, Rob rejects the claims that modern ag is to blame for many of today's  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:01:12):**  environmental and social harms.  Rather than a return to how we used to farm hundreds or thousands of years ago, he advocates  for continued innovation and technological advancement.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:01:23):**  But he doesn't believe we have it all right today either.  His newly released book, Resetting the Table, Straight Talk About the Food We Grow and Eat,  is already getting good reviews, as well as ruffling a few feathers.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:01:36):**  In the book, Rob argues that food policy rather than farm policy should be the main focus  of action and reform when it comes to the American food system.  Fantastic.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:01:45):**  Thanks, Rob.  I am very much looking forward to talk to you.  You have been probably more influential on my journey than you perhaps know.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:01:52):**  And I enjoyed pulling out a couple of your books from the bookshelf this past week or  two to dig back into them and check them out.  So I'm really looking forward to this.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:00):**  But I wanted to start with a little bit on your background.  Where did you grow up and how did you get involved in agriculture?  Well, it came through my family.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:10):**  My father grew up on a small family farm in Indiana and then went on to become an agricultural  economist and then a senior government official working in the area of agriculture.  And my father's brother managed the university farms at Purdue University.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:28):**  So it's kind of a family business.  I was lucky.  I had a chance when I was a teenager to spend some summers working on my uncle's farm in  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:37):**  Indiana, the farm my dad grew up in.  And I enjoyed it a great deal.  It was, you know, I wasn't old enough to drive a car, but there I was driving a truck.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:02:49):**  And you get to work with dangerous powered machinery and animals four times your size.  It made me feel grown up.  And I learned to admire the skill set that my uncle and my cousins had to manage all  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:04):**  of the different complex operations of a diverse family farm.  So later on, when I got a degree in political science and started teaching international  relations, it didn't take me long to realize that I didn't really have much of an advantage  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:19):**  pushing on that path.  I had experiences and I had a heritage that was unique to people in political science  and international relations.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:27):**  And I should make use of that, which is what I've done.  When you read Rob's books, it's easy to tell he's passionate about agriculture.  But what makes them stand out to me is how well researched they are.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:39):**  In chasing the evidence, though, he's found himself often in a gray area, landing in a  middle, sometimes no man's land between heated sides of food and farm policy debates.  The first of Rob's books that I read back when I took his course was called Food Politics,  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:03:55):**  What Everyone Needs to Know.  And it goes through commonly asked questions about everything from obesity to urban ag  to biotech, biofuels and climate change.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:04:04):**  I found and still find this book to be incredibly helpful as an ag 101.  However, not everyone was happy with Where Rob Lands.  I enjoy finding something new.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:04:15):**  And sometimes the evidence takes me in a controversial direction.  But that's OK, because I'm not bidding for a position inside some government somewhere.  The book did get some pushback from advocacy groups who didn't like my take on agroecology.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:04:34):**  In particular, I wasn't going to say that we should return to hand gardening in agriculture.  We shouldn't try to imitate nature.  We shouldn't do away with powered machinery and fertilizers.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:04:50):**  I didn't want to go back to an agroecological approach.  I was impressed with the gains from the Green Revolution in Asia and Latin America, more  in Asia than in Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:06):**  And I said that outright in the book, that there wasn't much evidence yet that agroecology  was pulling farmers out of poverty anywhere or feeding anybody anywhere in a substantial  way.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:17):**  And there's a huge push now for agroecology.  And by not getting on that bandwagon, I became a target for criticism.  The criticism was largely couched in a complaint that there weren't any footnotes in the book,  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:34):**  but there weren't any footnotes in the whole series of books.  So I didn't take that personally.  And probably the pushback helped sell a few more books.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:43):**  Yeah, I'm sure.  Yeah, that's it's sort of free marketing, I suppose.  One of the things you talk about that I'm curious to have you explain if you're up for  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:50):**  it is something that is not intuitive, I think, to most people around the role of farm subsidies  on the price of food.  And people think that sort of distorts the market.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:05:59):**  Can you talk a little bit about that?  Yeah, everybody intuitively thinks, oh, well, farm subsidies, that must make food cheap.  But the purpose of farm subsidies is to increase the income of farmers.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:06:14):**  And often the best way to do that is to drive up the price of agricultural commodities.  And that's done either by placing restrictions on imports, that's probably the most common  approach, or by taking cropland out of production, or sometimes by mandating the use of agricultural  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:06:32):**  commodities for non-food uses, like in the corn-based ethanol fuel standard program in  the United States.  Everyone who reads Michael Pollan comes away assuming that farm subsidies have given America  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:06:46):**  a plague of cheap corn.  I think that was the phrase that he uses.  He doesn't somehow miss the fact that 40% of our corn acreage is diverted for the production  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:06:58):**  of ethanol.  So that doesn't enter the food supply.  Or take a look at sugar.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:07:04):**  Here's the most obesity-inducing commodity of all.  But by keeping cheap foreign sugar, including some foreign sugar from Australia, out of  the US market, the price of sugar in the United States is 60% or 70% higher than the world  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:07:19):**  market price.  So farm subsidies make food artificially expensive, not artificially cheap.  I'm curious to your view, one of the things we've had on the podcast recently is pushback  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:07:31):**  on, I would call it maybe a philosophy of subsidies around, you know, if farmers are  running a business, then how much should we subsidize them and how much kind of government  handouts are they getting?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:07:43):**  And especially in an Australian context where subsidies work really differently, there's  often a sort of, oh, those US guys are on easy street kind of conversation.  What would your response to that be?  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:07:55):**  Well looking at the experience of the last couple of years, I'd have to agree with a  lot of Australians.  I mean, in the United States, we have something called the Commodity Credit Corporation, the  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:08:06):**  CCC.  It's a government corporation that is entitled to borrow money from our Treasury Department  with very little limitation.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:08:18):**  And so when President Trump starts a trade war with China that ends up hurting US hog  producers and US soybean growers, he can, without an act of Congress, he can ask his  Secretary of Agriculture to pull billions and billions and billions of dollars out of  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:08:37):**  the Commodity Credit Corporation and send it to farmers as checks.  And I don't think it's responsible government.  I don't think the trade war was responsible policy, but I certainly don't like this as  
**[0:08:49-0:08:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:08:49):**  a precedent.  I wish we had a little more discipline inside the US.  It's good to have safety net systems, but we're now thinking about using the Commodity  
**[0:08:58-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:08:58):**  Credit Corporation to finance a new carbon bank to promote carbon soil sequestration.  And I don't think the science is there yet to demonstrate that this is a project worthy  of government subsidies.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:09:20):**  I think the government, I mean, I'm enough of an economist to believe that the role of  the government is to produce public goods rather than private goods.  And in agriculture, the most important of these, in my view, is research.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:09:35):**  I wish we spent a lot more on agriculture research.  In addition to how much we spend on ag research, we also have to think about what it's spent  on to maximize outcomes for farmers and industry.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:09:48):**  And this is a big debate, especially in Australia, for example, where ag research ranks really  highly globally, but the system struggles with commercialization.  The economics here are interesting.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:09:59):**  Some problems, whether in Australia or the US, just might not be big enough to attract  the interest of governments or large corporations to solve.  Rob gives an example of another approach, farmers working directly with startups.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:10:13):**  What sometimes happens is that the growers pool their resources and task a private company  coming up with a technical solution.  We've seen this in the United States now with the automation of strawberry picking.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:10:30):**  The Central Valley in California, there's been a labor shortage for the last four or  five years and strawberry growers can't get pickers.  And so they've had to leave their crops unpicked on occasion.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:10:43):**  And the market isn't big enough to be of interest to John Deere.  The problem with robotics in the picking of fruits and vegetables is that each fruit has  a different architecture and requires a different engineering solution.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:11:03):**  And if the market for peaches isn't very big, no one's going to invest in automating the  peach harvest.  So strawberry growers in California put their own money together and they have a lot of  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:11:14):**  money and they found a company in Florida that was willing to develop a robotic strawberry  picking machine.  It's called the Harvest Crew, C-R-O-O.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:11:25):**  And they hope it's going to be deployed next year sometime.  It's fantastic because it picks night and day.  Is GPS precise?  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:11:37):**  Each plant in the field has a different set of GPS coordinates.  So the machine knows exactly where it is at all times.  And it could solve a lot of labor problems for strawberry pickers in California.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:11:47):**  But it wasn't done by the federal government.  It wasn't done by a big company.  It was financed by the growers themselves.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:11:56):**  This California strawberry story is a good example of American culture taking responsibility  and finding a way to solve problems on your own without the need for government intervention.  But Rob argues that there can be a downside to America's focus on personal responsibility,  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:12:11):**  especially when we look at the obesity epidemic and climate change.  The real puzzle occurred to me when I looked at the United States versus the rich countries  on the continent of Europe.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:12:24):**  It's two different worlds.  Obesity prevalence in the United States is twice as high, twice as high as it is on the  continent of Europe.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:12:31):**  And per capita CO2 emissions in the United States are twice as high as they were on the  continent of Europe.  So I said to myself, OK, what explains this?  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:12:42):**  And of course, there are a lot of different reasons.  But I ended up concentrating on what was distinct about America's political culture.  It's a political culture that has it's good for producing abundance.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:12:57):**  It's a political culture that that values liberty and freedom over security.  It's a political culture that wants small government rather than big government.  It wants personal responsibility rather than state responsibility.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:13:15):**  It's a political culture that doesn't like taxes and doesn't like regulations.  And this is marvelous.  If the goal is innovation and the creation of abundance, this is the path to do it.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:13:27):**  But when it comes to limiting food consumption, you may need some soda taxes or some regulatory  structures to tell companies they can't advertise junk food to children on Saturday morning,  television.

**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:13:48):**  European countries tax fossil fuels and gasoline.  Even Canada taxes gasoline dramatically more than the United States.  The United States doesn't tax food.

And as a result, we haven't been able to rein in our overconsumption of food or fuel.  Our culture is, OK, we're going to innovate our way out of this problem.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:14:18):**  We're not going to moderate our way out.  We're going to innovate our way out with bariatric surgeries or new treatments for type two diabetes  or new extra resilient coastal infrastructures to get ready for the next flooding storm.

It's their fault if they're eating too much.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:14:43):**  And I think to myself, well, wait a minute.  Obesity rates in the United States today are three times as high as they were in the 1960s.  Are we three times as irresponsible as we were in the 1960s?  
**[0:14:58-0:15:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:14:58):**  No, no, no, no, no.  It's not that at all.  Rob tackles these issues and why U.S. culture and policy in particular can be problematic

I don't blame it on farmers or farm subsidies.  Obesity doesn't come from the farm.

And it's almost impossible for a certain segment of the population to moderate their consumption.  Here again, Rob unpacks the research to tackle some commonly referenced food myths.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:16:03):**  There was a time when everyone said that, well, low income Americans are obese because  they live in food deserts.  They don't have access to healthy fruits and vegetables because there aren't enough supermarkets.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:16:15):**  Well, good researchers took a look at that and concluded that no, no, no, that's not  it at all.  It's not the absence of supermarkets.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:16:24):**  It's the presence of too many unhealthy foods in fast food restaurants, corner bodegas,  supermarkets have plenty of unhealthy foods.  And now one of the most dangerous shopping venues for unhealthy foods is pharmacies.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:16:43):**  When I go to get a prescription, I have to walk through aisles packed with candy bars,  chips, soda, in order to get to the pharmacy counter.  So a CVS patron can now try to protect their health and ruin their health in a single visit.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:17:03):**  It's called a food swamp and scholars have measured the importance of food swamps as  opposed to food deserts.  They find food deserts make almost no difference to the diet.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:17:15):**  Put a supermarket into a neighborhood that didn't have one, eating patterns barely change  at all.  It's the presence of so many unhealthy foods that have been formulated to be addictive  
**[0:17:25-0:17:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:17:25):**  and virtually irresistible.  One of the things you talk about kind of following on from that is the importance of a focus  on food policy as much or more than on farm policy.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:17:37):**  What are some of the things that you are, you think we should do there?  Yeah, I think a good food policy in the United States would include excise taxes on sugar  sweetened beverages.

And in each case it has brought down the consumption of sugar sweetened beverages and increased

**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:18:31):**  I wouldn't reduce the size of the benefit one bit, but I would not make sugar sweetened  beverages eligible for purchase in our SNAP program.  I would also place restrictions on advertising of unhealthy foods to children.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:18:47):**  Some European countries don't allow the advertising of anything to children or any foods at least.  I would start down that path as well.  And I would start with voluntary, but try to move toward mandatory requirements that

There's a lot of, there's evidence for some of those things, but there's a lot of evidence  against most of those things.

**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:20:56):**  gone digital and like other industries, we're much less resource intensive than we used  to be dramatically.  So if you look at, look at corn production in the United States, we're producing five

**[0:21:18-0:21:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:21:18):**  In American agriculture since 1980, fertilizer use has remained essentially flat while production  has increased by almost 50%.  It's the same for irrigation.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:21:32):**  If you look at pesticides in American agriculture since 1980, pesticide use has declined by  18% in real terms, even as production has increased by nearly half.  In insecticides specifically, people don't realize insecticide use in American agriculture  
**[0:21:51-0:21:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:21:51):**  today is 80% below where it was in 1972.  These are, I think these are significant achievements and we can continue and we should.  It bothers me when people say we should go back to a more traditional style of farming  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:22:12):**  and abandon these applications of modern science.  I think these applications of science have been our salvation.  You have to remember in the United States, traditional low yield farming had already  
**[0:22:24-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:22:24):**  become unsustainable in the 1930s when we expanded low yield cropping into the Southern  Plains in Oklahoma and elsewhere.  The result, it was a drought prone region.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:22:36):**  We had a drought, we had a dust bowl.  We didn't finally stop expanding cropland area in the United States until we had hybrid  seeds in the 1940s and 1950s.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:22:48):**  So I think people who want to go back to traditional farming are fooling themselves.  They're mistaken.  It won't work.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:22:57):**  We're producing three times as much now as we did in 1940.  If we tried to produce that much more using the traditional methods of 1940, we'd have  to cut down our remaining forests and plow up all of our fragile land and it would destroy  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:23:14):**  wildlife habitat galore and pretty soon we'd have a real silent spring.  So explaining this to people who've never spent any time on a modern commercial farm  is extremely difficult.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:23:27):**  It's not their fault.  They believe what they hear.  They believe and they visit small organic farms in the countryside on the weekend and

**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:23:44):**  Yeah, it's really interesting.  I guess some of the pushback I can imagine to what you've just said is, well, we still  do have challenges in nitrogen leaching or in monocultures or in the soil degradation  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:23:59):**  or in biodiversity loss or any number of things.  But what would you say to some of the pushback?  I agree it's not good enough, but I wouldn't want to go back to the way it used to be because  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:24:13):**  you can't produce as much food as we're producing now with the low yield methods of the past  without doing even more environmental damage.  So I think larger investments in research are the pathway to reducing the environmental  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:24:29):**  damage even more than we have.  One other pathway is to, and this is also a research investment.  This one was private sector led, is to substitute plant-based imitation meats and cell cultured  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:24:47):**  meats for meat from living animals.  I think this is a very promising approach in my view.  You bring down the greenhouse gas signature of a pound of meat by more than 90% if you  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:25:00):**  switch from a regular beef hamburger to an impossible burger or a beyond burger.  And we're only just getting started in this area.  I mean, the fashion industry was able to reduce its use of real animal fur by developing synthetic  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:25:17):**  furs.  The shoe industry was able to reduce its use of real animal hide by developing synthetic  leather products.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:25:25):**  So the food industry is already developing non-dairy milk products that are pretty close  to milk.  They come from plants.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:25:35):**  They come from rice or almonds or coconuts.  We have plant-based egg products now that are very good and we're moving toward plant-based  meat products as well.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:25:45):**  So that's another pathway of escape from not just from the environmental problems associated  with livestock production, but the animal welfare problems as well.  My new book has a chapter on animal welfare and it's an unsolved problem in American agriculture.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:26:01):**  I celebrate crop farming a lot more than I celebrate livestock production.  Livestock production has made exactly the same kinds of environmental gains that crop  farming has with much greater feed use efficiency and better genetics.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:26:18):**  Dairy production, for example, releases far fewer climate-threatening gases, methane and  CO2 than in the past.  One atmospheric scientist at UC Davis has calculated that the climate burden of a single

But you have to worry about the excessive confinement of the animals, particularly in  pork production and with egg laying hens.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:26:49):**  And there, I think the livestock sector has a long way to go.  But the path is visible ahead.  I was in Europe when I was doing research for this book and I visited a hog farm in  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:27:01):**  the Netherlands and they have much higher standards when it comes to the housing of  pigs.  And it sounds expensive when you describe it, but it's entirely affordable.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:27:14):**  Housing costs, it turns out, are only 10% of production costs in pig farming in Europe.  So if the housing costs go up a little bit, the pig farms can survive.  Europe raises twice as many pigs as the United States.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:27:26):**  So we don't have to worry about our industry disappearing if we begin to use some of their  standards.  The most curious one of all, but one that I respect a great deal, is a requirement that  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:27:38):**  pigs have to be given toys.  What do you think about that?  A good requirement?  
**[0:27:45-0:27:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:27:45):**  Absolutely.  These animals are far more intelligent than dogs and cats.  They're subject to boredom if they don't have stimulation.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:27:56):**  If they're poorly treated, you can see the stereotypic behaviors chewing on the bars  of the cage and pacing back and forth.  If they can root around in something, they're much happier.

**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:28:17):**  It's always really refreshing, Rob, to talk to you because some of these views like the  advocacy for plant-based protein or animal welfare, but also with a pretty strong view  on modern biotechnology and scaling up existing forms of production.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:28:34):**  Sometimes the people that advocate for those things don't sit in the same room or speak  nicely to each other, but you advocate for both.  What does that mean in terms of pushback or criticism you get?  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:28:45):**  Are you off in the corner by yourself?  We're getting dangerously close to the truth here.  I don't preach to the choir because I don't have a choir, but I hope people can look at  
**[0:28:58-0:29:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:28:58):**  my work as a cafeteria line and take what they find interesting and useful and leave  the rest behind.  I do get frustrated.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:29:08):**  Back to plant-based imitation meats, you would think that the leaders of the new food movement  who are harshly critical of the livestock industry would have embraced this innovation,  but they haven't.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:29:26):**  They've criticized it harshly because these products are ultra-processed.  They come from profit-making corporations and they're not traditional.  The new food movement wants to go back to something recognizable from the past.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:29:44):**  They want a small, local, diverse, chemical-free, organic, artisanal farms.  That's what will make them happy.  When they see a technology-based solution waiting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  
**[0:30:01-0:30:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:30:01):**  by 90% and solve animal welfare problems completely, they're too attached to their, I think, antiquated  values to see the opportunity.  But to be clear, Rob isn't against small or organic farms either.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:30:18):**  I raised the argument that, well, if people want and are willing to pay for certain qualities,  then isn't it just good business to give the consumer what they want?  Oh, I agree with that completely.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:30:29):**  I believe in multi-agriculturalism.  There's so many different kinds of farms that I'm happy with, including full-time commercial  farms, but also retirement farms, part-time farms, hobby farms, and also local small,  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:30:46):**  diverse organic farms.  But the economist in me says we have to be realistic about how far that's going to scale  up.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:30:55):**  In the United States today, organically grown products have been heavily promoted for two  decades.  They're very popular with consumers.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:31:06):**  Consumers are willing to pay a lot more for organic.  And yet farmers don't like growing crops without nitrogen fertilizer.  And so very few farmers have switched to organic.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:31:16):**  So only 1% of harvested cropland in the United States today is certified organic, only 1%.  Only 2% of farm sales in the United States are sales of organic products.  It's not going to scale up as long as you have what I think is a needlessly rigid restriction  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:31:37):**  against any use at all of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer.  I mean, it makes sense in many cases to reduce the use of nitrogen fertilizer and to reduce  it dramatically.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:31:48):**  But to reduce it to zero is completely arbitrary.  There's no scientific foundation for that.  It turns out that people want more choice.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:32:00):**  They want more convenience.  They want tropical products in the wintertime that you can't get locally.  Our food system is becoming more global, not more local.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:32:11):**  In 1990, the United States imported 11% of its food.  Now it's closer to 20%.  So we're not becoming local.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:32:20):**  We're becoming more global.  And I'm all for that.  Without those imports, food availability in the marketplace would be much less supportive  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/10/busting-food-and-farming-myths-with-evidence#t=0:32:30):**  of a healthy, balanced diet.

### Agtech - So What?  (2020-07-29)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome back to the Ag Tech So What podcast, brought to you by Agthentic.  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  Today we are back with episode two in our series on regenerative agriculture or regen  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:14):**  ag.  We had awesome feedback on our first episode featuring Mark Wooten of Jigsaw Farms, who  is you might say not a fan of the term regen ag.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:26):**  And today's guest has a very different view.  Sam Chithui is an Australian farmer and entrepreneur who was actually on the podcast way back in  episode seven.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:37):**  But we've invited him back to talk about his latest venture, Tasmanian Agriculture  Company, or the Taz Ag Co, where he's combining his knowledge of startups with his passion  for farming to produce grass fed wagyu beef, all without actually owning any cows.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:55):**  Sam in this episode covers how Taz Ag Co got started, how the business model uses insights  from his time in the ag tech world, what it's like to register a soil carbon project, his  views on regen ag, and his message for any regen ag skeptics out there.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:14):**  Sam starts with an overview of what they're up to at Taz Ag Co.  So we run a company called the Tasmanian Agricultural Company, and we do a beyond sustainable beef  product.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:26):**  It's essentially a grass fed wagyu animal.  We farm in a regenerative way.  And I mean, we can talk about this too, regenerative is a fairly loose term and you know what it  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:33):**  actually means to certain people and produces kind of varies.  But for us, it means that we follow a fairly regimented time controlled grazing system,  or cell grazing is more commonly known.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:44):**  We also use a lot of multi species crops across our farm.  And we also moved away from insecticides, fungicides, most herbicides and all synthetic  fertilizer.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:55):**  We'll come back to more of Sam's views on regen ag, but I wanted to jump to how they  got started.  Just a couple of years ago, Sam was working in the startup world as general manager and  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:07):**  co founder of SproutX, Australia's first ag tech accelerator.  But even at that time, he was feeling the pull to start something himself.  I suppose I just miss production.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:19):**  I miss being on farm, I miss the outdoors.  And I mean, some people say it's your blood or whatever.  But first and foremost, I wanted to do something that was mine or that was ours in our family  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:29):**  unit and build something on the sake of making everyone else money.  And for me personally, just connecting back with nature was a really big thing.  Sam and his wife, Steph started with the demand side, as in the consumer from the very beginning.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:45):**  Steph, my wife, when we were planning this business said, well, what's after grass fed?  Like what's the next thing?  And for us, it was carbon positive beef or beef that's produced in a way that actually  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:55):**  heals and encourages the environment to do what it's supposed to do.  So yeah, that's kind of where it all came about.  And I mean, we're actually processing our first animal this weekend as a trial and a  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:05):**  test, which is kind of grim when you pick the first one out.  But that's I suppose what we're here to do.  And yeah, it's gonna be really exciting to see kind of this time next week, we would  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:14):**  have tasted our first product, which is going to be pretty intense.  It'll be two and a half years of work.  What are you testing for?  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:22):**  Tenderness.  So yeah, no eating quality, really, and to see how the marbling is going.  I checked in with Sam as I was pulling together this episode, and he said the test went well,  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:34):**  which is important as they've changed things up at Taz Ag Co in quite a few ways, borrowing  insights about business models and finance from the startup world and applying them to  agriculture.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:45):**  Our business is, I would argue, is quite innovative in most of the ways in which we operate.  So the way we're structured, the way we raised our capital, the way we have structured  our operations company and our property company, our prop co and op co.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:58):**  And I suppose into that point, the way we produce, having watched the startups be very  effective at getting big heavy things off their balance sheet, because therefore, if  you've got heavy things on your balance sheet, you've got to raise more money and therefore  
**[0:04:09-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:09):**  give away more equity, right?  And I hate to use these cliched examples of air, B&B and Uber, but you've got the biggest  transport company in the world doesn't own a car, that whole thing.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:19):**  How can we be a big beef producer and not own a cow?  So we actually put out our high growth waggies into dairies.  They don't want half their calf drop.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:28):**  They actually kill them under a week old.  And so they've got an animal welfare issue.  And we therefore pivot a waste product into a high value product.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:36):**  And we essentially breed cattle without owning cows.  So that's been a really cool part of our business.  And one of the things I probably underestimated, you know, they'd say keep it simple, stupid  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:46):**  and all that stuff.  But it's actually become a very complex, difficult kind of production model that we've had to  kind of really clamp down on if we're to produce a consistent quality kind of premium beef  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:56):**  product.  There are a couple of key things on the finance side that had to come together to get this  model to work.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:02):**  And again, Sam has drawn on business examples from outside of agriculture for inspiration.  The PropCo is my wife and I, the Tasmanian government have got an amazing loan for new  or young farmers at an interest rate that's better than I can get off family.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:18):**  So we've got that set up with the TassieGov.  We then went and raised equity capital for the actual operations company.  And I suppose if you think about it, a farming business is actually not worth anything as  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:28):**  a business.  It's a bunch of capital and human capital that have been put together to produce a commodity.  The actual underlying business, unlike a takeaway shop on the corner, you can put a valuation  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:39):**  on a takeaway shop or a startup as hard as that may be.  But a farming business isn't actually worth anything.  And so I suppose if we're getting an investor into a beef business, that's where the marketing  
**[0:05:50-0:05:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:50):**  piece comes in.  So the value of our business actually sits in the brand and as a marketing house and  big fan of brands and so have kind of built our future plans around a virgin type kind  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:02):**  of model when we're kind of trying to lift the value of that intangible brand.  Sam is referring to Richard Branson and The Virgin Group, a multinational conglomerate  famous for its complex structure, sometimes called the House of Brands.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:16):**  Back to Sam and a few more areas of the business model where they've shaken things up.  The way we finance the calves is quite innovative too.  So again, I suppose you've got to remember, Steph and I don't have a lot of equity really  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:28):**  at all and we had to kind of create this from nothing.  So we went to a known debt provider in the livestock world and their interest rates were  like double digits, which is pretty crazy given the cash rate.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:42):**  So we went to the private debt market through family, friends and other contacts.  Again learned all this stuff through my time in VC and in Ag Tech and yeah, basically raised  debt capital.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:52):**  I think we're paying about 8% at the moment and therefore we can buy the calves with that  debt and then the calf will be processed as a yearling at 18 to 20 months old.  At that point, that's when we pay back the principal and the interest.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:07):**  So that means that from a cashflow point of view, we don't have to pay regular interest  payments.  We do it at the end in a big lump sum and so it's in a cost of ownership of around $70  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:17):**  a head, which is pretty palatable.  So that's quite innovative.  Then the way we're structuring our future lease payments too, it looks like as an early  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:26):**  starting position, we're working with some investors where we actually pay leased on  the farm's ability to produce feed.  So it'll be much like a lease that I've seen in the McDonald's business.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:36):**  So McDonald's franchisees pay lease to McDonald's corporation based on a percentage of their  gross sales for the month.  So they have a floating rent payment and so we're going to be doing that on the land,  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:46):**  which is exciting.  We have poorer rainfall and even a drought and therefore our productivity is low.  We don't pay as much rent, which is perfect.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:54):**  But then of course, happy to share the upside in a really good season.  So we're just being really innovative in every which way we can.  Is that related to the season or how does that tie in with management practice?  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:05):**  Like if you're doing better by the land and natural capital, whether it's storing carbon,  better coverage, et cetera, do you get rewarded for that in some way?  Or is that just through yield and over time resilience?  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:20):**  Yeah, no, it's a great question.  And that's where actually I've got a meeting in an hour and a half to nut more of this  out because if you did it just on the farm's ability to produce feed, there are lots of  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:30):**  variables that can come into that.  So we are looking at a way, an output figure, which is a result of increasing soil health  along with the fact that figures probably marked to rainfall.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:41):**  So we might have an increase in soil health and soil carbon over time, which increases  water holding capacity and nutrient density, but have a below average rainfall year, but  we still maintain healthy carrying capacity on that property.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:55):**  So what it's looking like is it'll be linked to animal days per hectare, per hundred mill  of rain or something along those lines.  Are you able to do that and even consider that because it's outside of the traditional  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:07):**  kind of bank and livestock finance?  Is that just private agreements that you guys will be able to get up with people who believe  in this kind of thing?  
**[0:09:15-0:09:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:15):**  Yes, absolutely.  So the kind of investors we're working with are generally kind of regeneratively focused  and want to see farming change.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:23):**  And more excitingly, they want to be a part of that story.  They want to be a part of our story.  And they are really excited about our background in our team, which I suppose talks to your  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:33):**  world a lot.  You know, you invest in the team.  Beyond some of the feel good aspects of Regen Ag that are so often sold, Sam has focused  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:43):**  on building an evidence base to back up different claims.  For us, with my Ag Tech background, it is about building data.  The issue with regenerative agriculture is there's not enough data.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:54):**  So if you're a US pension fund and you want to invest in, you know, you want to chuck  a billion US dollars into Australian agriculture, which there's one or two have, you're only  going to put it into a conventional agricultural system, whether that's in wheat, walnuts,  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:08):**  dairy, beef, because there's the data.  There's 60, 70 years of production data and performance data that you know you're going  to get your return.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:17):**  There's obviously no assessment done on the environmental cost of that return.  And that's where we're starting to see some people say, well, we'd like to invest in a  different type of farming, but you can't show me five to 10 or three years of evidence that  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:30):**  suggests that you can produce as much food or more, or at least commit to a return on  investment.  So that for me is our kind of part of our end game and our scalability plans.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:43):**  So Sam has gone outside of the traditional finance world to get what we might call true  believers on board.  Those first investors who believe in something before it even exists.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:54):**  But like for most startups, raising money is not easy.  I suppose like a lot of things, it has been a slog.  But it's funny once you get a few runs on the board and you're in the paper and online  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:08):**  and all of a sudden people start to notice and you then attract like minded people who  and all of a sudden, I wouldn't say things are snowballing quite so much yet, but they're  moving without a lot of pushing, I suppose is the best way to put it.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:22):**  But yeah, to be honest, Sarah, I mean, the first, I mean, my capital raising, I mean,  I did it with SproutX and they've done it with other projects.  This is obviously very different.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:31):**  And yeah, the capital raising piece for Tazaco is one of the worst experiences of my professional  life.  I used to watch the startups do it and it's just such a grueling process and you've just  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:42):**  got to get used to hearing no and used to, you know, you've got to kiss a lot of frogs.  And so yeah, I don't want to do that again anytime soon.  And hopefully I'll get my career to a point where I can prove my worth through projects  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:54):**  and traction that people will come to me and say, Hey, I've got 5 million bucks.  I think we should do something together.  What do you reckon?  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:01):**  Yeah, that's always the goal.  Just get people throwing money at you.  I want to go back to the data piece.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:06):**  How do you guys, how are you guys doing that from a kind of tech or data perspective?  Is it, is it different tools, spreadsheets, off the shelf stuff, custom stuff?  How have you thought about building that base of evidence?  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:18):**  Our main farm management platform is actually my grazing.  So that enables actually what we were talking about earlier.  It enables me to calculate those stock days per hectare per hundred millire and all that  
**[0:12:28-0:12:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:28):**  stuff.  And that's the main farm management piece that we're using, which will over time show  where we were at from a stocking capacity and where we can go.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:36):**  So it actually kind of does a lot of what we need something to do.  I'm actually just saving up or trying to find some ways to invest in some into some better  weather technology monitoring and look, it's only a couple of gram, but it's, you know,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:49):**  being a startup, it's another, another two or three grand that I've got to find and justify.  So, and we've also got a, we're quite lucky.  We've got a Bureau of Meteorology, rainfall weather station about a kilometer away.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:59):**  So it's almost like, why would you bother?  But you know, microclimates and all that stuff.  And I've actually built my own data measurement kind of, I suppose you could call it an app.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:10):**  It's really a Google form that sits in a Google sites, which feeds a Google sheets and enables  me to, it enables, sorry, Google heard me talking to it and it's, it's my phone's lit  up.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:24):**  So apologies.  So the idea there is I can, we've got, I picked 14, I call them proof point sites around the  farm, the GPS location.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:32):**  And so with my phone, I can go to that GPS location.  My Google will tag the, tag the photo.  So I have to take a photo in the exact same direction from that proof point every time  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:42):**  I do it.  And again, Google will, I can tag those photos to that location really seamlessly.  I then open up my Google form that I made, which is a bit like a little app as you use  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:53):**  a mobile version.  And then I basically objectively assess about seven or eight different types of data in  that location.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:01):**  We have a penetrometer, which is like a big long kind of stick that you stick in the ground  and it tells you what kind of pressures you need to get X amount of depth.  We do some bricks reading.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:10):**  So that is the sugar content of the leafs, leaves of specific plants in the area, observations  of what weeds are growing.  Obviously it'll put a timestamp on it, water infiltration tests and a bunch of other things  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:22):**  that hopefully over time we'll start to see those proof points increase or decrease based  on whatever metric it is.  So I suppose from a startup perspective, there's some cheap and dirty hacks that we've kind  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:34):**  of just set up to get some data happening.  And then in time of course we'll bolt in more as we go.  But just to my final point is that all kind of sits in and behind the actual carbon baseline  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:44):**  that we've done, which is, you know, a one meter deep sample with two samples taken,  one at 30 centimeters and the next one, the next kind of 30 centimeters to one meter.  And that gives us a whole heap of information.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:56):**  And of course we'll be relying on that and that objective measurement on our farm over  time to see increases of soil health.  So I want to jump to the soil or the carbon stuff, but just before I do, the driver for  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:07):**  that app that you built, is that, was it for management decisions or was it for some kind  of reporting around some of the finance and reporting obligations that you guys might  have?  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:17):**  Actually, neither.  I mean, the production piece, it'll be interesting to use in both, but it's actually just more  for me to have data when maybe we do another podcast in five years and people say, oh,  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:30):**  I can't believe that you've done this, you've done that, or you've increased your carrying  capacity by 40%.  You know, what has gone into this?  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:37):**  And we can say, well, we've gotten rid of that hard pan that sits under our soil.  Our water infiltration now is sped up dramatically, which means, you know, so I'm actually just  building that data so I can talk to a whole bunch of information around, you know, where  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:51):**  we were and now where we are.  There are clearly some potential marketing benefits here as well for TazAgCo down the  line that Sam is looking to back up with evidence.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:01):**  But there are other motivations too, drivers that relate more to pride and passion.  There's also a part of me that's doing this because I actually want other farmers to be  empowered and excited about what we're doing and think, oh shit, maybe I can do that too.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:15):**  And I've been onto this farm in the Gippsland, just quickly, I'm digressing a bit, but I'm  getting my soil nerd, my inner nerd on now, but I walked onto this farm and we walked  into a paddock.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:28):**  It sent shivers up my spine.  It was like walking on a mattress, but it wasn't squishy, like wet.  It was the most amazing experience.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:36):**  And I've been reading about this stuff and you hear about it, but I've never ever seen  it.  And on this farm, the biology and the soil condition under our feet was just out of this  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:47):**  world.  And that's where I want to get to.  And if I can show people the trajectory that we've had to take and what we've had to do  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:54):**  to get to there, I think that'd be a great thing.  TazAgCo has been in the news recently a bit for some Tasmanian firsts in the carbon space.  They're the first soil carbon project in Tasmania to be registered under the ERF, the emissions  
**[0:17:12-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:12):**  reduction fund.  So the ERF is a billion dollar fund being set up by the government to buy and invest  in things and credits that allow Australia to reduce its overall targets that it's agreed  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:24):**  to under the Paris Agreement with the UN.  So it's pretty major.  In my mind and in my world, there are other soil carbon companies and other ways of testing  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:32):**  that you can do.  This is the only methodology that's been approved by the UN and it's the only methodology that's  accepted globally in being able to register soil credits at an international kind of level.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:45):**  And that for me again was if we're going to make some pretty big claims around carbon  and whatnot on our farm with our cattle, it's like, well, how can you make that claim?  What testing methodology have you used?  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:54):**  And I'm like, I've used the best in the world.  You cannot get any better soil testing carbon methodology than this.  And it was actually developed in Australia, which is cool too.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:03):**  So yeah, so we're the first to register a soil carbon project with the federal government,  which is huge.  And what I've heard is that process is pretty cumbersome to go through.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:15):**  Tell us about what you've had to do.  Yeah, so it's actually not so cumbersome for us.  And this is kind of full credit to AgriProve and Corporate Carbon, who have not only developed  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:25):**  this methodology alongside the federal government and took it to Paris, but have actually, they're  the ones implementing it and managing it across Australia and again, credit to them, they  kind of sat down with farmers that have had experience in the carbon space and they said,  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:38):**  what do you need?  What do you want?  It's kind of classic customer validation.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:42):**  And they said, it is one of the biggest minefields for legislative compliance and stuff.  So a lot of farmers in the early days almost had to become experts in environmental legislation  and whatnot to try and wade their way through the crap and red tape that sits around registering  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:59):**  soil carbon projects and whatnot.  So to be honest, AgriProve have taken a lot of that pain away from us.  We have a simple land management plan that we've got to set up and maintain.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:08):**  We've got to sign off on some things.  They've actually built an online platform that you can use to manage your whole project  online.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:14):**  So yeah, so to be honest, it actually has been very painless for us.  The actual soil testing on farm was horrific.  In actual fact, the guy that did it as a contractor said he's not going to ever do it again because  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:25):**  it drove him insane.  It's so cumbersome.  But again, that's just because it's got to be federally audited.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:31):**  It's a really rigorous, thorough process.  And so tell us what he actually had to do.  Just paint a picture of it.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:37):**  And it's expensive too, as I understand it, to get that done.  It's not too bad.  I can't remember the prices off the top of my head, unfortunately.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:44):**  I wish I could.  But I think it cost us about two, two and a half grand to do about 170 hectares.  So I suppose it's expensive if you start thinking, I've got 60,000 acres in Western Queensland.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:55):**  But if you're running the stocking capacity and you're running the output that we are,  it's not that big.  I think you can break even with a carbon project at 40 hectares, ideally, as you listeners  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:05):**  have got a bit of a benchmark.  But yes, so basically, they go down a metre and they pull a soil core out and that soil  core has to be intact, which is obviously pretty difficult.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:15):**  So sometimes we hit a rock halfway down, which means you had to move it.  If you move it, you've got to move it, I think three centimetres.  This is all fully with the GPS.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:23):**  The GPS has got, I think, one and a half centimetre accuracy.  And if there's a cow pat or a poo there, you've got to use a second site, which could be at  three or 400 metres away on farm.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:34):**  All the dig sites are randomly selected by a computer at random.  So you've got no control over where they are or what they're doing.  And yes, so we dig that.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:42):**  And then they had like a piece of what they call an angle iron, which is a 90 degree bit  of steel.  I suppose it must have been 70 by 70, but sitting in a V. And so the soil core didn't  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:52):**  get laid out in that V. So it sat in that.  And then like literally they had like dry paint brushes, like an archaeologist on that  geo.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:00):**  And they'd take the top 30 centimetres, they'd bag it and they'd barcode it.  And I'd take a photo of the barcode and they'd take a photo of the GPS.  And so everything was linked back to photos.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:12):**  And then they'd bag the bottom of this again, and they'd brush it off with the paint brush  in the packet to get every single little ounce of dirt in there.  And again, barcoded, photographed and everything was on this huge piece of paper, which had  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:24):**  every single coordinate and everything to do with everything.  And then that was all photographed as well.  So you had that back up and yeah, I mean, it took us a better part of seven hours, I  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:34):**  think, to do 18 digs.  And I think they're getting better and quicker at it now.  But yeah, it's pretty detailed.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:40):**  But it's got to stack up internationally when Australia stands up at the UN and says, this  is the breakdown of all the carbon credits that we bought, we bought at least soil carbon  credits, that's got to be internationally scrutinized.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:51):**  So you know, go to the paint brushes.  And so what do you expect to get from this?  Like, what were the drivers for you to register this project?  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:01):**  Financial versus branding versus good for the world?  What was, how did you think about it?  So most of it actually was marketing and branding, to be honest.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:10):**  It was that ability to stand by this data and say, look what we've done.  The next part of it would have been, I believe it's the right thing to do.  And if it's the right thing to do, I want to be able to prove to the world that we've  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:19):**  done this and what better to use in this particular methodology.  And I suppose the last point was that was the carbon credit value, was the money.  I mean, we might end up getting, I don't know, 13 to 16, 17 grand a year in carbon credits  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:35):**  from about year three or four, once the soil's kind of got itself sorted.  That's not to be sneezed at, that's not too bad, but it's like whatever.  The value that that testing and that validation will present to us in the market at a meat  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:49):**  and consumer levels far greater than 13 grand.  So as a self-proclaimed regenerative farmer, who is already seeing the benefits of the  marketing and branding using the term, what does Sam think of Regen Ag and any skeptics  
**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:05):**  out there?  Well, he's not afraid to tell you.  I suppose, you know me, I'm pretty opinionated and I have a lot of conviction to my beliefs.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:16):**  If you're speculative about regenerative agriculture, you probably need to get out from underneath  your rock and stop looking through the world through a keyhole and open your mind to be  completely upfront.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:26):**  I get very defensive of it.  There's guys out there in New Zealand, America, mainland Australia, running several thousand  acres.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:33):**  They've got input costs that are 20 or 30% of what they used to be and they're producing  as much, if not more food.  Their soils are incredible.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:41):**  Their water holding capacity is incredible and it really is the future.  I think we need to remember that this conventional system that we're using, it's actually only  about 70 years old.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:51):**  It was only created really kind of between and after World War One, World War Two.  And since then we've seen trillions of tonnes of carbon be released into the atmosphere  through tillage and the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:05):**  And the opportunity is to start restoring and fixing that.  And I just really hope people start to wake up because it's actually an enormous and exciting  amount of people that are a part of this journey.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:17):**  Everywhere I turn online, we're seeing more and more farmers pick it up and run with it.  Sam's view is that this movement and the way he talks about it does make it sound like  a movement will be led from the ground up, not by policymakers.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:32):**  And just quickly for any non-Australians out there, Sam mentions David Littleproud, who  is the current Minister for Agriculture.  You've got David Littleproud coming up the other day saying that he supports Roundup.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:44):**  I mean, Jesus, this is kind of where we're at.  This is the level of leadership that we have in our country.  So my point is this is not going to be a top down piece.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:52):**  This is a grassroots, ground up movement, a lot like AgTech, where you've got the people  on the ground actually doing the work and rising.  And then what we're starting to see now is consumers, and there are already top end retailers  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:05):**  in Melbourne and Sydney that have reached out to us because they want regenerative produce  in their stores.  So consumers are going to start to demand that produce is produced in a way that is  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:15):**  beneficial for the environment.  And you're going to have to prove it.  And farmers are going to have to start to service that market.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:21):**  And of course, there will be supply where there is demand.  And I would imagine in 15, 20 years, we'll hopefully start to see the majority start  to adopt practices that are turning their back on, I would say, a very destructive previous  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:34):**  70 years and are starting to kind of grasp the future.  And I would also like to make one more statement on this is a lot of these principles are actually  the old way of farming.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:46):**  Like they're not actually new.  Like it's actually the way we've been farming for tens of thousands of years.  The human civilization or its civilizations have evolved using these practices.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:57):**  And then of course, everything was industrialized and companies and agribusiness came into it.  And all of a sudden, we thought we could do it better.  And to give credit where credit is due, the conventional system has shown we can produce  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:07):**  an enormous amount of food, but it's also come at a cost.  And we're starting to see those costs in both planetary health, soil health, and also human  health.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:16):**  So anyway, it's going to be an interesting next decade in this space.  So if anyone's got a problem with that, feel free to give me a call.  Yeah, I would say I think it's more about the term that regenerative kind of implies  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:29):**  that there's a prescriptive system that you have to do to be a good farmer, as opposed  to following a set of principles around good farming practices that I think most, well,  I don't know about most, but lots of farmers would already be doing and identify with.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:43):**  But the term of kind of, this is good, this is bad, but it's vague and confusing and marketing  bullshit maybe is where the pushback comes, but it's also what consumers want.  So a bit of a double-edged sword, I guess.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:56):**  Yeah, it's kind of strange because I mean, the reality is, is the regenerative ag, true  regenerative agriculture, enterprise, farmer, whatever, it's actually a mindset shift.  And so yeah, you can rotationally graze your cattle.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:09):**  It doesn't, in my mind, really mean or stack up that you're a regenerative farmer, because  if you're still using like pesticides and herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and synthetic  first, you're still damaging soil.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:23):**  I don't care which way you look at it, the proof is there.  And if you're damaging soils, you're not putting carbon back in the ground, you're not enhancing  a lot of things that we need to be enhancing to increase quality and environmental benefits.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:36):**  So I suppose the good thing about the regenerative ag space is it's not like organics in it,  there's not a set prescriptive way that you have to farm or list of things that you can't  do.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:46):**  But on the same token, there's a lot of immaturity still in the region ag market where you've  got people claiming to be regenerative when they're still not really doing things that  I think most true regenerative farmers would support.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:57):**  So I think until we see a mindset change, and it's so simple as just stop killing stuff,  right, the whole conventional sector is set around killing stuff.  We spray weeds, we use synthetic fur, which kills off biology.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:11):**  So we need to stop killing stuff and just start working with Mother Nature a bit.  And I know again, this is where the conventional kind of right wing hard farmer starts to see  this is all a bit greeny, airy, fairy stuff as you start talking about working with Mother  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:25):**  Nature.  But that's the mindset shift that it actually requires because once you start working with  her, she does so much work for us and we just get out of the way and let her do her thing.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:35):**  And if I can just add something on there and just take weeds for example, right.  So Mother Nature loves diversity.  She go into any wild bush or jungle anywhere in the world and you'll see lots of plants  
**[0:28:45-0:28:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:45):**  all growing together.  And that's the way she likes it.  She does it on purpose because all those plants interact and work with each other in a different  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:52):**  way.  In industrial agriculture, of course, we create monocultures where we spray everything out  and we put just one or two species in.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:58):**  So weeds are being germinated because she's trying to create diversity.  That's what she's trying to do.  And once you start to understand what weeds are coming up and why they're coming up, then  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:08):**  all of a sudden we start to see a really exciting shift.  And if I can just use myself as an example, like I've got dock and scotch thistle in many  of our paddocks and the old way would be to go spray them.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:20):**  But I know too, if you spray them every year, they just keep on coming up.  So like what's the definition of insanity, right?  So and then as I sat back and I talked with some mentors and they're like, well, what  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:30):**  is it that dock and scotch thistle are doing?  Like what is it about those plants that ryegrass and clover don't have?  And it's like, well, they've both got huge tap roots and they both love pulling up P  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:40):**  and K, phosphorus and potassium from down low and making it available for plants that  don't have as deeper roots.  And so that's what their function is.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:49):**  That's what they're trying to do.  So what we then did is we went and put in multi-species mixes in those areas with tap  roots.  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:57):**  And what do you think is growing?  The oats that we put down are kind of, yeah, they're kind of going, but not really.  The tillage radish, the chicory, anything with a really big tap root, Mother Nature's  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:05):**  got behind and they're disproportionately growing at a bigger and faster rate than anything  with a shallow root base.  So it's kind of all of a sudden it's like you just need to get out of her way, put something  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:14):**  in her way.  And all of a sudden we're now growing huge amounts of cattle feed because cattle don't  like eating dock and scotch thistle in a way and doing obviously something to the soil  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:24):**  that she's been trying to do herself, but we keep on killing it and getting it away.  So again, I know it sounds a bit airy fairy, but that's kind of the mindset shift that  we're seeing in this space.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:33):**  And it's so exciting because all of a sudden you start saving money and producing as much  feed.  And I mean, you know, if that's not reason to jump in, what isn't?  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:41):**  I so appreciate how passionate and candid Sam is.  Regen Ag is a nuanced topic in what is already a really complex space.  And what I'm learning in this series is that there are many views out there, but not everyone  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:56):**  is willing to publicly share or stand behind theirs.  Another thing that people, whether farmers or entrepreneurs or both, struggle to talk  about is mistakes.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:07):**  The journey of starting any business is full of ups and downs.  And the key to succeeding, as Sam is finding with Taz Ag Co, is learning from the failures.  We'll close out this episode with Sam reflecting on the best and worst parts of the Taz Ag  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:23):**  Co journey so far.  We had the worst spring summer in 30 years and we've now had the best autumn apparently  in 50 years.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:31):**  So as my neighbors keep telling me, you've had a bit of a baptism of fire.  So yeah, we had a horrific run and then it's been an amazing autumn.  So it's been a pretty rough high and low journey from a seasonal point of view.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:43):**  I don't know.  It's a really good question from the business point of view.  It's kind of, I think we get, you know, you get so wrapped up in the weeds and I am so  
**[0:31:49-0:31:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:49):**  tough on myself.  You don't take the opportunity to sit back and go, wow, two and a half years ago, this  was an idea.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:56):**  We've now raised a number of million dollars to buy property, to invest in an operations  company.  We've got an employee, we've got all this stuff sitting around us, which has come from  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:06):**  hard work, grind, hustle and risk taking.  So that's a high, but I never really think of it like that because I'm just freaking  out and chewing like, you know what, to get stuff sorted.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:19):**  But you know, I think being with Steph and the family on the farm and being together  and not having that hustle and bustle city lifestyle where you're running out the house  at 6.37 o'clock and you don't get back until 6.37 o'clock.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:32):**  I think that's been a real high, it's just starting to pull back a bit and enjoy the  pace and Tassie's got a slower pace.  So I think that's been amazing.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:40):**  And then probably my biggest low has just been managing, we've had a few little glitches  here and there with animal health that any farmer has and it kind of has really gotten  me down.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:53):**  I've got to remember that I'm human and this is the first time that I've actually done  this.  And whilst I've been farming on and off my whole life, when it's yours and they're your  
**[0:32:59-0:33:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:59):**  animals it's all of a sudden it's very, very different.  So for me, that's probably my lowest point has been probably quite recently with this  really, really wet autumn, we've had some issues with worms and other bits and bobs  
**[0:33:12-0:33:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:12):**  that yeah, that's been pretty tough at a mental health level for me just dealing with that  stuff and enormous amount of pressure.  So yeah, but I mean, I think as dad said, you haven't buggered up until you repeat it.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:25):**  So if I get to this time next year and I'm whinging about the same thing, you'd have  to say I'm really not a very good manager.  So I really believe in the powers of observation and reflection and I'm always doing that.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:37):**  So I'm really, I believe as clear as I can be on how I've reacted and what it is that  I'm dealing with and therefore what I need to do to change, improve or maintain that  in the future.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:48):**  So yeah.  Love it Sam.  Thank you.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:52):**  Really good stuff.  Pleasure.  So that's a wrap on episode two in our Regen Ag series.

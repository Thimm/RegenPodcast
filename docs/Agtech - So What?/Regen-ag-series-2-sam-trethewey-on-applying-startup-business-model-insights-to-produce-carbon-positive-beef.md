### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 20:01:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome back to the Ag Tech So What podcast, brought to you by Agthentic.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:07):**  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:09):**  Today we are back with episode two in our series on regenerative agriculture or regen  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:14):**  ag.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:16):**  We had awesome feedback on our first episode featuring Mark Wooten of Jigsaw Farms, who  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:21):**  is you might say not a fan of the term regen ag.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:26):**  And today's guest has a very different view.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:30):**  Sam Chithui is an Australian farmer and entrepreneur who was actually on the podcast way back in  
**[0:00:36-0:00:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:36):**  episode seven.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:37):**  But we've invited him back to talk about his latest venture, Tasmanian Agriculture  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:42):**  Company, or the Taz Ag Co, where he's combining his knowledge of startups with his passion  
**[0:00:48-0:00:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:48):**  for farming to produce grass fed wagyu beef, all without actually owning any cows.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:00:55):**  Sam in this episode covers how Taz Ag Co got started, how the business model uses insights  
**[0:01:02-0:01:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:02):**  from his time in the ag tech world, what it's like to register a soil carbon project, his  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:08):**  views on regen ag, and his message for any regen ag skeptics out there.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:14):**  Sam starts with an overview of what they're up to at Taz Ag Co.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:20):**  So we run a company called the Tasmanian Agricultural Company, and we do a beyond sustainable beef  
**[0:01:25-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:25):**  product.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:26):**  It's essentially a grass fed wagyu animal.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:28):**  We farm in a regenerative way.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:29):**  And I mean, we can talk about this too, regenerative is a fairly loose term and you know what it  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:33):**  actually means to certain people and produces kind of varies.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:37):**  But for us, it means that we follow a fairly regimented time controlled grazing system,  
**[0:01:42-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:42):**  or cell grazing is more commonly known.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:44):**  We also use a lot of multi species crops across our farm.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:47):**  And we also moved away from insecticides, fungicides, most herbicides and all synthetic  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:54):**  fertilizer.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:01:55):**  We'll come back to more of Sam's views on regen ag, but I wanted to jump to how they  
**[0:02:00-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:00):**  got started.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:02):**  Just a couple of years ago, Sam was working in the startup world as general manager and  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:07):**  co founder of SproutX, Australia's first ag tech accelerator.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:12):**  But even at that time, he was feeling the pull to start something himself.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:17):**  I suppose I just miss production.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:19):**  I miss being on farm, I miss the outdoors.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:22):**  And I mean, some people say it's your blood or whatever.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:25):**  But first and foremost, I wanted to do something that was mine or that was ours in our family  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:29):**  unit and build something on the sake of making everyone else money.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:34):**  And for me personally, just connecting back with nature was a really big thing.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:39):**  Sam and his wife, Steph started with the demand side, as in the consumer from the very beginning.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:45):**  Steph, my wife, when we were planning this business said, well, what's after grass fed?  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:49):**  Like what's the next thing?  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:51):**  And for us, it was carbon positive beef or beef that's produced in a way that actually  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:55):**  heals and encourages the environment to do what it's supposed to do.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:02:59):**  So yeah, that's kind of where it all came about.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:02):**  And I mean, we're actually processing our first animal this weekend as a trial and a  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:05):**  test, which is kind of grim when you pick the first one out.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:08):**  But that's I suppose what we're here to do.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:11):**  And yeah, it's gonna be really exciting to see kind of this time next week, we would  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:14):**  have tasted our first product, which is going to be pretty intense.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:18):**  It'll be two and a half years of work.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:20):**  What are you testing for?  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:22):**  Tenderness.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:23):**  So yeah, no eating quality, really, and to see how the marbling is going.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:29):**  I checked in with Sam as I was pulling together this episode, and he said the test went well,  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:34):**  which is important as they've changed things up at Taz Ag Co in quite a few ways, borrowing  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:39):**  insights about business models and finance from the startup world and applying them to  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:44):**  agriculture.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:45):**  Our business is, I would argue, is quite innovative in most of the ways in which we operate.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:50):**  So the way we're structured, the way we raised our capital, the way we have structured  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:54):**  our operations company and our property company, our prop co and op co.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:03:58):**  And I suppose into that point, the way we produce, having watched the startups be very  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:02):**  effective at getting big heavy things off their balance sheet, because therefore, if  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:06):**  you've got heavy things on your balance sheet, you've got to raise more money and therefore  
**[0:04:09-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:09):**  give away more equity, right?  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:11):**  And I hate to use these cliched examples of air, B&B and Uber, but you've got the biggest  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:16):**  transport company in the world doesn't own a car, that whole thing.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:19):**  How can we be a big beef producer and not own a cow?  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:22):**  So we actually put out our high growth waggies into dairies.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:26):**  They don't want half their calf drop.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:28):**  They actually kill them under a week old.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:31):**  And so they've got an animal welfare issue.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:33):**  And we therefore pivot a waste product into a high value product.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:36):**  And we essentially breed cattle without owning cows.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:39):**  So that's been a really cool part of our business.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:42):**  And one of the things I probably underestimated, you know, they'd say keep it simple, stupid  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:46):**  and all that stuff.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:47):**  But it's actually become a very complex, difficult kind of production model that we've had to  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:51):**  kind of really clamp down on if we're to produce a consistent quality kind of premium beef  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:56):**  product.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:04:57):**  There are a couple of key things on the finance side that had to come together to get this  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:01):**  model to work.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:02):**  And again, Sam has drawn on business examples from outside of agriculture for inspiration.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:08):**  The PropCo is my wife and I, the Tasmanian government have got an amazing loan for new  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:13):**  or young farmers at an interest rate that's better than I can get off family.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:18):**  So we've got that set up with the TassieGov.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:21):**  We then went and raised equity capital for the actual operations company.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:25):**  And I suppose if you think about it, a farming business is actually not worth anything as  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:28):**  a business.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:29):**  It's a bunch of capital and human capital that have been put together to produce a commodity.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:33):**  The actual underlying business, unlike a takeaway shop on the corner, you can put a valuation  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:39):**  on a takeaway shop or a startup as hard as that may be.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:42):**  But a farming business isn't actually worth anything.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:45):**  And so I suppose if we're getting an investor into a beef business, that's where the marketing  
**[0:05:50-0:05:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:50):**  piece comes in.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:51):**  So the value of our business actually sits in the brand and as a marketing house and  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:05:56):**  big fan of brands and so have kind of built our future plans around a virgin type kind  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:02):**  of model when we're kind of trying to lift the value of that intangible brand.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:07):**  Sam is referring to Richard Branson and The Virgin Group, a multinational conglomerate  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:12):**  famous for its complex structure, sometimes called the House of Brands.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:16):**  Back to Sam and a few more areas of the business model where they've shaken things up.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:21):**  The way we finance the calves is quite innovative too.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:23):**  So again, I suppose you've got to remember, Steph and I don't have a lot of equity really  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:28):**  at all and we had to kind of create this from nothing.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:30):**  So we went to a known debt provider in the livestock world and their interest rates were  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:37):**  like double digits, which is pretty crazy given the cash rate.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:42):**  So we went to the private debt market through family, friends and other contacts.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:46):**  Again learned all this stuff through my time in VC and in Ag Tech and yeah, basically raised  
**[0:06:51-0:06:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:51):**  debt capital.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:52):**  I think we're paying about 8% at the moment and therefore we can buy the calves with that  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:06:56):**  debt and then the calf will be processed as a yearling at 18 to 20 months old.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:03):**  At that point, that's when we pay back the principal and the interest.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:07):**  So that means that from a cashflow point of view, we don't have to pay regular interest  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:11):**  payments.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:12):**  We do it at the end in a big lump sum and so it's in a cost of ownership of around $70  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:17):**  a head, which is pretty palatable.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:20):**  So that's quite innovative.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:21):**  Then the way we're structuring our future lease payments too, it looks like as an early  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:26):**  starting position, we're working with some investors where we actually pay leased on  
**[0:07:30-0:07:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:30):**  the farm's ability to produce feed.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:33):**  So it'll be much like a lease that I've seen in the McDonald's business.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:36):**  So McDonald's franchisees pay lease to McDonald's corporation based on a percentage of their  
**[0:07:41-0:07:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:41):**  gross sales for the month.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:43):**  So they have a floating rent payment and so we're going to be doing that on the land,  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:46):**  which is exciting.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:47):**  We have poorer rainfall and even a drought and therefore our productivity is low.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:51):**  We don't pay as much rent, which is perfect.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:54):**  But then of course, happy to share the upside in a really good season.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:07:56):**  So we're just being really innovative in every which way we can.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:00):**  Is that related to the season or how does that tie in with management practice?  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:05):**  Like if you're doing better by the land and natural capital, whether it's storing carbon,  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:11):**  better coverage, et cetera, do you get rewarded for that in some way?  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:17):**  Or is that just through yield and over time resilience?  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:20):**  Yeah, no, it's a great question.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:22):**  And that's where actually I've got a meeting in an hour and a half to nut more of this  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:26):**  out because if you did it just on the farm's ability to produce feed, there are lots of  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:30):**  variables that can come into that.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:32):**  So we are looking at a way, an output figure, which is a result of increasing soil health  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:37):**  along with the fact that figures probably marked to rainfall.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:41):**  So we might have an increase in soil health and soil carbon over time, which increases  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:45):**  water holding capacity and nutrient density, but have a below average rainfall year, but  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:51):**  we still maintain healthy carrying capacity on that property.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:08:55):**  So what it's looking like is it'll be linked to animal days per hectare, per hundred mill  
**[0:09:00-0:09:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:00):**  of rain or something along those lines.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:02):**  Are you able to do that and even consider that because it's outside of the traditional  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:07):**  kind of bank and livestock finance?  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:10):**  Is that just private agreements that you guys will be able to get up with people who believe  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:13):**  in this kind of thing?  
**[0:09:15-0:09:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:15):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:16):**  So the kind of investors we're working with are generally kind of regeneratively focused  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:20):**  and want to see farming change.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:23):**  And more excitingly, they want to be a part of that story.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:26):**  They want to be a part of our story.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:28):**  And they are really excited about our background in our team, which I suppose talks to your  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:33):**  world a lot.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:34):**  You know, you invest in the team.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:36):**  Beyond some of the feel good aspects of Regen Ag that are so often sold, Sam has focused  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:43):**  on building an evidence base to back up different claims.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:47):**  For us, with my Ag Tech background, it is about building data.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:50):**  The issue with regenerative agriculture is there's not enough data.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:54):**  So if you're a US pension fund and you want to invest in, you know, you want to chuck  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:09:58):**  a billion US dollars into Australian agriculture, which there's one or two have, you're only  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:03):**  going to put it into a conventional agricultural system, whether that's in wheat, walnuts,  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:08):**  dairy, beef, because there's the data.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:11):**  There's 60, 70 years of production data and performance data that you know you're going  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:16):**  to get your return.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:17):**  There's obviously no assessment done on the environmental cost of that return.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:21):**  And that's where we're starting to see some people say, well, we'd like to invest in a  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:24):**  different type of farming, but you can't show me five to 10 or three years of evidence that  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:30):**  suggests that you can produce as much food or more, or at least commit to a return on  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:36):**  investment.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:37):**  So that for me is our kind of part of our end game and our scalability plans.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:43):**  So Sam has gone outside of the traditional finance world to get what we might call true  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:48):**  believers on board.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:50):**  Those first investors who believe in something before it even exists.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:54):**  But like for most startups, raising money is not easy.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:10:58):**  I suppose like a lot of things, it has been a slog.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:02):**  But it's funny once you get a few runs on the board and you're in the paper and online  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:08):**  and all of a sudden people start to notice and you then attract like minded people who  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:13):**  and all of a sudden, I wouldn't say things are snowballing quite so much yet, but they're  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:19):**  moving without a lot of pushing, I suppose is the best way to put it.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:22):**  But yeah, to be honest, Sarah, I mean, the first, I mean, my capital raising, I mean,  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:27):**  I did it with SproutX and they've done it with other projects.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:29):**  This is obviously very different.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:31):**  And yeah, the capital raising piece for Tazaco is one of the worst experiences of my professional  
**[0:11:36-0:11:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:36):**  life.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:37):**  I used to watch the startups do it and it's just such a grueling process and you've just  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:42):**  got to get used to hearing no and used to, you know, you've got to kiss a lot of frogs.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:48):**  And so yeah, I don't want to do that again anytime soon.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:50):**  And hopefully I'll get my career to a point where I can prove my worth through projects  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:54):**  and traction that people will come to me and say, Hey, I've got 5 million bucks.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:11:58):**  I think we should do something together.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:00):**  What do you reckon?  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:01):**  Yeah, that's always the goal.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:02):**  Just get people throwing money at you.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:04):**  I want to go back to the data piece.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:06):**  How do you guys, how are you guys doing that from a kind of tech or data perspective?  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:11):**  Is it, is it different tools, spreadsheets, off the shelf stuff, custom stuff?  
**[0:12:15-0:12:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:15):**  How have you thought about building that base of evidence?  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:18):**  Our main farm management platform is actually my grazing.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:22):**  So that enables actually what we were talking about earlier.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:24):**  It enables me to calculate those stock days per hectare per hundred millire and all that  
**[0:12:28-0:12:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:28):**  stuff.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:29):**  And that's the main farm management piece that we're using, which will over time show  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:33):**  where we were at from a stocking capacity and where we can go.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:36):**  So it actually kind of does a lot of what we need something to do.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:40):**  I'm actually just saving up or trying to find some ways to invest in some into some better  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:44):**  weather technology monitoring and look, it's only a couple of gram, but it's, you know,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:49):**  being a startup, it's another, another two or three grand that I've got to find and justify.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:53):**  So, and we've also got a, we're quite lucky.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:55):**  We've got a Bureau of Meteorology, rainfall weather station about a kilometer away.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:12:59):**  So it's almost like, why would you bother?  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:01):**  But you know, microclimates and all that stuff.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:05):**  And I've actually built my own data measurement kind of, I suppose you could call it an app.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:10):**  It's really a Google form that sits in a Google sites, which feeds a Google sheets and enables  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:17):**  me to, it enables, sorry, Google heard me talking to it and it's, it's my phone's lit  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:23):**  up.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:24):**  So apologies.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:25):**  So the idea there is I can, we've got, I picked 14, I call them proof point sites around the  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:29):**  farm, the GPS location.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:32):**  And so with my phone, I can go to that GPS location.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:35):**  My Google will tag the, tag the photo.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:38):**  So I have to take a photo in the exact same direction from that proof point every time  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:42):**  I do it.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:43):**  And again, Google will, I can tag those photos to that location really seamlessly.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:48):**  I then open up my Google form that I made, which is a bit like a little app as you use  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:53):**  a mobile version.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:54):**  And then I basically objectively assess about seven or eight different types of data in  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:13:59):**  that location.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:01):**  We have a penetrometer, which is like a big long kind of stick that you stick in the ground  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:04):**  and it tells you what kind of pressures you need to get X amount of depth.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:08):**  We do some bricks reading.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:10):**  So that is the sugar content of the leafs, leaves of specific plants in the area, observations  
**[0:14:15-0:14:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:15):**  of what weeds are growing.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:16):**  Obviously it'll put a timestamp on it, water infiltration tests and a bunch of other things  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:22):**  that hopefully over time we'll start to see those proof points increase or decrease based  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:27):**  on whatever metric it is.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:30):**  So I suppose from a startup perspective, there's some cheap and dirty hacks that we've kind  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:34):**  of just set up to get some data happening.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:37):**  And then in time of course we'll bolt in more as we go.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:40):**  But just to my final point is that all kind of sits in and behind the actual carbon baseline  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:44):**  that we've done, which is, you know, a one meter deep sample with two samples taken,  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:49):**  one at 30 centimeters and the next one, the next kind of 30 centimeters to one meter.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:54):**  And that gives us a whole heap of information.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:14:56):**  And of course we'll be relying on that and that objective measurement on our farm over  
**[0:15:00-0:15:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:00):**  time to see increases of soil health.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:03):**  So I want to jump to the soil or the carbon stuff, but just before I do, the driver for  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:07):**  that app that you built, is that, was it for management decisions or was it for some kind  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:12):**  of reporting around some of the finance and reporting obligations that you guys might  
**[0:15:16-0:15:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:16):**  have?  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:17):**  Actually, neither.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:18):**  I mean, the production piece, it'll be interesting to use in both, but it's actually just more  
**[0:15:23-0:15:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:23):**  for me to have data when maybe we do another podcast in five years and people say, oh,  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:30):**  I can't believe that you've done this, you've done that, or you've increased your carrying  
**[0:15:34-0:15:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:34):**  capacity by 40%.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:35):**  You know, what has gone into this?  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:37):**  And we can say, well, we've gotten rid of that hard pan that sits under our soil.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:41):**  Our water infiltration now is sped up dramatically, which means, you know, so I'm actually just  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:46):**  building that data so I can talk to a whole bunch of information around, you know, where  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:51):**  we were and now where we are.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:54):**  There are clearly some potential marketing benefits here as well for TazAgCo down the  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:15:58):**  line that Sam is looking to back up with evidence.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:01):**  But there are other motivations too, drivers that relate more to pride and passion.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:07):**  There's also a part of me that's doing this because I actually want other farmers to be  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:10):**  empowered and excited about what we're doing and think, oh shit, maybe I can do that too.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:15):**  And I've been onto this farm in the Gippsland, just quickly, I'm digressing a bit, but I'm  
**[0:16:20-0:16:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:20):**  getting my soil nerd, my inner nerd on now, but I walked onto this farm and we walked  
**[0:16:27-0:16:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:27):**  into a paddock.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:28):**  It sent shivers up my spine.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:30):**  It was like walking on a mattress, but it wasn't squishy, like wet.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:34):**  It was the most amazing experience.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:36):**  And I've been reading about this stuff and you hear about it, but I've never ever seen  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:40):**  it.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:41):**  And on this farm, the biology and the soil condition under our feet was just out of this  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:47):**  world.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:48):**  And that's where I want to get to.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:49):**  And if I can show people the trajectory that we've had to take and what we've had to do  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:16:54):**  to get to there, I think that'd be a great thing.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:00):**  TazAgCo has been in the news recently a bit for some Tasmanian firsts in the carbon space.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:06):**  They're the first soil carbon project in Tasmania to be registered under the ERF, the emissions  
**[0:17:12-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:12):**  reduction fund.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:13):**  So the ERF is a billion dollar fund being set up by the government to buy and invest  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:18):**  in things and credits that allow Australia to reduce its overall targets that it's agreed  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:24):**  to under the Paris Agreement with the UN.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:26):**  So it's pretty major.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:28):**  In my mind and in my world, there are other soil carbon companies and other ways of testing  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:32):**  that you can do.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:33):**  This is the only methodology that's been approved by the UN and it's the only methodology that's  
**[0:17:38-0:17:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:38):**  accepted globally in being able to register soil credits at an international kind of level.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:45):**  And that for me again was if we're going to make some pretty big claims around carbon  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:49):**  and whatnot on our farm with our cattle, it's like, well, how can you make that claim?  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:53):**  What testing methodology have you used?  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:54):**  And I'm like, I've used the best in the world.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:17:56):**  You cannot get any better soil testing carbon methodology than this.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:00):**  And it was actually developed in Australia, which is cool too.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:03):**  So yeah, so we're the first to register a soil carbon project with the federal government,  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:07):**  which is huge.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:09):**  And what I've heard is that process is pretty cumbersome to go through.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:15):**  Tell us about what you've had to do.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:17):**  Yeah, so it's actually not so cumbersome for us.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:21):**  And this is kind of full credit to AgriProve and Corporate Carbon, who have not only developed  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:25):**  this methodology alongside the federal government and took it to Paris, but have actually, they're  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:30):**  the ones implementing it and managing it across Australia and again, credit to them, they  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:35):**  kind of sat down with farmers that have had experience in the carbon space and they said,  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:38):**  what do you need?  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:39):**  What do you want?  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:40):**  It's kind of classic customer validation.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:42):**  And they said, it is one of the biggest minefields for legislative compliance and stuff.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:49):**  So a lot of farmers in the early days almost had to become experts in environmental legislation  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:54):**  and whatnot to try and wade their way through the crap and red tape that sits around registering  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:18:59):**  soil carbon projects and whatnot.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:01):**  So to be honest, AgriProve have taken a lot of that pain away from us.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:05):**  We have a simple land management plan that we've got to set up and maintain.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:08):**  We've got to sign off on some things.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:09):**  They've actually built an online platform that you can use to manage your whole project  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:13):**  online.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:14):**  So yeah, so to be honest, it actually has been very painless for us.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:17):**  The actual soil testing on farm was horrific.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:20):**  In actual fact, the guy that did it as a contractor said he's not going to ever do it again because  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:25):**  it drove him insane.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:27):**  It's so cumbersome.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:28):**  But again, that's just because it's got to be federally audited.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:31):**  It's a really rigorous, thorough process.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:34):**  And so tell us what he actually had to do.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:36):**  Just paint a picture of it.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:37):**  And it's expensive too, as I understand it, to get that done.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:40):**  It's not too bad.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:41):**  I can't remember the prices off the top of my head, unfortunately.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:44):**  I wish I could.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:45):**  But I think it cost us about two, two and a half grand to do about 170 hectares.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:50):**  So I suppose it's expensive if you start thinking, I've got 60,000 acres in Western Queensland.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:55):**  But if you're running the stocking capacity and you're running the output that we are,  
**[0:19:59-0:20:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:19:59):**  it's not that big.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:00):**  I think you can break even with a carbon project at 40 hectares, ideally, as you listeners  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:05):**  have got a bit of a benchmark.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:06):**  But yes, so basically, they go down a metre and they pull a soil core out and that soil  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:11):**  core has to be intact, which is obviously pretty difficult.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:15):**  So sometimes we hit a rock halfway down, which means you had to move it.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:18):**  If you move it, you've got to move it, I think three centimetres.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:21):**  This is all fully with the GPS.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:23):**  The GPS has got, I think, one and a half centimetre accuracy.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:27):**  And if there's a cow pat or a poo there, you've got to use a second site, which could be at  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:32):**  three or 400 metres away on farm.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:34):**  All the dig sites are randomly selected by a computer at random.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:38):**  So you've got no control over where they are or what they're doing.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:41):**  And yes, so we dig that.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:42):**  And then they had like a piece of what they call an angle iron, which is a 90 degree bit  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:46):**  of steel.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:47):**  I suppose it must have been 70 by 70, but sitting in a V. And so the soil core didn't  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:52):**  get laid out in that V. So it sat in that.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:55):**  And then like literally they had like dry paint brushes, like an archaeologist on that  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:20:59):**  geo.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:00):**  And they'd take the top 30 centimetres, they'd bag it and they'd barcode it.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:05):**  And I'd take a photo of the barcode and they'd take a photo of the GPS.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:09):**  And so everything was linked back to photos.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:12):**  And then they'd bag the bottom of this again, and they'd brush it off with the paint brush  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:16):**  in the packet to get every single little ounce of dirt in there.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:20):**  And again, barcoded, photographed and everything was on this huge piece of paper, which had  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:24):**  every single coordinate and everything to do with everything.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:27):**  And then that was all photographed as well.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:29):**  So you had that back up and yeah, I mean, it took us a better part of seven hours, I  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:34):**  think, to do 18 digs.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:35):**  And I think they're getting better and quicker at it now.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:38):**  But yeah, it's pretty detailed.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:40):**  But it's got to stack up internationally when Australia stands up at the UN and says, this  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:46):**  is the breakdown of all the carbon credits that we bought, we bought at least soil carbon  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:49):**  credits, that's got to be internationally scrutinized.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:51):**  So you know, go to the paint brushes.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:55):**  And so what do you expect to get from this?  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:21:58):**  Like, what were the drivers for you to register this project?  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:01):**  Financial versus branding versus good for the world?  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:05):**  What was, how did you think about it?  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:07):**  So most of it actually was marketing and branding, to be honest.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:10):**  It was that ability to stand by this data and say, look what we've done.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:13):**  The next part of it would have been, I believe it's the right thing to do.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:16):**  And if it's the right thing to do, I want to be able to prove to the world that we've  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:19):**  done this and what better to use in this particular methodology.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:23):**  And I suppose the last point was that was the carbon credit value, was the money.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:27):**  I mean, we might end up getting, I don't know, 13 to 16, 17 grand a year in carbon credits  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:35):**  from about year three or four, once the soil's kind of got itself sorted.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:39):**  That's not to be sneezed at, that's not too bad, but it's like whatever.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:43):**  The value that that testing and that validation will present to us in the market at a meat  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:49):**  and consumer levels far greater than 13 grand.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:54):**  So as a self-proclaimed regenerative farmer, who is already seeing the benefits of the  
**[0:22:59-0:23:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:22:59):**  marketing and branding using the term, what does Sam think of Regen Ag and any skeptics  
**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:05):**  out there?  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:06):**  Well, he's not afraid to tell you.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:09):**  I suppose, you know me, I'm pretty opinionated and I have a lot of conviction to my beliefs.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:16):**  If you're speculative about regenerative agriculture, you probably need to get out from underneath  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:20):**  your rock and stop looking through the world through a keyhole and open your mind to be  
**[0:23:25-0:23:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:25):**  completely upfront.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:26):**  I get very defensive of it.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:28):**  There's guys out there in New Zealand, America, mainland Australia, running several thousand  
**[0:23:32-0:23:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:32):**  acres.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:33):**  They've got input costs that are 20 or 30% of what they used to be and they're producing  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:38):**  as much, if not more food.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:39):**  Their soils are incredible.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:41):**  Their water holding capacity is incredible and it really is the future.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:45):**  I think we need to remember that this conventional system that we're using, it's actually only  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:49):**  about 70 years old.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:51):**  It was only created really kind of between and after World War One, World War Two.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:55):**  And since then we've seen trillions of tonnes of carbon be released into the atmosphere  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:23:59):**  through tillage and the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:05):**  And the opportunity is to start restoring and fixing that.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:08):**  And I just really hope people start to wake up because it's actually an enormous and exciting  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:14):**  amount of people that are a part of this journey.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:17):**  Everywhere I turn online, we're seeing more and more farmers pick it up and run with it.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:23):**  Sam's view is that this movement and the way he talks about it does make it sound like  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:27):**  a movement will be led from the ground up, not by policymakers.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:32):**  And just quickly for any non-Australians out there, Sam mentions David Littleproud, who  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:37):**  is the current Minister for Agriculture.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:40):**  You've got David Littleproud coming up the other day saying that he supports Roundup.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:44):**  I mean, Jesus, this is kind of where we're at.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:47):**  This is the level of leadership that we have in our country.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:49):**  So my point is this is not going to be a top down piece.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:52):**  This is a grassroots, ground up movement, a lot like AgTech, where you've got the people  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:24:57):**  on the ground actually doing the work and rising.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:00):**  And then what we're starting to see now is consumers, and there are already top end retailers  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:05):**  in Melbourne and Sydney that have reached out to us because they want regenerative produce  
**[0:25:09-0:25:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:09):**  in their stores.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:10):**  So consumers are going to start to demand that produce is produced in a way that is  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:15):**  beneficial for the environment.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:17):**  And you're going to have to prove it.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:18):**  And farmers are going to have to start to service that market.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:21):**  And of course, there will be supply where there is demand.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:25):**  And I would imagine in 15, 20 years, we'll hopefully start to see the majority start  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:29):**  to adopt practices that are turning their back on, I would say, a very destructive previous  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:34):**  70 years and are starting to kind of grasp the future.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:38):**  And I would also like to make one more statement on this is a lot of these principles are actually  
**[0:25:44-0:25:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:44):**  the old way of farming.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:46):**  Like they're not actually new.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:47):**  Like it's actually the way we've been farming for tens of thousands of years.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:50):**  The human civilization or its civilizations have evolved using these practices.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:25:57):**  And then of course, everything was industrialized and companies and agribusiness came into it.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:01):**  And all of a sudden, we thought we could do it better.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:03):**  And to give credit where credit is due, the conventional system has shown we can produce  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:07):**  an enormous amount of food, but it's also come at a cost.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:11):**  And we're starting to see those costs in both planetary health, soil health, and also human  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:15):**  health.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:16):**  So anyway, it's going to be an interesting next decade in this space.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:20):**  So if anyone's got a problem with that, feel free to give me a call.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:23):**  Yeah, I would say I think it's more about the term that regenerative kind of implies  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:29):**  that there's a prescriptive system that you have to do to be a good farmer, as opposed  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:34):**  to following a set of principles around good farming practices that I think most, well,  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:40):**  I don't know about most, but lots of farmers would already be doing and identify with.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:43):**  But the term of kind of, this is good, this is bad, but it's vague and confusing and marketing  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:49):**  bullshit maybe is where the pushback comes, but it's also what consumers want.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:54):**  So a bit of a double-edged sword, I guess.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:26:56):**  Yeah, it's kind of strange because I mean, the reality is, is the regenerative ag, true  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:00):**  regenerative agriculture, enterprise, farmer, whatever, it's actually a mindset shift.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:07):**  And so yeah, you can rotationally graze your cattle.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:09):**  It doesn't, in my mind, really mean or stack up that you're a regenerative farmer, because  
**[0:27:14-0:27:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:14):**  if you're still using like pesticides and herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and synthetic  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:21):**  first, you're still damaging soil.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:23):**  I don't care which way you look at it, the proof is there.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:28):**  And if you're damaging soils, you're not putting carbon back in the ground, you're not enhancing  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:32):**  a lot of things that we need to be enhancing to increase quality and environmental benefits.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:36):**  So I suppose the good thing about the regenerative ag space is it's not like organics in it,  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:41):**  there's not a set prescriptive way that you have to farm or list of things that you can't  
**[0:27:45-0:27:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:45):**  do.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:46):**  But on the same token, there's a lot of immaturity still in the region ag market where you've  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:50):**  got people claiming to be regenerative when they're still not really doing things that  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:54):**  I think most true regenerative farmers would support.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:27:57):**  So I think until we see a mindset change, and it's so simple as just stop killing stuff,  
**[0:28:03-0:28:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:03):**  right, the whole conventional sector is set around killing stuff.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:06):**  We spray weeds, we use synthetic fur, which kills off biology.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:11):**  So we need to stop killing stuff and just start working with Mother Nature a bit.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:15):**  And I know again, this is where the conventional kind of right wing hard farmer starts to see  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:21):**  this is all a bit greeny, airy, fairy stuff as you start talking about working with Mother  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:25):**  Nature.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:26):**  But that's the mindset shift that it actually requires because once you start working with  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:30):**  her, she does so much work for us and we just get out of the way and let her do her thing.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:35):**  And if I can just add something on there and just take weeds for example, right.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:38):**  So Mother Nature loves diversity.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:41):**  She go into any wild bush or jungle anywhere in the world and you'll see lots of plants  
**[0:28:45-0:28:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:45):**  all growing together.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:46):**  And that's the way she likes it.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:47):**  She does it on purpose because all those plants interact and work with each other in a different  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:52):**  way.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:53):**  In industrial agriculture, of course, we create monocultures where we spray everything out  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:56):**  and we put just one or two species in.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:28:58):**  So weeds are being germinated because she's trying to create diversity.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:02):**  That's what she's trying to do.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:03):**  And once you start to understand what weeds are coming up and why they're coming up, then  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:08):**  all of a sudden we start to see a really exciting shift.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:11):**  And if I can just use myself as an example, like I've got dock and scotch thistle in many  
**[0:29:17-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:17):**  of our paddocks and the old way would be to go spray them.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:20):**  But I know too, if you spray them every year, they just keep on coming up.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:23):**  So like what's the definition of insanity, right?  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:26):**  So and then as I sat back and I talked with some mentors and they're like, well, what  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:30):**  is it that dock and scotch thistle are doing?  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:32):**  Like what is it about those plants that ryegrass and clover don't have?  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:36):**  And it's like, well, they've both got huge tap roots and they both love pulling up P  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:40):**  and K, phosphorus and potassium from down low and making it available for plants that  
**[0:29:45-0:29:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:45):**  don't have as deeper roots.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:47):**  And so that's what their function is.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:49):**  That's what they're trying to do.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:50):**  So what we then did is we went and put in multi-species mixes in those areas with tap  
**[0:29:56-0:29:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:56):**  roots.  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:57):**  And what do you think is growing?  
**[0:29:58-0:30:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:29:58):**  The oats that we put down are kind of, yeah, they're kind of going, but not really.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:01):**  The tillage radish, the chicory, anything with a really big tap root, Mother Nature's  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:05):**  got behind and they're disproportionately growing at a bigger and faster rate than anything  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:09):**  with a shallow root base.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:10):**  So it's kind of all of a sudden it's like you just need to get out of her way, put something  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:14):**  in her way.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:15):**  And all of a sudden we're now growing huge amounts of cattle feed because cattle don't  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:19):**  like eating dock and scotch thistle in a way and doing obviously something to the soil  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:24):**  that she's been trying to do herself, but we keep on killing it and getting it away.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:28):**  So again, I know it sounds a bit airy fairy, but that's kind of the mindset shift that  
**[0:30:32-0:30:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:32):**  we're seeing in this space.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:33):**  And it's so exciting because all of a sudden you start saving money and producing as much  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:37):**  feed.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:38):**  And I mean, you know, if that's not reason to jump in, what isn't?  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:41):**  I so appreciate how passionate and candid Sam is.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:46):**  Regen Ag is a nuanced topic in what is already a really complex space.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:51):**  And what I'm learning in this series is that there are many views out there, but not everyone  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:30:56):**  is willing to publicly share or stand behind theirs.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:01):**  Another thing that people, whether farmers or entrepreneurs or both, struggle to talk  
**[0:31:05-0:31:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:05):**  about is mistakes.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:07):**  The journey of starting any business is full of ups and downs.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:11):**  And the key to succeeding, as Sam is finding with Taz Ag Co, is learning from the failures.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:17):**  We'll close out this episode with Sam reflecting on the best and worst parts of the Taz Ag  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:23):**  Co journey so far.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:25):**  We had the worst spring summer in 30 years and we've now had the best autumn apparently  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:29):**  in 50 years.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:31):**  So as my neighbors keep telling me, you've had a bit of a baptism of fire.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:34):**  So yeah, we had a horrific run and then it's been an amazing autumn.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:39):**  So it's been a pretty rough high and low journey from a seasonal point of view.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:43):**  I don't know.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:44):**  It's a really good question from the business point of view.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:46):**  It's kind of, I think we get, you know, you get so wrapped up in the weeds and I am so  
**[0:31:49-0:31:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:49):**  tough on myself.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:51):**  You don't take the opportunity to sit back and go, wow, two and a half years ago, this  
**[0:31:55-0:31:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:55):**  was an idea.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:31:56):**  We've now raised a number of million dollars to buy property, to invest in an operations  
**[0:32:01-0:32:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:01):**  company.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:02):**  We've got an employee, we've got all this stuff sitting around us, which has come from  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:06):**  hard work, grind, hustle and risk taking.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:10):**  So that's a high, but I never really think of it like that because I'm just freaking  
**[0:32:13-0:32:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:13):**  out and chewing like, you know what, to get stuff sorted.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:19):**  But you know, I think being with Steph and the family on the farm and being together  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:22):**  and not having that hustle and bustle city lifestyle where you're running out the house  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:27):**  at 6.37 o'clock and you don't get back until 6.37 o'clock.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:32):**  I think that's been a real high, it's just starting to pull back a bit and enjoy the  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:36):**  pace and Tassie's got a slower pace.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:38):**  So I think that's been amazing.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:40):**  And then probably my biggest low has just been managing, we've had a few little glitches  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:48):**  here and there with animal health that any farmer has and it kind of has really gotten  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:52):**  me down.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:53):**  I've got to remember that I'm human and this is the first time that I've actually done  
**[0:32:55-0:32:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:55):**  this.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:56):**  And whilst I've been farming on and off my whole life, when it's yours and they're your  
**[0:32:59-0:33:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:32:59):**  animals it's all of a sudden it's very, very different.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:02):**  So for me, that's probably my lowest point has been probably quite recently with this  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:07):**  really, really wet autumn, we've had some issues with worms and other bits and bobs  
**[0:33:12-0:33:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:12):**  that yeah, that's been pretty tough at a mental health level for me just dealing with that  
**[0:33:18-0:33:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:18):**  stuff and enormous amount of pressure.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:20):**  So yeah, but I mean, I think as dad said, you haven't buggered up until you repeat it.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:25):**  So if I get to this time next year and I'm whinging about the same thing, you'd have  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:29):**  to say I'm really not a very good manager.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:31):**  So I really believe in the powers of observation and reflection and I'm always doing that.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:37):**  So I'm really, I believe as clear as I can be on how I've reacted and what it is that  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:42):**  I'm dealing with and therefore what I need to do to change, improve or maintain that  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:47):**  in the future.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:48):**  So yeah.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:50):**  Love it Sam.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:51):**  Thank you.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:52):**  Really good stuff.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:53):**  Pleasure.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sam-tretheway-on-carbon-positive-beef#t=0:33:54):**  So that's a wrap on episode two in our Regen Ag series.

### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 29 Jun 2022 20:03:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to another episode of AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agtenti Group.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:06):**  I'm Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:07):**  This week, we're bringing you the final episode in our series on the future of ag insurance,  
**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:12):**  and we're pumped about it.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:13):**  Our journey started with learning the ins and outs of how the sector currently operates,  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:17):**  and talking to key players about where the weak points are and where technology might  
**[0:00:21-0:00:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:21):**  make the most difference.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:22):**  Those conversations and all the research culminated in a conversation I had with my co-founder  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:27):**  Matthew Pryor, where we decided to hit record as we talked through our learnings and attempted  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:31):**  to solidify them into a thesis on the space.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:33):**  Two notes here before we jump in.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:34):**  First, if you haven't yet, before listening to today's episode, you'll want to have listened  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:39):**  to our last episode with Damon Johnson on parametric insurance.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:43):**  The insurance 101 bonus episode that we put out just before the Damon episode is also  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:47):**  handy for understanding some of the concepts we fly through today.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:50):**  Second, we're going to be forming some, we think, well-informed theses in this episode.  
**[0:00:56-0:00:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:56):**  But if you think we got it wrong or we're missing something important, we'd love to  
**[0:00:59-0:01:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:00:59):**  hear your thoughts.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:01:01):**  We'll share our contact details at the end of the episode.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:01:03):**  In the meantime, we'll drop you right in where our 101 episode left off with the realization  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:01:07):**  that there are a lot of layers of people and businesses in the old school ag insurance  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:01:11):**  game, which is definitely not digitally native.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:01:15):**  To us, that means there's probably plenty of room to use technology to improve the experience  
**[0:01:19-0:01:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:01:19):**  and cut down on the number of people in the middle.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:01:22):**  But it's worth understanding how the industry got this way in the first place.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:01:25):**  Here's Matthew.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:01:26):**  Traditionally, the insurance has attempted to ensure a physical good against loss or  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:01:37):**  damage.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:01:39):**  And that adds two complexities.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:01:41):**  A, what is the physical good really worth and is it really there in the first place?  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:01:48):**  And then the second is what kind of damage really happened to it?  
**[0:01:52-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:01:52):**  And is that damage partial, total, and what would it cost to make the physical good again?  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:02):**  And because we're in that world, we're in that real world and we're attempting to protect  
**[0:02:08-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:08):**  ourselves against real things, the cost of policy assessment is really high.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:15):**  Worse than that, the cost of policy configuration is really high and the cost of policy assessment  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:21):**  and payout is really high.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:23):**  The configuration is what you mean, like the first part, like the structure of the industry  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:27):**  and how things get created and development of the products.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:30):**  Home and contents insurance, right?  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:32):**  Like what all actually is in my house?  
**[0:02:34-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:34):**  Yes.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:35):**  But that's the assessment and payout part, right?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:37):**  What do you say construction?  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:38):**  No, because what I pay, what I'm insuring against, the policy price has to be.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:44):**  And so they're going to say to me, we've got a piano and a really expensive cello and a  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:51):**  really expensive violin.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:52):**  Well, how much do I want to insure those for?  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:55):**  And if I'm going to say 25 grand because it's my grandmother's or whatever, they're going  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:02:59):**  to want me to take it to a valuer.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:03:00):**  And so that's an extreme example, which you get my point.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:03:03):**  Like I said, look, you can insure it for five grand and we don't need any further evidence.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:03:07):**  But if you, on a per individual piece of property basis, if you want to insure that individual  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:03:12):**  piece of property for more than that, then we need more proof.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:03:16):**  You see where I'm going with this, which is one of our key observations is effectively  
**[0:03:20-0:03:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:03:20):**  when you zoom out and look at insurance, it's a really high CAC, really high LTV market,  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:03:28):**  right?  
**[0:03:29-0:03:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:03:29):**  Customer acquisition costs super high, product price generally is high, has to be as a consequence.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:03:36):**  And the long-term value of that customer typically is high because the kind of relationship you  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:03:41):**  need to build with them tends to stick.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:03:43):**  I understand why LTV is high because of that physical, like if it's how, let me look at  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:03:49):**  your cello and look at your farm, assess the hail damage, come out and understand what  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:03:53):**  assets you have that is sticky and is a deep relationship.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:03:56):**  And you've already committed psychologically to share that information.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:03:59):**  And the cost of acquisition seems like in one world, it would be low because the underwriters  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:07):**  are just doing what they want to do.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:08):**  There's not a lot of like customization and tailoring.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:11):**  And so that would be low, but so why is it high?  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:14):**  Because the easiest thing you could possibly do is get insurance for something that you  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:18):**  don't even own and then claim that it got stolen or lost or damaged or.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:24):**  Got it.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:25):**  So the same thing applies when I'm configuring the policy and setting it up is I need to  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:30):**  know that you have the cello and that it's whatever.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:32):**  Correct.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:33):**  Got it.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:34):**  Correct.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:35):**  Whether the crop really was there or the crop wasn't actually damaged, or in fact, you didn't  
**[0:04:39-0:04:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:39):**  put the fertilizer down.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:40):**  And so you really couldn't afford the fertilizer.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:42):**  So you didn't fertilize.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:43):**  So you had a shit crop anyway.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:45):**  And so the hail damage that was caused didn't really diminish much because you didn't have  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:49):**  much to start with.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:51):**  And because of this complexity, right on all sides of the class of risk that we're enduring  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:56):**  against and all that kind of thing.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:04:58):**  And just the inherent complexity of both configuring selling and assessing.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:05:01):**  Cause if I'm going to send people out, imagine what it's like in Queensland and New South  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:05:05):**  Wales at the moment, loss assessors all over the place.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:05:11):**  And so that's kind of our key observation, right?  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:05:13):**  If we're thinking about this as a market that is going to be fundamentally changed with  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:05:19):**  a digitally native version of all this, then there's a whole lot of areas where digitally  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:05:25):**  native products could potentially have really high impact.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:05:29):**  So the first is what is it that we're insuring against?  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:05:34):**  And if we say that obviously weather for ag is one of the big variables that you're insuring  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:05:40):**  against, then the kind of, I guess maybe the first sort of set of iterations there were  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:05:45):**  one I just ensure against the weather risk itself.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:05:50):**  Don't necessarily the damage that it caused.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:05:54):**  And so that's where you start to think about different products and they weather index  
**[0:05:58-0:06:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:05:58):**  insurance specific kind of weather event.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:06:01):**  And so rather than saying, I want to ensure the value of my crop.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:06:06):**  You can say, look, at this point in time, I know that if I get a frost in these two  
**[0:06:10-0:06:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:06:10):**  weeks, that's going to mean it's almost impossible for me for the planting to have been successful.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:06:17):**  And yeah, the first is like different class of insurance product.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:06:21):**  Parametric insurance is that's what that is.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:06:23):**  Index based or parametric insurance is basically saying we're moving away from what's referred  
**[0:06:29-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:06:29):**  to as indemnity based.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:06:30):**  So you're indemnifying me against the actual loss to index based or parametric, which is  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:06:37):**  to say, I'm just insuring against something happening or not happening.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:06:43):**  And I get to buy the level of protection that I want.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:06:47):**  And the double advantage of that is it's a lot more binary in terms of payout and potentially  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:06:53):**  then the product itself becomes a lot more configurable.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:06:59):**  And that was the really interesting area that in the very first instance is making the product  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:07:05):**  much more about what a sophisticated buyer would want and a lot more specific.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:07:11):**  And if you're able to make it a lot more specific, just set aside getting the underwriters comfortable  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:07:17):**  for now, if you're able to make it a lot more specific, then it can be a lot more adaptable  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:07:23):**  and responsive.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:07:24):**  The unlock codes there for why you can make it more specific or adaptable or responsive  
**[0:07:32-0:07:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:07:32):**  is because you've, when you move from indemnity to parametric, it's based on you've simplified  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:07:42):**  the landscape in that you don't have to go out with all these physical requirements and  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:07:46):**  assess the hail loss and do all these things.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:07:48):**  So you've got more margin to play with to shift elsewhere, which is basically more spend.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:07:55):**  And we're saying shift it to the customer experience.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:07:58):**  Let's stay in the product realm for now before we get into the go-to-market, but for sure  
**[0:08:03-0:08:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:08:03):**  in the, it significantly opens up the palette as far as the sorts of products that you can  
**[0:08:10-0:08:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:08:10):**  put in the market and allows them to be a lot more responsive to what a sophisticated  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:08:17):**  buyer would want or allow them to stack.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:08:20):**  I just need frost protection for these three weeks after planting.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:08:24):**  I understand the result.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:08:25):**  I'm trying to understand the driver.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:08:27):**  So what is it about shifting to parametric that means you can have new products just  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:08:33):**  because you're in a different box, like you're in this box and so what are the products in  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:08:36):**  this box or is there like, because it's less expensive and you're using models or what  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:08:40):**  is it?  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:08:41):**  Yeah, I think it's technological innovation as well as product innovation.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:08:46):**  So the first is that we now have networks that measure weather across the entire globe.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:08:51):**  We literally have networks of weather stations plus radars in satellites, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:08:58):**  So part of the unlock is the factory has no roof and we know that surface temperature  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:09:03):**  and surface moisture and wind and weather conditions like to the level of accuracy that  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:09:10):**  anybody cares about for every square foot of the globe.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:09:16):**  And that gets more true every six months than it was the six months prior.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:09:20):**  So the first is we just have a different source of truth that the product can be drawn against.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:09:30):**  I was trying to get to the like why, is it just it is possible to do this now?  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:09:36):**  So the first is yes, why now, because it's actually technologically possible.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:09:41):**  And also, so it's not just the sensing part but the modeling part.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:09:45):**  So sometimes the sensors aren't high enough resolution.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:09:48):**  And so you now have gridded weather models that probably are a fusion of directly sensed  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:09:57):**  and radar or satellite acquired.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:10:02):**  And it's increasingly the case that those are both spatially and temporally high resolution  
**[0:10:08-0:10:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:10:08):**  and are considered to be sufficiently accurate by the underwriters to base the actual decision  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:10:15):**  on.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:10:16):**  So they've done their work and said, yeah, actually this model like spits out stuff that's  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:10:21):**  easily accurate enough for us to not actually need someone to go there and look at the rain  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:10:26):**  gauge.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:10:27):**  So that's A, technical, but B also, well, that means we used to be limited in our ability  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:10:34):**  to put a product in the market because we needed assessors in that geographic area because  
**[0:10:38-0:10:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:10:38):**  they would have to go and visit and do the assessment.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:10:41):**  Now when you don't physically need to assess anything, all of a sudden geographically you're  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:10:48):**  completely freed up as well.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:10:50):**  And I think those things then have created this product innovation opportunity, which  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:10:55):**  is that, wow, if I don't need assessors in that area, I can all of a sudden service customers  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:11:00):**  in new markets.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:11:01):**  So it's both a new product, but also potentially new geographic and new risk.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:11:09):**  So then if it was an incremental improvement, it would be like, let's use the same value  
**[0:11:15-0:11:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:11:15):**  chain, the same industry structure, but improve the product set that the current people distribute.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:11:24):**  And that's like a change that's already happening in, but what we're saying, is there an opportunity  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:11:30):**  when you overlay, okay, now that this technology is possible, what would the digital digitally  
**[0:11:35-0:11:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:11:35):**  native version of the supply chain look like?  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:11:37):**  And if I look totally different than the supply chain does now.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:11:40):**  Correct.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:11:41):**  Yep.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:11:42):**  That's 100% the way that I have come to look at it, which is yes, those two overlapping  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:11:46):**  things that, that kind of product innovation, which just means you can put different products  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:11:50):**  in the market.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:11:51):**  And one role sort of could be the digitization just takes place somewhere between the master  
**[0:11:59-0:12:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:11:59):**  general agent and the underwriter.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:12:01):**  So one of our market structure questions was why wouldn't the underwriter do this anyway?  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:12:06):**  Why wouldn't they just digitally extend forward and put the digital cost in the market?  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:12:12):**  What would that like, they would build software that then the retailers or brokers, correct,  
**[0:12:19-0:12:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:12:19):**  white label to their customers.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:12:21):**  Yeah, maybe white label or yeah, sure.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:12:23):**  So that would be one question.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:12:24):**  The second would be that, you know, effectively the master general agent just becomes fully  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:12:29):**  digital.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:12:30):**  Maybe doesn't need the broker as much, goes straight to retail possibly.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:12:34):**  Maybe could also more easily front different underwriters.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:12:38):**  So normally as a master general agent, I would probably have a couple of key relationships  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:12:43):**  with underwriters is how I've understood it.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:12:45):**  And so I guess you would put that in more in the sort of traditional business relationship  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:12:52):**  space, not the kind of two-sided marketplace space.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:12:56):**  So now the potential model would be, it's more of a two-sided marketplace and we've  
**[0:13:00-0:13:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:13:00):**  got the retail or, you know, broking and retailing on one side and underwriting on the other.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:13:07):**  And so now the possible role that we saw there was, okay, so sort of like a matchmaker, I  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:13:14):**  could potentially do product innovation on one side and I could potentially have risk  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:13:20):**  matching sort of thing.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:13:22):**  It would be like maybe like real estate.com or something, right?  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:13:25):**  We've got the kind of, it's still actually largely real estate agents who are listing  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:13:29):**  their properties and it's still largely people who are looking, but yeah, it's more acting  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:13:35):**  like a two-sided marketplace rather than I'm not buying the houses and then selling them  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:13:39):**  myself.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:13:40):**  And if we were going to believe that that kind of company was the one we'd want to back,  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:13:44):**  we'd have to believe that both sides of the market and the MGA has changed because the  
**[0:13:49-0:13:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:13:49):**  product side has to be shifting so that they're more easily able to put stuff into this market  
**[0:13:56-0:13:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:13:56):**  and want to do it digitally.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:13:58):**  And that the retailers want to accept this kind of marketplace experience upstream.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:03):**  Yep.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:04):**  And I'm not, I didn't land there in particular.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:06):**  I think I'm just charting the evolution of our thinking.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:09):**  There's one thing I'm not clear on yet, which is where product innovation happens in the  
**[0:14:15-0:14:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:15):**  conventional way, like who originates the innovation.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:18):**  And I think that would have an impact on if that were the model, then that thinking would  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:25):**  have an impact.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:26):**  I think where we end up with, okay, that's interesting, but it feels like there's more  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:30):**  that can be disruptive here.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:32):**  And I think that's where you get into the observations around the CAC to LTV kind of  
**[0:14:37-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:37):**  questions.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:39):**  So one is that Master General agent digitizes perhaps becoming a two-sided market.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:43):**  Another one is that the retailer actually presents the products to market differently.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:49):**  Oh, for sure.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:51):**  Yes, that's absolutely the case.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:54):**  Okay.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:55):**  So we could talk about that part, which is the sort of customer experience part I think  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:14:58):**  will transform the fastest.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:15:02):**  And so specifically in that case, it's the retailer ends up selling a digital product  
**[0:15:08-0:15:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:15:08):**  and they will sell it in a similar way, but they probably don't need their insurance expert.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:15:15):**  They probably need someone who can help the customer, but the customer literally goes  
**[0:15:18-0:15:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:15:18):**  to that, to a dashboard and says, okay, I want to ensure $150,000 against not getting  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:15:27):**  this many millimeters of rain in these three weeks.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:15:30):**  And so that's literally a dashboard with a bunch of sliders.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:15:33):**  The limits of where the sliders can go effectively is already fixed.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:15:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:15:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:15:41):**  But somewhere in that broker MGA underwriter sphere, somebody has agreed what the limits  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:15:50):**  are to that app.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:15:53):**  And the limits will be in the areas of what actual risk pricing and number of policies.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:15:59):**  Yeah, it's just a new presentation of the product that the underwriter designed in a  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:04):**  more digitally native way, but it's the same product that's gone through the same channel  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:07):**  and the retailer's like, I want to present it.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:09):**  I want to give the customer real or perceived more user experience and customization within  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:16):**  parameters that someone else already defined.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:19):**  Yep.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:20):**  So lots of agree with that.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:21):**  It's changing the way the product is sold, but not substantially the parties involved.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:25):**  I think save for the one big question, which is who's the product innovator here.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:30):**  So, okay.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:31):**  If we believe that it won't just be the players in the existing market digitizing, it will  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:35):**  be new players entering the market because they're bringing new products.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:39):**  Sure.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:41):**  That, yeah.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:42):**  One way you could look at it is you look at the box.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:44):**  If there's a box around MGA and broker, that kind of gets pretty blurry and how far back  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:52):**  it pushes into underwriting and how far forward it pushes into retailing.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:16:55):**  I think both the kind of bound and internals of that box could be very blurry.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:17:02):**  And again, depending on the nature of risk and regulatory pressures, who the actual underwriter  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:17:10):**  is could also get interesting, right?  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:17:13):**  Because you could say, okay, if we can get regulatory approval, there are certain kinds  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:17:17):**  of risk that we might be better at assessing.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:17:20):**  And therefore maybe we'll just take our balance sheet or somebody else's balance sheet, who's  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:17:24):**  not an underwriter and strike the policies ourselves.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:17:28):**  The reason why that's tough in particularly in ag, particularly in key markets of the  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:17:33):**  US and China being the two key markets is the government is the biggest underwriter  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:17:37):**  of ag policies, like by a very long margin.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:17:41):**  And so it's generally thought that's a pretty hard nut to crack if you're going to choose  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:17:46):**  to make your money in underwriting.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:17:47):**  But I think the thing is again, interesting.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:17:49):**  So let me break that down just to make sure I understand.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:17:51):**  So if you're in the world where we think new products will enter the market defined by  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:17:58):**  new players, and we're trying to figure out what do those new players end up becoming  
**[0:18:02-0:18:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:18:02):**  or end up looking like, one world is that they sell them to or work with existing underwriters.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:18:09):**  Another world is that they unlock new underwriters.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:18:11):**  And we're saying that seems hard because the big underwriters also create the policies.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:18:16):**  And so probably having new ones seems challenging or, and the final, and it's not mutually  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:18:21):**  exclusive, is that they put new products into market and become more like retailers or work  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:18:27):**  more with retailers because they're enabling the customer experience more or blending into  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:18:33):**  how the presentation would look to customers and providing a solution to retailers.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:18:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:18:38):**  I guess if the frame here is disruption or disintermediation of how agriculturally aligned  
**[0:18:45-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:18:45):**  insurance is framed, marketed, underwritten, then I think you can imagine the size and  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:18:53):**  scope of that disruption being as big as you want.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:18:56):**  The reasons why that would seem to be very challenging is for a lot of the normal reasons,  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:19:03):**  which is that the channel is already very strongly aligned.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:19:06):**  And so trying to bite off individual parts of it, like why would we go with you when  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:19:12):**  we're risking all this other business that we do with this?  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:19:15):**  So that's the first challenge.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:19:16):**  The second challenge is the closer you get to underwriting, the more regulated it becomes.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:19:24):**  And so you've just literally got how much work, how much prudential oversize there on  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:19:30):**  us if we choose to go in it.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:19:32):**  And third is margin contention, which could just be from existing competition.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:19:38):**  Companies are very big balance sheets, and in addition to that, the amount of money you  
**[0:19:45-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:19:45):**  can make in those markets is often also disproportionately influenced by governments because the government  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:19:54):**  is a big underwriter of policies.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:19:58):**  And so they're just going to effectively limit the profitability because if they think that  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:20:07):**  you're taking too high a margin, they're just going to enter the market in competition against  
**[0:20:11-0:20:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:20:11):**  you and or regulate you into reasonable profit margins.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:20:18):**  We covered a lot there already, and we have a bit more to go.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:20:21):**  So let's take a bit of a half time break here to check in on our key observations so far.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:20:26):**  First, in traditional indemnity insurance, including ag insurance, CAC is high because  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:20:31):**  before a company offers a policy to a customer, they want to know that you have the thing  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:20:35):**  and that it's worth what you say it's worth.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:20:37):**  It takes resources to establish that upfront.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:20:40):**  Then it takes even more resources to determine that what you say has happened when you make  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:20:44):**  a claim was actually caused by the event that you were insured against.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:20:49):**  It's a clunky, people-heavy, largely analog process, and the customer pays for it in a  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:20:53):**  hefty premium.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:20:54):**  But because of the relationship that's built in this process, LTV is also high.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:20:59):**  Once a customer has built trust with an insurance agent, they're generally loath to start the  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:21:03):**  process over.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:21:04):**  That led us to think about what, fundamentally, we're insuring against.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:21:07):**  If weather is the risk, then why not insure against the weather itself rather than the  
**[0:21:11-0:21:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:21:11):**  damage it causes?  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:21:13):**  It's way easier to know the weather and so way cheaper to assess, meaning companies could  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:21:17):**  redirect resources from analog processes to better products.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:21:21):**  That then opens the door to many possible products, including parametric or index, rather  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:21:25):**  than indemnity-based insurance, which could end up being more adaptive, responsive, and  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:21:30):**  therefore desirable to buyers.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:21:32):**  What's exciting is that the data and modeling tech to do this is largely in place today,  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:21:37):**  and modern tech teams could make easy work of a possible product, say a dashboard that  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:21:41):**  a farmer could use to tailor very flexible insurance offerings to their specific needs  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:21:46):**  within defined bounds.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:21:48):**  Questions remain, though, about whether mostly new or existing players will originate these  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:21:52):**  kinds of innovations, because they each face different challenges.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:21:56):**  The depth of existing channels where new products might threaten old businesses is one.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:22:01):**  You also have the risk of regulation as you get closer to the underwriter, and then you  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:22:05):**  have margin contention and having to go head to head with the government, not to mention  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:22:08):**  all the data analysis and software development.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:22:11):**  Considering these challenges led us to ask, what would a new product look like that's  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:22:16):**  more valuable to underwriters and to retailers?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:22:19):**  Here's Matthew again.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:22:20):**  I think it still feels like there are significant disintermediation and reconfiguration opportunities.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:22:26):**  So I think two things become true that there's margin distribution opportunity, right?  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:22:32):**  By taking up more of a role or replacing a role or effectively redistributing margin,  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:22:37):**  being able to earn more of the margin than the current players by replacing some subset  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:22:41):**  of them or putting a better offering in this pros and cons there.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:22:45):**  The second is you can write a lot different policies, right?  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:22:50):**  So if we said the current market is high CAC, high LDB, and so you can only service a certain  
**[0:22:55-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:22:55):**  part of the market, right?  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:22:56):**  And this is increasingly becoming a problem with insurance, which is the better you understand  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:23:02):**  the risk, the more expensive the policy is likely to be.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:23:06):**  Because if it's real and you want to get insurance against it, then it's quite likely to happen.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:23:10):**  And therefore an insurer is going to want a decent payment for the policy if it's quite  
**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:23:14):**  likely to happen.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:23:15):**  So the interesting thing when we push into weather is both parametric unlocks flexibility  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:23:22):**  and therefore the potential to write cheaper as in cheaper to strike policies because it's  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:23:28):**  just go to the website, put the dial, we'll give you the price if you like the price,  
**[0:23:32-0:23:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:23:32):**  pay it.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:23:33):**  And then we know that payout is like instantaneous because either the thing did or did not happen.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:23:38):**  We can assess that digitally and you get your pay out straight away, right?  
**[0:23:42-0:23:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:23:42):**  So that's great.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:23:43):**  We've taken so much friction out of the market and therefore potentially can write lots more  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:23:50):**  policies.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:23:51):**  And potentially you've opened up the market massively by significantly lowering KAC, probably  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:23:58):**  lower LTV2 because it's very targeted and temporally in terms of both the event and  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:24:04):**  the time period.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:24:05):**  The other really interesting thing is whether as a risk is just getting bigger and bigger  
**[0:24:13-0:24:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:24:13):**  and both our ability to sense and model it and the fact that we're locked in, God help  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:24:22):**  us probably to two degrees already.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:24:26):**  And so weather is going to be a bigger risk and is going to cause more damage.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:24:34):**  And so the other part is that like costs of policies are going to go up because the kind  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:24:41):**  of risks that farming in particular is going to be exposed to are going to be higher and  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:24:46):**  more frequent.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:24:47):**  So on the one hand, that's a really good thing because it means the farmers can be a lot  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:24:52):**  more targeted, but it also will mean probably that a lot of the insurance that they would  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:24:58):**  otherwise like to buy will start to be quite expensive.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:25:03):**  And so I think that's more of a creating a really interesting challenge.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:25:07):**  We've sort of the unlock part is given us more flexibility, more insight, more understanding,  
**[0:25:13-0:25:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:25:13):**  ability to be more targeted.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:25:14):**  Also like how valuable are these products to farmers?  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:25:17):**  Cause it's one thing like the technology allows us to create them and we can have toggle your  
**[0:25:22-0:25:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:25:22):**  slider by this thing.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:25:23):**  But if you're only insuring against some percent of my actual risk or it only is some percent  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:25:29):**  of my overall picture, isn't even worth buying.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:25:34):**  Exactly.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:25:35):**  So that kind of gets us into user versus beneficiary land, which is yes.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:25:41):**  At that individual farmer level, like the whole point of insurance is pooling, right?  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:25:46):**  You can ensure people because you're putting them in a pool and not everybody in that pool  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:25:50):**  is going to suffer that harm.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:25:52):**  And so if everybody contributes a dollar, then you know, those dollars can be used to  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:25:58):**  compensate the much smaller number of people who actually are exposed to the harm.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:26:02):**  But when everybody is being exposed to greater weather risk, that doesn't work as well.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:26:08):**  A and then B yes.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:26:10):**  If you're pooling, why are you pooling?  
**[0:26:13-0:26:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:26:13):**  Originally we pooled just to merge risk, but if you're downstream in a supply chain, then  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:26:22):**  the way you think about pooling is very different.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:26:24):**  It's actually a supply chain risk.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:26:27):**  And so I think that's where we get into the much bigger change, which is when we think  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:26:34):**  about who the beneficiary is, we then start to think about embedding a lot more.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:26:40):**  And we start to think about a completely different channel for provision of these services and  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:26:47):**  where that we've started to see much more customized.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:26:52):**  So in a way, and we had this conversation, don't just digitally transform an industrial  
**[0:26:58-0:27:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:26:58):**  era product, create the digitally native product based on its greatest strengths.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:27:06):**  And so that lends you to think much more about the kind of embedded insurance that is tied  
**[0:27:12-0:27:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:27:12):**  to a forward supply contract, right?  
**[0:27:14-0:27:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:27:14):**  That is tied to the supply of a new grain variety where that new grain variety has a  
**[0:27:21-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:27:21):**  much shorter crop cycle, but just is particularly susceptible to abiotic stress in the first  
**[0:27:28-0:27:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:27:28):**  week.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:27:29):**  And so it makes sense to embed insurance with that seed for a replacement, right?  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:27:38):**  Because those three weeks we've lost, so we would then have to replace it with something  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:27:42):**  that's probably lower economic value, but much more hardy.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:27:45):**  And so we're not trying to ensure against the loss where, you know, getting one kind  
**[0:27:52-0:27:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:27:52):**  of product as insurance against another, which I think that then opens up the pallet just  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:27:59):**  so much wider.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:28:01):**  And that's where you're really talking about digitally naive because you're just completely  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:28:05):**  ignoring the existing way of doing it, but not even better way of doing it.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:28:09):**  One argument might be now their CAC is going to be so high.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:28:14):**  It's a bit like we view the carbon project developers now.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:28:17):**  Yeah, you're going to make some money for a while, but your CAC is so high, you can't  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:28:22):**  possibly compete with supply chain embedding for carbon eventually.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:28:27):**  Like you're going to get smoked.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:28:28):**  And that's a way I think that you could view the kind of embedding and also why just insurance?  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:28:36):**  Like that's dumb.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:28:37):**  You would put credit and insurance together and marketing.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:28:42):**  So I think that digitally native also just, I think causes you to think completely differently  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:28:48):**  about this, about that structure.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:28:50):**  Right.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:28:51):**  You get into this challenge though, of like on the insurance side, if you're solving for  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:28:56):**  lower cost, larger market, you're losing granularity, right?  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:29:01):**  It's not this individual farm, it's this area against this weather event and whether that  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:29:06):**  hail storm actually hit that specific farm or not is not really the point.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:29:10):**  It's did it occur in the area?  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:29:11):**  I mean, I think though, yep, for sure.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:29:13):**  So here I stopped at the imagining where the new degrees of freedom are.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:29:20):**  I think that again, like from an investor point of view, then for sure, we could imagine  
**[0:29:26-0:29:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:29:26):**  that there's three or four kind of plausible hypotheses for new players, new products.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:29:33):**  I think on the one hand, the preferencing, the indexing for the really sophisticated  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:29:38):**  buyer.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:29:39):**  Who literally wants the dashboard with all the la la la la la and tracking costs and  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:29:46):**  the whole deal.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:29:47):**  And I think that's pretty plausible.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:29:48):**  And I think secondarily or maybe completely separately, there's like a Stripe for risk,  
**[0:29:53-0:30:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:29:53):**  which is just anybody who's striking a forward contract just wants the ability to probably  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:30:03):**  build out a building blocks, sell off to an underwriter and embed in their contract because  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:30:08):**  it's going to be, it's more about protecting their interests, not about what the individual  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:30:12):**  farmer wants to protect themselves against the risks they're exposed to.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:30:17):**  And I think both of those probably happen.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:30:20):**  The degree to which one becomes bigger than the other probably has more to do with just  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:30:26):**  as different classes of farmers out there.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:30:28):**  And some of them are price takers and some of them are price sort of developers.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:30:34):**  Yep.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:30:35):**  Yeah, you get into then what are the possible business models and then what do you have  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:30:42):**  to be good at or where would you come at that business from?  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:30:44):**  Are you going to come at it from the modeling side and you want to be deep in the technologies  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:30:48):**  and how you're going to have a better product?  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:30:51):**  Or are you going to be deep on the enterprise sales side because it's much more customer  
**[0:30:57-0:30:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:30:57):**  facing?  
**[0:30:58-0:30:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:30:58):**  Yep.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:30:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:31:00):**  So do we just want to be selling the temperature or do we want to say we can put a heat index  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:31:07):**  product into the market at lower cost and higher accuracy than anybody else on the planet?  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:31:13):**  And so just to vertically integrate to become an originator of heat index insurance.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:31:19):**  And so that's exactly the, I think the next part for us, which is who would win?  
**[0:31:23-0:31:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:31:23):**  What are the configurations that would win?  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:31:24):**  I think that the things that we will, we would get criticized for if we just put this recording  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:31:29):**  out on the internet is like, oh, these guys don't really understand how insurance works  
**[0:31:32-0:31:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:31:32):**  and that's not, that's blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:31:35):**  And I'm sure that's true in terms of, I will have confused a bunch of terms together.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:31:42):**  And absolutely if you have spent your life in underwriting, you'll say, oh, they can't  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:31:46):**  possibly blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:31:48):**  And to that, I would just say Netflix.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:31:52):**  The studio system is impenetrable.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:31:54):**  I mean, it just doesn't matter.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:31:55):**  I think that the reality of what the food system is going to be exposed to is unparalleled  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:32:03):**  level of weather related risk.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:32:06):**  And so for sure, the kind of climatological side of that is super, super important.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:32:11):**  And absolutely the underwriters are deep, deep on that.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:32:14):**  But I mean, in the end, that's 30 scientists or something.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:32:18):**  If I go and offer them a million dollar salary, I'm going to, I'll yank those people out of  
**[0:32:22-0:32:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:32:22):**  those underwriters in no time flat.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:32:25):**  And so I think that's the thing that becomes interesting, which is like how disruptive  
**[0:32:30-0:32:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:32:30):**  or how much of a new structure could you imagine and put together without worrying too much  
**[0:32:37-0:32:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:32:37):**  about how insurance currently works or where the market power is in insurance.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:32:43):**  I think it goes to what kind of company are you?  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:32:44):**  Because you don't really have to understand as much if you're winning based on I enable  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:32:49):**  my customers to continually develop the best products, right there.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:32:52):**  I'm just going to index on the technology to, so they have better products.

**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:02):**  the technology, but also your customers in the market who are some of which are existing  
**[0:33:06-0:33:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:06):**  insurance players.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:08):**  But depending on the business model, maybe you're also it's enterprise sales to food  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:12):**  companies or you're putting together partnerships with companies.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:15):**  And so then you need a different understanding.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:18):**  So I think that's where it gets interesting.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:20):**  If then you're not deemed to be selling insurance, especially, I think that's especially interesting  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:24):**  in that kind of B2B sense, which is it's just a service.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:28):**  And in the end, I'm not insuring against a loss or are you like, you're taking the retail  
**[0:33:33-0:33:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:33):**  part out of it.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:34):**  I think that's when it becomes super interesting.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:37):**  What a strike.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:39):**  Are they a bank?  
**[0:33:40-0:33:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:40):**  Do they need banking licenses in the current?  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:43):**  Probably like this is who cares, but they just offer me everything that I need.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:49):**  And they, I think that's the thing that becomes really interesting in that CAC to LTV when  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:54):**  it's fully digital.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:55):**  And then we've said, there's just no reason for a high CAC.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:33:59):**  I mean, that's God, I don't know if you youngsters probably never had to actually set up like  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:34:04):**  a credit card facility, but it was crazy.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:34:08):**  The amount of that they would come and do an audit of your website to check the SSL  
**[0:34:14-0:34:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:34:14):**  certificate.

**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:34:19):**  truck and drive around a cornfield and literally come up with their own personal assessment  
**[0:34:25-0:34:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:34:25):**  of how much loss was suffered.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:34:28):**  That's just so dead.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:34:30):**  Needless to say, we will be pushing into these kinds of possible futures and continuing to  
**[0:34:35-0:34:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:34:35):**  track companies who are doing so.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:34:37):**  If you are one or if you know one, please reach out.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:34:40):**  But for now, we've got a working theory of what the future of ag insurance might look  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:34:43):**  like and how ag tech companies might make the industry more modern, user centric and  
**[0:34:47-0:34:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:34:47):**  cost efficient.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:34:48):**  I'm still pondering a few questions in the aftermath of this conversation, though.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:34:52):**  First, I wonder how much scope there is for data collection companies that are specifically  
**[0:34:57-0:34:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:34:57):**  focused on ag insurance.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:34:59):**  Or will the ag insurance world just experience spillover benefits from all the quantum leaps  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:03):**  that data and sensing tech are making in other industries?  
**[0:35:06-0:35:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:06):**  Maybe you will see some interesting partnerships form?  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:08):**  Either way, having access to more information and the modeling chops to use it will be key.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:13):**  Next, it's pretty clear to me that as we have more climate variability and more frequent  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:18):**  extreme weather events due to climate change, the ag insurance industry will feel the impacts.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:22):**  For farmers, products will be harder to get and more expensive.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:26):**  How strong of a driver will this be, though, and how quickly for insurance companies to  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:30):**  innovate?  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:31):**  Will a winning strategy be to build, buy or partner?  
**[0:35:34-0:35:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:34):**  And how much of a fundamental shift is even possible when the government has such a heavy  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:38):**  hand in some geographies?  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:40):**  The final area where I still have some questions is these novel products.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:43):**  I actually think there's a good chance that embedded insurance turns out to be a powerful  
**[0:35:47-0:35:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:47):**  tool for companies and producers alike.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:50):**  But I wonder what kind of effects these products will have for established companies and even  
**[0:35:54-0:35:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:54):**  industry structures.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:35:55):**  When farmers can buy insurance that's tied to the fungicide or biostimulant or whatever  
**[0:36:00-0:36:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:36:00):**  that they want to use, who will they buy it from?  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:36:03):**  And when we overlay opportunities like carbon markets with these risk management tools,  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:36:07):**  will we see opportunities for insurance and risk products tied to sustainability outcomes  
**[0:36:12-0:36:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:36:12):**  because all the data is sitting in the same place?  
**[0:36:14-0:36:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:36:14):**  It would certainly require some changes to business models and mindsets.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:36:18):**  So that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What, and for our three-part series on  
**[0:36:22-0:36:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/6/29/ag-insurance-so-what#t=0:36:22):**  the future of ag insurance.

**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:00:15):**  back a decade? Ah yes, Silicon Valley, California. It's the

**[0:00:28-0:00:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:00:28):**  of modern technology, quite literally taking its name from  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:00:31):**  the region sand, which contained the silicon used to manufacture

**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:00:46):**  PayPal, Facebook, Intel, Alphabet, and of course, Apple.

**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:00:55):**  as a template for startup success. Yet when it's been  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:00:59):**  applied to Ag Tech, well, we've seen mixed results.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:01:03):**  So you may think that if I can just get the farmer to adopt my  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:01:06):**  tool, then it's game over, I'm going to go disrupt the system.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:01:10):**  But you find that there's like multiple layers of that onion to  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:01:13):**  peel back before you can actually make change to that

**[0:01:19-0:01:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:01:19):**  folks have had.

**[0:01:24-0:01:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:01:24):**  of Better Food Ventures, a food and ag VC and founder of the

**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:01:49):**  with this very premise, how Silicon Valley set Ag Tech back  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:01:53):**  a decade. It struck a chord, it was a little tongue in cheek,  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:01:57):**  but it really started a conversation. So we thought we  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:01):**  dig in further. But first, let's meet Rob.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:05):**  Sure. So my name is Rob Trice. And I spent about just under 15  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:10):**  years in the mobile internet, telecom venture capital space. I  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:14):**  came here at the tail end of the.com bubble, I saw the burst.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:18):**  I was here for 9-11. I was here for 2008. When I started working  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:24):**  on the mobile internet, we were on 2G networks. It was that time  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:27):**  when people wondered why would I ever want a map or email on my  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:31):**  phone. And it was really exciting to see things like this  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:34):**  new technology called Wi-Fi really come to be in Silicon  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:38):**  Valley. But getting on with things around 2012, 13 or so I  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:43):**  just started to get tired. People are talking about 5G. And  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:46):**  in my mind, I just, I didn't have 5G in me. I've been going  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:49):**  to the same conferences, talking about the same topics for a  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:52):**  number of years. And at the same time, my wife started running  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:56):**  this regenerative cattle ranch behind us, 45 minutes West to  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:59):**  Silicon Valley out on the Pacific coast. And so I  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:03):**  literally was walking around this cattle ranch, trying to  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:05):**  figure out what I was going to do when I, you know, when I grew  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:08):**  up. And I was looking at the fact that you'd seen Uber  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:11):**  disrupt transportation, Airbnb disrupt lodging, and, um,  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:15):**  then saw a cowboy pulling an SD card out of a weather station,  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:19):**  look at these guys struggling to use square at the farmers  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:21):**  market, and realize that five to 10% of the world's economy is  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:26):**  ag food. And that Silicon Valley's innovation ecosystem  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:31):**  at that point had not yet grabbed on to food tech and ag  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:35):**  tech. And so I started two organizations, the mixing bowl  
**[0:03:37-0:03:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:37):**  and better food ventures. The mixing bowl is a forum to  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:40):**  connect it food and ag innovators for thought and action  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:43):**  leadership and better food ventures makes investments  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:46):**  across the supply chain of food and ag in information technology  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:50):**  companies looking to make a positive impact.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:52):**  Great. Matt, is there some overlap in terms of your  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:55):**  timelines and when you were in Silicon Valley?  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:58):**  Yeah, probably I was co-founder of a software business in  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:02):**  Melbourne, the late eighties, early nineties. And my first  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:06):**  exposure to Silicon Valley was a subscription newsletter  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:08):**  business. And I literally mean I mailed out newsletter. It was  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:12):**  called Software Success. And it just was we would get it once a  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:15):**  month. And it was this amazing kind of missive about all this  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:19):**  mythical stuff that would happen in this place called Silicon  
**[0:04:21-0:04:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:21):**  Valley. So eventually, we decided that we needed to be  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:24):**  there and kind of moved what we call the HQ of our software  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:29):**  business, which was myself and one of my co-founders to San  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:31):**  Francisco. And it was interesting because kind of that  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:33):**  was mid nineties. And at that time, San Francisco was sort of  
**[0:04:36-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:36):**  really on the cusp of Silicon Valley. It wasn't quite  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:38):**  considered part of Silicon Valley then. But we said that  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:41):**  we were there for about seven years as Silicon Valley just  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:45):**  expanded kind of north and the city became this incredibly  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:49):**  vibrant tech hub. It was an awesome time to be there. We  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:53):**  went kind of right through the absolute highs and the quite  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:57):**  serious lows of the original dot com era, I think is what we're  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:05:00):**  calling it now. But yeah, it was such a stark contrast to how I  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:05:04):**  had experienced kind of software. And like there was no  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:05:08):**  VC in Australia really at that time. So moving back in the kind  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:05:12):**  of mid-orts, it was interesting to sort of start to see that  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:05:17):**  appearing in Australia, but I suppose considerably behind. I  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:05:21):**  just through circumstance, kind of got invited into a project  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:05:26):**  that actually was trying to model pasture growth to estimate  
**[0:05:31-0:05:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:05:31):**  stocking rates for cattle properties in the north of

**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:10:46):**  very hilly. And my indelible memory is of a web van guy  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:10:50):**  schlepping groceries up the 35 steps to the front door of our  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:10:54):**  house. Like, web van was the first kind of deliver food to  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:10:58):**  your home kind of effort. It was typical Silicon Valley boots and  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:02):**  all like, they had their own fleet, they had their own  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:04):**  everything. They built this massive distribution center in  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:07):**  Oakland. I mean, it was like, I don't even know how many  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:09):**  hundreds of millions of dollars they set in a pile and burn.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:13):**  But I think there was the experience of just like, throw  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:16):**  enough money at it. And eventually you'll get the  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:19):**  formula right. And when you zoom out to 30,000 feet, that does  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:24):**  work. And now today, we can see how the, you know, whatever  
**[0:11:28-0:11:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:28):**  started from web van and has become what it's become today  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:31):**  worked. But I think, yeah, actually, you know, back to  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:34):**  Rob's point about, it's different in food and ag,  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:36):**  because, well, in ag, you're dealing with people's livelihoods,  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:40):**  right? And so this idea of, oh, we'll just kind of try this  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:43):**  thing. And it may not work out for you, but it'll work out  
**[0:11:45-0:11:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:45):**  fine for the people 10 years after you. Like, for the most  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:48):**  part, farmers can't and won't just take those kind of risks  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:52):**  of maybe this will work out for me, maybe it won't. And I think  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:56):**  that was kind of really where that point of difference really  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:59):**  started to show up for us really, like, I can put a whole  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:03):**  bunch of stuff on Facebook, and then maybe I delete it. And  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:05):**  like, yeah, it's not going to fundamentally change my bank  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:08):**  balance. But the decisions that farmers make on every day, a  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:12):**  basis, do, you know, fundamentally change their bank  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:15):**  balance. And so they can't be cavalier about, you know, what  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:19):**  little Silicon Valley experiment they want to be part of today  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:22):**  or tomorrow.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:23):**  Sarah, what are your insights on this?  
**[0:12:25-0:12:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:25):**  Oh, well, it actually goes to something Rob and I were talking  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:27):**  about earlier, where in some ways, like ag has been optimized  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:31):**  to remove risk, and venture capital was built to embrace risk.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:36):**  And so there's this like, fundamental disconnect in the two  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:39):**  worlds. And that's where some of this clashes come because yeah,  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:42):**  we're like, Oh, farmers, you know, they iterate every season,  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:44):**  like a season's a long time. And the number of software  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:47):**  iterations you'd get over that 12 month period is much higher  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:50):**  than one. And then the next season comes around. And it's  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:52):**  different because you've got different rainfall and the soil  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:54):**  has changed and the markets are different. And so yes, there are  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:57):**  many similarities between farmers as entrepreneurs and  
**[0:13:00-0:13:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:00):**  entrepreneurs in terms of mindset and owning businesses and  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:02):**  experimentation. But the systems are sort of optimized, almost  
**[0:13:07-0:13:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:07):**  in the exact opposite direction in terms of risk. And so I think  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:09):**  that's where venture capital can butt heads or has butt heads  
**[0:13:11-0:13:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:11):**  with with ag.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:13):**  So ridiculous asking this question, but because you're all  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:16):**  base days, but does this mean that ag tech doesn't fit with  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:20):**  venture capital?  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:21):**  Well, I'll chime in, I think there are limitations to the  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:24):**  application of the standard venture model to agriculture,  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:29):**  for exactly the point that Sarah is mentioning and what Sarah  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:34):**  and Matthew wrote about, which is, you know, if you think about  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:37):**  what Facebook, their whole motto was move fast and break things.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:41):**  Well, what if you can move fast, but you don't break things,  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:44):**  right? If you try to go disrupt the ag marketplace, but then you  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:48):**  hit a brick wall because you realize that there's an entire  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:51):**  system there to minimize risk, minimize disruption. And that's  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:57):**  not just the farmer, that's everything behind it all the way  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:00):**  to crop insurance. Right. And so you may think that if I can just  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:04):**  get the farmer to adopt my tool, then it's game over. I'm going  
**[0:14:07-0:14:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:07):**  to go disrupt the system. But you find that there's like  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:10):**  multiple layers of that onion to peel back before you can  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:14):**  actually make change to that system. And I think that's one  
**[0:14:17-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:17):**  of the big aha's that a lot of folks have had. So there are  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:20):**  certainly opportunities, but I think it's a smaller subset than  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:24):**  we might've thought about seven years ago. You know, a headline  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:28):**  always has to be brief. And so the risk in saying something  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:31):**  like how Silicon Valley killed ag tech is to imply that the  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:34):**  whole model doesn't work. And the more nuanced view is there  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:39):**  are key parts of it that are fundamental to the  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:42):**  transformation that agriculture has to make. And so the sort of  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:45):**  some of the key elements of the Silicon Valley model is driving  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:49):**  really hard on the transformative potential of  
**[0:14:52-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:52):**  digital technology in particular, but let's just say  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:54):**  technological transformation. Like that is so true of  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:57):**  agriculture that, you know, when we've got satellites flying  
**[0:15:00-0:15:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:00):**  over the entire world, couple of times a day at 30 centimeter  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:03):**  and below resolution with spectral depths and all that  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:06):**  kind of stuff, like we will know things about the in the  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:09):**  natural environment at very low cost at very high resolution  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:12):**  that we've never known before. And so that part of it is  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:15):**  absolutely true. The transformative potential in  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:20):**  technological innovation as applied to, you know, all kinds  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:23):**  of physical industries is amazing and it's inspiring. And  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:26):**  I think it what brings, you know, people like us together.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:29):**  I think that the point we're trying to make is that bringing  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:33):**  those things together along with this kind of pre-canned  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:37):**  idea of this is how users take a delivery of technology. This

**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:20:58):**  kind of fully disrupt the system and have new incumbents or new  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:02):**  transformations to the whole model. And so that's been part  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:06):**  of the challenge, and that's what we allude to being possible  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:09):**  in the next wave in certain areas, but it's definitely not  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:11):**  without its challenges. That's just what we've seen so far.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:15):**  Yeah. And just to add to that, and Matthew and Sarah talk  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:18):**  about it, but so for instance, you had a climate purchase by  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:22):**  Monsanto Bayer, you had granular purchase by DuPont, and what  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:26):**  Cortiva and what you've actually seen there is now they're  
**[0:21:29-0:21:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:29):**  giving that stuff away for free. So they did acquire it.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:32):**  They're pushing it through their channel. That's going to  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:35):**  accelerate adoption because free is a pretty good price, but  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:38):**  that's also a category killer for everybody else in the space.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:41):**  So to boil it down, as we see ag, I kind of see two paths.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:46):**  It's not that critical to think about, but it's evolutionary or  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:50):**  revolutionary. And most of the corporate VCs are probably  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:54):**  looking at the evolutionary path. There are some exceptions  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:57):**  though. I think about what Tyson did in terms of making the  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:01):**  investment in beyond me breaking out of the animal protein  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:05):**  sector for that company. Look at Driscoll's partnering with  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:09):**  plenty on indoor berry production. There's some other  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:13):**  examples out there where they're kind of sticking their toe in  
**[0:22:16-0:22:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:16):**  the revolutionary path, which will be interesting to see.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:20):**  Again, I'm not trying to hear to defend Silicon Valley or  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:24):**  ag tech investing, but if you look at that evolutionary  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:28):**  versus revolutionary path, you look at how much wind VC money  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:33):**  has put into the revolutionary or alternative sales, whether  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:39):**  that is alternative proteins, alternative production, the  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:42):**  indoor greenhouse, vertical farming, that's benefited a lot.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:47):**  We'll see if it actually changes agriculture. We're still  
**[0:22:50-0:22:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:50):**  trying to figure out the evolutionary versus revolutionary  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:53):**  path. They're going to coexist, but I think we have seen a  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:56):**  benefit by having that talent and that money come into the  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:59):**  space. Yeah. Andres and Horowitz, it's Alex Rample has an  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:03):**  interesting way of characterizing this, where they, he  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:07):**  refers to it kind of as a race where the startup is trying to  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:10):**  get distribution before the incumbent gets innovation. And  
**[0:23:14-0:23:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:14):**  I think that that's, that is part of what drives that desire  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:17):**  to kind of place those bets. And, you know, Rob, you're  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:20):**  absolutely right that, you know, some of those are very brave  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:22):**  and kind of forward thinking bits, like, as you say, betting  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:26):**  on being disrupted. But I think the other side of that coin is  
**[0:23:30-0:23:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:30):**  that a lot of the time, the Silicon Valley view is that it's  
**[0:23:33-0:23:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:33):**  it's largely about software, like innovation equals software.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:36):**  And I think that's one of the points that we're making is  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:39):**  that in Ag, that's just not true. It's not getting any less  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:43):**  true. Like when we think we've been doing a bunch of small  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:46):**  group discussions over the past couple of weeks thinking about  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:48):**  sustainability and almost every, if not every sustainability  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:52):**  problem, it's yes, we need data. Yes, we need interoperability,  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:55):**  but then we need to go physically do something in the  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:57):**  world or change something. We need to like process the waste.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:01):**  We need to make the biological, we need to turn on the pump.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:03):**  And so this idea that the software alone can be the  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:07):**  solution, yeah, maybe great economics, but if it doesn't  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:10):**  actually solve the problem, then then what are we really  
**[0:24:11-0:24:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:11):**  doing? And so that's bringing in a whole new layer of, I think,  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:14):**  Silicon Valley is evolving in this direction, too, of needing  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:17):**  to look at biology, needing to look at hardware, needing to  
**[0:24:20-0:24:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:20):**  look at deep tech, whatever you want to call it, to solve some  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:22):**  of these climate problems, especially, but in agriculture,  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:24):**  that's absolutely true. And it is a whole new skill set and  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:27):**  way of thinking about these investments.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:29):**  Is there an example anyone could give of a, and I know  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:32):**  people don't want to throw a company under the bus, but in  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:35):**  the past of an early ag tech, or maybe not even early ag tech,

**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:43):**  or even in an epic fail, if you've got a story like that,  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:46):**  what's the one that gets your 101 lesson on what not to do?  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:50):**  I'll share a war story. We had a company that shall remain

**[0:25:06-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:25:06):**  because we thought our work was done because it was now in

**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:25:12):**  And the reality was the company was, it had a little bit of  
**[0:25:16-0:25:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:25:16):**  a delay, maybe one season, but the reality was it was doing  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:25:20):**  fine as an ag tech company. We had over 90% renewal of the  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:25:26):**  product. We had good channels stepping in, but for this  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:25:30):**  Silicon Valley investor, that growth wasn't fast enough.

**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:25:39):**  the numbers to go up into the right, taking on new products,

**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:25:53):**  were a bit frustrated because we could see that this was a  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:25:56):**  good ag tech company and we're headed to the right, on the

**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:26:10):**  now. We've seen it a few times with companies that we,

**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:28:15):**  I mean, you go talk to some of these corporates who've been  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:28:17):**  pitched by 70 of those 150 accelerators to sponsor their

**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:28:23):**  new or interested or connected to my model at all. And so,  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:28:25):**  yeah, I get that, you know, some nice PR or, you know, I might  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:28:28):**  meet some smart people, but like, you know, I'm not, I'm not

**[0:28:36-0:28:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:28:36):**  has been challenging in kind of serving it up on a platter in the

**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:28:43):**  a farming corporation the other day who have a system on how to

**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:28:51):**  ag tech on their farm and they like it, but they have a system

**[0:28:56-0:28:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:28:56):**  move on to the solution. You all wouldn't be here in this

**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:07):**  can start with you. Oh, thanks for the easy one. I think it's  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:10):**  interesting. So again, I cited before the limitations of the

**[0:29:18-0:29:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:18):**  been a realization even by some of the people that are writing  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:21):**  really big checks. I'll tell you the parachute that everybody's  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:25):**  grabbing right now is the SPAC exit model or growth financing,  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:29):**  depending on how you want to look at it. It's not quite clear  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:32):**  how long that SPAC exit door is going to be open or not. But I  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:36):**  think fundamentally, we've just got to come up with different  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:40):**  models other than the standard 10-year venture capital fund  
**[0:29:44-0:29:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:44):**  that meet the needs. There are a lot of really good companies in  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:47):**  ag tech. They just may not meet the metrics of a standard VC  
**[0:29:53-0:29:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:53):**  fund. And so there's a lot of innovation and a lot of room for  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:56):**  growth. It's just, we need to find ways to fund those  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:30:00):**  companies. Matt, Sarah? Well, I mean, I think we touched on, it's  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:30:04):**  important for us to be positive and come forward with solutions.

**[0:30:10-0:30:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:30:10):**  because otherwise we wouldn't know what is more likely to

**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:30:15):**  what we're seeing now is this understanding of the importance

**[0:30:35-0:30:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:30:35):**  kind of idea of separating out the user from the beneficiary,

**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:30:42):**  it gets back to the point about the kind of innovation versus  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:30:45):**  the business model, right? The innovation probably is targeted

**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:42:12):**  really keeps me going into the space.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:42:14):**  Great. Matt?  
**[0:42:15-0:42:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:42:15):**  Yeah. I mean, I think the, yeah, like excited by all these  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:42:21):**  opportunities, our natural environment is now visible in a  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:42:26):**  way that it's never been before. And increasingly most

**[0:42:34-0:42:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:42:34):**  bigger, are increasingly interested in the relationship  
**[0:42:40-0:42:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:42:40):**  between what they're eating and the natural environment.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:42:42):**  And overwhelmingly the food that we create comes from the

**[0:42:51-0:42:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:42:51):**  very motivated to take care of the natural environment, but  
**[0:42:54-0:42:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:42:54):**  mostly because it sustained their family business, right?  
**[0:42:58-0:43:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:42:58):**  Not because they were worried about or wanting to engage with  
**[0:43:03-0:43:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:03):**  the people who could clearly see what they're doing.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:06):**  I worry that we're still partly in this posture of it's my

**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:15):**  actually can see what you're doing. And so leaning into that  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:19):**  and saying, come take a look, right? We're proud of being the  
**[0:43:23-0:43:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:23):**  custodians of the land. We're proud of being the people who  
**[0:43:27-0:43:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:27):**  grow the food that you will eat and we're, and we want to  
**[0:43:31-0:43:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:31):**  engage in this conversation, but it's got to be a two way  
**[0:43:33-0:43:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:33):**  conversation, right? And so I think that's the second part,  
**[0:43:36-0:43:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:36):**  which is the hugely exciting, again, potential that's been  
**[0:43:41-0:43:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:41):**  created by technology to see that the benefits of being a

**[0:43:51-0:43:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:51):**  asset there that you can pass on to your family, but that you  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:54):**  get recognised for those dual roles of being the people who  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:59):**  create the food and being the people who at the same time  
**[0:44:04-0:44:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:44:04):**  care for and enhance the natural environment, especially  
**[0:44:07-0:44:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:44:07):**  as we're moving into a version of the planet that's going to be  
**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:44:10):**  very different from the version that the current generation's

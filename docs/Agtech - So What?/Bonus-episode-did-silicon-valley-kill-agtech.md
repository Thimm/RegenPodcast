### Agtech - So What?  (2021-08-18)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Ag Tech So What, brought to you by the  Agthentic Group. I'm Kirsten Diprose here with a bonus  episode. So did Silicon Valley kill Ag Tech, or at least set it  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:00:15):**  back a decade? Ah yes, Silicon Valley, California. It's the  tech sector's equivalent to Hollywood, where entrepreneurs  see their dreams go boom or bust. It's seen as the birthplace  
**[0:00:28-0:00:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:00:28):**  of modern technology, quite literally taking its name from  the region sand, which contained the silicon used to manufacture  the first computer chips. Now Silicon Valley is synonymous  
**[0:00:40-0:00:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:00:40):**  with technology, rapid innovation, startups and venture  capital. It's the home of big tech companies like eBay,  PayPal, Facebook, Intel, Alphabet, and of course, Apple.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:00:52):**  People now even talk about the Silicon Valley innovation model  as a template for startup success. Yet when it's been  applied to Ag Tech, well, we've seen mixed results.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:01:03):**  So you may think that if I can just get the farmer to adopt my  tool, then it's game over, I'm going to go disrupt the system.  But you find that there's like multiple layers of that onion to  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:01:13):**  peel back before you can actually make change to that  system. And I think that's one of the big aha's that a lot of  folks have had.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:01:20):**  So we're peeling that onion. That was Rob Trice, the founder  of Better Food Ventures, a food and ag VC and founder of the  Mixing Bowl, which is connecting food, ag and tech innovators in  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:01:31):**  Silicon Valley and beyond. You'll also hear from Sarah  Nolette, who you probably already know, as well as Matthew  Pryor. They're both co founders of Tenacious Ventures and Agri  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:01:41):**  Food Tech VC and partners at the Agfenti Group. Both have strong  ties to Silicon Valley and recently published an article  with this very premise, how Silicon Valley set Ag Tech back  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:01:53):**  a decade. It struck a chord, it was a little tongue in cheek,  but it really started a conversation. So we thought we  dig in further. But first, let's meet Rob.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:05):**  Sure. So my name is Rob Trice. And I spent about just under 15  years in the mobile internet, telecom venture capital space. I  came here at the tail end of the.com bubble, I saw the burst.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:18):**  I was here for 9-11. I was here for 2008. When I started working  on the mobile internet, we were on 2G networks. It was that time  when people wondered why would I ever want a map or email on my  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:31):**  phone. And it was really exciting to see things like this  new technology called Wi-Fi really come to be in Silicon  Valley. But getting on with things around 2012, 13 or so I  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:43):**  just started to get tired. People are talking about 5G. And  in my mind, I just, I didn't have 5G in me. I've been going  to the same conferences, talking about the same topics for a  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:02:52):**  number of years. And at the same time, my wife started running  this regenerative cattle ranch behind us, 45 minutes West to  Silicon Valley out on the Pacific coast. And so I  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:03):**  literally was walking around this cattle ranch, trying to  figure out what I was going to do when I, you know, when I grew  up. And I was looking at the fact that you'd seen Uber  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:11):**  disrupt transportation, Airbnb disrupt lodging, and, um,  then saw a cowboy pulling an SD card out of a weather station,  look at these guys struggling to use square at the farmers  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:21):**  market, and realize that five to 10% of the world's economy is  ag food. And that Silicon Valley's innovation ecosystem  at that point had not yet grabbed on to food tech and ag  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:35):**  tech. And so I started two organizations, the mixing bowl  and better food ventures. The mixing bowl is a forum to  connect it food and ag innovators for thought and action  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:43):**  leadership and better food ventures makes investments  across the supply chain of food and ag in information technology  companies looking to make a positive impact.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:03:52):**  Great. Matt, is there some overlap in terms of your  timelines and when you were in Silicon Valley?  Yeah, probably I was co-founder of a software business in  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:02):**  Melbourne, the late eighties, early nineties. And my first  exposure to Silicon Valley was a subscription newsletter  business. And I literally mean I mailed out newsletter. It was  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:12):**  called Software Success. And it just was we would get it once a  month. And it was this amazing kind of missive about all this  mythical stuff that would happen in this place called Silicon  
**[0:04:21-0:04:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:21):**  Valley. So eventually, we decided that we needed to be  there and kind of moved what we call the HQ of our software  business, which was myself and one of my co-founders to San  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:31):**  Francisco. And it was interesting because kind of that  was mid nineties. And at that time, San Francisco was sort of  really on the cusp of Silicon Valley. It wasn't quite  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:38):**  considered part of Silicon Valley then. But we said that  we were there for about seven years as Silicon Valley just  expanded kind of north and the city became this incredibly  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:04:49):**  vibrant tech hub. It was an awesome time to be there. We  went kind of right through the absolute highs and the quite  serious lows of the original dot com era, I think is what we're  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:05:00):**  calling it now. But yeah, it was such a stark contrast to how I  had experienced kind of software. And like there was no  VC in Australia really at that time. So moving back in the kind  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:05:12):**  of mid-orts, it was interesting to sort of start to see that  appearing in Australia, but I suppose considerably behind. I  just through circumstance, kind of got invited into a project  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:05:26):**  that actually was trying to model pasture growth to estimate  stocking rates for cattle properties in the north of  Australia. And I just had this light bulb of interest that  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:05:37):**  was like, wow, all this stuff of software and this amazing  meaningful purpose of making sure that stocking rates were  kind of set at sustainably low but economically meaningful  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:05:49):**  rights and kind of that was my journey from tech into agtech.  And Sarah, what about you? You might have a different point of  you being Silicon Valley born and bred.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:05:59):**  Yeah, I guess I didn't see it as such a fairy tale land until I  left. So I was born in Silicon Valley and well, I was born in  San Diego, but I grew up in Silicon Valley. And both my  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:06:09):**  parents worked in the semiconductor industry. And I  didn't, I definitely didn't realize at the time how unique  that was. But you know, we'd have a Girl Scout fundraiser or  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:06:17):**  something and my mom would take me to her company and I'd get to  put on the bunny suit and go in and see the chip fabrication  equipment. And like that was just the world I grew up in and  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:06:25):**  had no idea that it was revolutionizing, you know, the  rest of the planet because I was, you know, 10 years old.  So it was it was a pretty different perspective on that.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:06:35):**  But I guess it kind of sticks with you. I mean, I remember  going to lots of business meetings with my dad who also  worked in the industry and you just go to a Starbucks or you  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:06:44):**  know, Pete's coffee or whatever around here and you kind of look  around and everyone's like pitching someone else and trying  to get a deal up and doing business and hatching an idea  
**[0:06:53-0:06:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:06:53):**  and there's notebooks and napkins and scraps. And so that  energy was just what I grew up in. And I didn't really realize  how special it was until I was 10.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:07:01):**  I didn't really realize how special it was until I left and  kind of looking back on it and seeing how much that  entrepreneurial spirit and that kind of tech vibe is so alive  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:07:09):**  here and really unique to other places in the world.  I guess now I want to move on to where agriculture fits in all of  this and where it has tried and failed in the past to digitize  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:07:20):**  or kind of change in Silicon Valley. Rob, what's what's your  experience of it?  I didn't know much about food or agriculture and I actually  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:07:32):**  started talking to some people who very quickly mentored me, if  you will, to tell me that, you know, as opposed to like the  social media investing that I have been doing, the tweeting  
**[0:07:41-0:07:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:07:41):**  and eating or food and agriculture is very different than  social media, right? And for a variety of reasons, you know,  all the reasons that we'll probably get into, but you know,  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:07:50):**  that the innovation cycle is slower. You get something wrong  with a social media app, you just do a software upgrade, you  get something wrong in food, you can kill people, right? So  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:08:00):**  like, there's a lot of the stakes are higher. So I  appreciated that I didn't know what I didn't know. I started  to learn that. And I think it was healthy for me to step in,  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:08:11):**  in the early stages of the space to recognize that you  couldn't just cut and paste the enterprise software model to  agriculture and then obviously, particularly agriculture and  
**[0:08:24-0:08:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:08:24):**  food to a lesser degree.  Rob, I'm curious when you were first looking at this space, and  one of the things I really respect and admire that you guys  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:08:30):**  have done is a lot of convening, like bring in the venture  capital, the corporate venture capital from the tech world to  talk to some farmers and some soil scientists, and you guys  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:08:38):**  have been doing that all along. But when you first started doing  it, like how awkward were those rooms to be in? Because those  were people that weren't interacting, I imagine, like they  
**[0:08:47-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:08:47):**  are today.  So we did this event called Food IT, arguably the very first  agri-food tech event in Silicon Valley. And I remember the  
**[0:08:57-0:08:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:08:57):**  first time that we did this, I don't know if you know Chris  Patterson, who's a BASF, big hulking, six foot five guy,  Canadian farmer, that sounds like the beginning of a bad  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:09:07):**  joke. And he walks up to me and he says, I got something to  say to you about this event. I'm like, Oh no, here it comes.  He knows I'm a fake and a fraud. And he says, I go to all  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:09:18):**  these ag tech events. And this is the best event that I've  been to in five years. He goes, and the reason is I'm talking  to chefs. I'm talking to people about food waste. He goes,  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:09:29):**  when we go to ag tech conferences, we just talk to other  farmers and so forth. Now I have the opportunity to actually  see across the value chain. So I was relieved by that. And  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:09:38):**  one of the things that I found recently from that very first  event was something that we call the stepping stones to  solving food and ag challenges, which is we laid out kind of a  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:09:50):**  purpose for the mixing bowl of seeing the issues, seeking  solutions, solving issues, and then scaling solutions. And if  you look at that, and I've written about this, my  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:10:02):**  frustration is that currently we're still spending too much  time seeing the issues and seeking solutions. We're not  solving the issues that we need to in a timely or scaled  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:10:12):**  fashion. That's a really interesting insight. I want to  kind of get an idea of what the VC playbook was like back in  Silicon Valley when ag tech first came on to the scene. And  
**[0:10:23-0:10:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:10:23):**  I know that Matt and Sarah, you've both written about this  in your article, how Silicon Valley set ag tech back a  decade. Could you give us an idea of how it worked back then?  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:10:33):**  And maybe it still works like this now. I mean, I think the  lived experience in San Francisco through that time, you  know, showed the good and the bad. I mean, my indelible  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:10:43):**  memory, like most people who've been to San Francisco know it's  very hilly. And my indelible memory is of a web van guy  schlepping groceries up the 35 steps to the front door of our  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:10:54):**  house. Like, web van was the first kind of deliver food to  your home kind of effort. It was typical Silicon Valley boots and  all like, they had their own fleet, they had their own  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:04):**  everything. They built this massive distribution center in  Oakland. I mean, it was like, I don't even know how many  hundreds of millions of dollars they set in a pile and burn.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:13):**  But I think there was the experience of just like, throw  enough money at it. And eventually you'll get the  formula right. And when you zoom out to 30,000 feet, that does  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:24):**  work. And now today, we can see how the, you know, whatever  started from web van and has become what it's become today  worked. But I think, yeah, actually, you know, back to  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:34):**  Rob's point about, it's different in food and ag,  because, well, in ag, you're dealing with people's livelihoods,  right? And so this idea of, oh, we'll just kind of try this  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:11:43):**  thing. And it may not work out for you, but it'll work out  fine for the people 10 years after you. Like, for the most  part, farmers can't and won't just take those kind of risks

And I think  that was kind of really where that point of difference really  started to show up for us really, like, I can put a whole  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:03):**  bunch of stuff on Facebook, and then maybe I delete it. And  like, yeah, it's not going to fundamentally change my bank  balance. But the decisions that farmers make on every day, a  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:12):**  basis, do, you know, fundamentally change their bank  balance. And so they can't be cavalier about, you know, what  little Silicon Valley experiment they want to be part of today  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:22):**  or tomorrow.  Sarah, what are your insights on this?  Oh, well, it actually goes to something Rob and I were talking  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:27):**  about earlier, where in some ways, like ag has been optimized  to remove risk, and venture capital was built to embrace risk.  And so there's this like, fundamental disconnect in the two  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:39):**  worlds. And that's where some of this clashes come because yeah,  we're like, Oh, farmers, you know, they iterate every season,  like a season's a long time. And the number of software  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:47):**  iterations you'd get over that 12 month period is much higher  than one. And then the next season comes around. And it's  different because you've got different rainfall and the soil  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:12:54):**  has changed and the markets are different. And so yes, there are  many similarities between farmers as entrepreneurs and  entrepreneurs in terms of mindset and owning businesses and  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:02):**  experimentation. But the systems are sort of optimized, almost  in the exact opposite direction in terms of risk. And so I think  that's where venture capital can butt heads or has butt heads  
**[0:13:11-0:13:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:11):**  with with ag.  So ridiculous asking this question, but because you're all  base days, but does this mean that ag tech doesn't fit with  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:20):**  venture capital?  Well, I'll chime in, I think there are limitations to the  application of the standard venture model to agriculture,  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:29):**  for exactly the point that Sarah is mentioning and what Sarah  and Matthew wrote about, which is, you know, if you think about  what Facebook, their whole motto was move fast and break things.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:41):**  Well, what if you can move fast, but you don't break things,  right? If you try to go disrupt the ag marketplace, but then you  hit a brick wall because you realize that there's an entire  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:13:51):**  system there to minimize risk, minimize disruption. And that's  not just the farmer, that's everything behind it all the way  to crop insurance. Right. And so you may think that if I can just  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:04):**  get the farmer to adopt my tool, then it's game over. I'm going  to go disrupt the system. But you find that there's like  multiple layers of that onion to peel back before you can  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:14):**  actually make change to that system. And I think that's one  of the big aha's that a lot of folks have had. So there are  certainly opportunities, but I think it's a smaller subset than  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:24):**  we might've thought about seven years ago. You know, a headline  always has to be brief. And so the risk in saying something  like how Silicon Valley killed ag tech is to imply that the  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:34):**  whole model doesn't work. And the more nuanced view is there  are key parts of it that are fundamental to the  transformation that agriculture has to make. And so the sort of  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:45):**  some of the key elements of the Silicon Valley model is driving  really hard on the transformative potential of  digital technology in particular, but let's just say  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:14:54):**  technological transformation. Like that is so true of  agriculture that, you know, when we've got satellites flying  over the entire world, couple of times a day at 30 centimeter  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:03):**  and below resolution with spectral depths and all that  kind of stuff, like we will know things about the in the  natural environment at very low cost at very high resolution  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:12):**  that we've never known before. And so that part of it is  absolutely true. The transformative potential in  technological innovation as applied to, you know, all kinds  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:23):**  of physical industries is amazing and it's inspiring. And  I think it what brings, you know, people like us together.  I think that the point we're trying to make is that bringing  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:33):**  those things together along with this kind of pre-canned  idea of this is how users take a delivery of technology. This  is how users benefit from technology. This is how you  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:44):**  monetize it. I think those are the bits, particularly in  agriculture where the template doesn't fit quite as well and  you have to kind of tease it apart and that's where we're  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:15:55):**  kind of getting to with that idea of the user different to  the beneficiary and really think in a more nuanced way  about the business models that are required because the tech  
**[0:16:05-0:16:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:16:05):**  part is fundamental. We have to have that transformative  capacity. We've just got to think differently about how to  make it stick. It's sort of exacerbated by how a lot of  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:16:14):**  entrepreneurs end up coming into the industry because if  they haven't come from seeing how the supply chain and those  incentives work, but they've come from the tech side or the  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:16:23):**  farm side, it sort of at first seems obvious like, oh, well,  this widget will save us this percent on our water bill or on  our diesel bill. And so like, obviously everyone should do  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:16:31):**  it, but you're sort of only looking at part of the picture  and missing the broader drivers. And so it's not for  lack of good intentions, like you go to these accelerator  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:16:38):**  programs and they say, go talk to farmers and you talk to  farmers, but you're only looking at this small part of the  system and you've missed the unlock codes of what can drive  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:16:45):**  adoption more broadly. Like the first wave we saw that was,  oh, let's sell direct to farmers. And then it was like,  oh, let's go through the channel or talk to service providers  
**[0:16:51-0:16:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:16:51):**  because they're the ones with the trusted advice. And so  that's worked in some cases and is part of understanding the  system, but you sort of zoom out again and see how much  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:17:01):**  potential there is in the supply chain and how much that  can drive adoption and really change the equation.  Sorry, I told Sarah, I won't sing it, but I keep thinking  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:17:09):**  when I read your piece, I kept thinking about this Dave Mason  song. I think it's called Disagree. And I won't sing it.  The lyrics are basically, I'm going to spare you, but there  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:17:22):**  ain't no good guy. There ain't no bad guy. There's just you  and me and we just disagree. And I look at venture capital.  I look at agriculture, neither of them are particularly bad.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:17:30):**  They're just not agreeable to each other in many instances.  And in defense of venture capital, the standard venture  model is a 10 year ish model looking from, you know,  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:17:42):**  alpha and, you know, multiples on money within a constrained  timeframe. If you've got that slower innovation cycle, you've  got that risk avoidance mindset. That's where that  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:17:55):**  incongruence actually occurs. And I don't think we have to  lay blame. It's the limitations of both systems. And you know,  what Sarah and I were talking about is the need for  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:18:05):**  alternative financing as well. Yeah. I love exactly.  Actually the biologicals pod with that quote from Jarrett,  which is logistics, Trump's technology in those three words  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:18:19):**  is so much understanding of the problem, right? Because the  reality is that if I've got to plant that whole field today,  it doesn't matter. Like if it's going to rain next week or  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:18:32):**  whatever, like you can be offering me the best tech, the  most sophisticated, whatever, if it's going to get in the way of  getting done, what needs to get done, you're just not even a  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:18:42):**  starter. And I think that kind of thing is an example of what  you're talking about. It's just like when those two worlds come  together, if you don't have that understanding, then whatever  
**[0:18:51-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:18:51):**  you're going to say next is just going to drop to the floor.  And there's a lot of money in that logistics as someone who  sees harvest every year. You're talking about the disconnect  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:19:01):**  between the VC world and the ag world. Some of those big ag  companies were placed or were they well placed, particularly  in the past to step in there, like the Monsanto's, some of  
**[0:19:12-0:19:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:19:12):**  those companies that had those early venture arms.  I mean, it's interesting how in preparation for the article, I  went back and read the original press release for the  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:19:21):**  announcement of the climate acquisition. And what they talk  about is weather insurance. And I had completely forgotten that  that was the business model way back then. And so I think yes  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:19:35):**  and no, in what that suite of products is now transformed into  is barely recognisable from what was publicly viewable back  then. Now, how much was in the can and how much of that was  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:19:48):**  important to the acquisition? It's hard to know. I'm sure  there are people who do know. But just that point of even in  the hands of the kind of larger incumbent multinationals, there  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:20:01):**  was a lot that wasn't known. I think the risk part of that  equation was, wow, if we stand to suffer the kind of disruption  that's happened in other industries, we need to make some  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:20:12):**  moves here. And the dollars are so big that big bets that had  some risk or at least risk of going to zero were worth  placing.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:20:21):**  Sarah?  Oh, I was just gonna say, like we kind of talked about it in  the article that what we've seen is those incumbents making  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:20:28):**  acquisitions or kind of getting in a space for probably two key  reasons. One is talent, like just acquiring a new skill set  that they haven't had in house, whether that's artificial  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:20:36):**  intelligence or machine learning or access to Silicon Valley or  programmers, just a different kind of talent, and the ability  to sort of protect and defend their existing revenue streams  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:20:46):**  and business models. And it's interesting because that has  made for acquisitions, and that's what the space wants. And  that's how returns happen and the kind of cycle unfolds. Yet  
**[0:20:55-0:20:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:20:55):**  some of the opportunity that people see in agriculture is to  kind of fully disrupt the system and have new incumbents or new  transformations to the whole model. And so that's been part  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:06):**  of the challenge, and that's what we allude to being possible  in the next wave in certain areas, but it's definitely not  without its challenges. That's just what we've seen so far.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:15):**  Yeah. And just to add to that, and Matthew and Sarah talk  about it, but so for instance, you had a climate purchase by  Monsanto Bayer, you had granular purchase by DuPont, and what  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:26):**  Cortiva and what you've actually seen there is now they're  giving that stuff away for free. So they did acquire it.  They're pushing it through their channel. That's going to  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:35):**  accelerate adoption because free is a pretty good price, but  that's also a category killer for everybody else in the space.  So to boil it down, as we see ag, I kind of see two paths.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:46):**  It's not that critical to think about, but it's evolutionary or  revolutionary. And most of the corporate VCs are probably  looking at the evolutionary path. There are some exceptions  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:21:57):**  though. I think about what Tyson did in terms of making the  investment in beyond me breaking out of the animal protein  sector for that company. Look at Driscoll's partnering with  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:09):**  plenty on indoor berry production. There's some other  examples out there where they're kind of sticking their toe in  the revolutionary path, which will be interesting to see.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:20):**  Again, I'm not trying to hear to defend Silicon Valley or  ag tech investing, but if you look at that evolutionary  versus revolutionary path, you look at how much wind VC money  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:33):**  has put into the revolutionary or alternative sales, whether  that is alternative proteins, alternative production, the  indoor greenhouse, vertical farming, that's benefited a lot.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:47):**  We'll see if it actually changes agriculture. We're still  trying to figure out the evolutionary versus revolutionary  path. They're going to coexist, but I think we have seen a  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:22:56):**  benefit by having that talent and that money come into the  space. Yeah. Andres and Horowitz, it's Alex Rample has an  interesting way of characterizing this, where they, he  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:07):**  refers to it kind of as a race where the startup is trying to  get distribution before the incumbent gets innovation. And  I think that that's, that is part of what drives that desire  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:17):**  to kind of place those bets. And, you know, Rob, you're  absolutely right that, you know, some of those are very brave  and kind of forward thinking bits, like, as you say, betting  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:26):**  on being disrupted. But I think the other side of that coin is  that a lot of the time, the Silicon Valley view is that it's  it's largely about software, like innovation equals software.

It's not getting any less  true. Like when we think we've been doing a bunch of small  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:46):**  group discussions over the past couple of weeks thinking about  sustainability and almost every, if not every sustainability  problem, it's yes, we need data. Yes, we need interoperability,  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:23:55):**  but then we need to go physically do something in the  world or change something. We need to like process the waste.  We need to make the biological, we need to turn on the pump.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:03):**  And so this idea that the software alone can be the  solution, yeah, maybe great economics, but if it doesn't  actually solve the problem, then then what are we really  
**[0:24:11-0:24:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:11):**  doing? And so that's bringing in a whole new layer of, I think,  Silicon Valley is evolving in this direction, too, of needing  to look at biology, needing to look at hardware, needing to  
**[0:24:20-0:24:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:20):**  look at deep tech, whatever you want to call it, to solve some  of these climate problems, especially, but in agriculture,  that's absolutely true. And it is a whole new skill set and  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:27):**  way of thinking about these investments.  Is there an example anyone could give of a, and I know  people don't want to throw a company under the bus, but in  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:35):**  the past of an early ag tech, or maybe not even early ag tech,  but, you know, startup that just made some of these mistakes  or even in an epic fail, if you've got a story like that,  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:46):**  what's the one that gets your 101 lesson on what not to do?  I'll share a war story. We had a company that shall remain  nameless and we seeded the deal and we had a very well  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:24:59):**  established Silicon Valley investor who came in and led a  substantial series a, and we were high-fiving each other  because we thought our work was done because it was now in  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:25:08):**  the hands of a much bigger fund with adult supervision.  And the reality was the company was, it had a little bit of  a delay, maybe one season, but the reality was it was doing  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:25:20):**  fine as an ag tech company. We had over 90% renewal of the  product. We had good channels stepping in, but for this  Silicon Valley investor, that growth wasn't fast enough.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:25:34):**  And so they kept trying to see what they could do to increase  the numbers to go up into the right, taking on new products,  bigger markets, all causing the CEO to have to do double back  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:25:48):**  flips that the company just wasn't built for. And so we  were a bit frustrated because we could see that this was a  good ag tech company and we're headed to the right, on the  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:25:59):**  right path for a good acquisition, but it wasn't happening  fast enough for that Silicon Valley investor. And it didn't  end well. And I'll stop there. I need to go find a Kleenex  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:26:10):**  now. We've seen it a few times with companies that we,  you know, that come to us for in the kind of raise process.  And they say, you know, they're almost apologetic about their  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:26:22):**  revenue numbers. And they're sort of like, look, we just, we  really wanted to get the product right. And we have these  partnerships and we're really working on them. But we know  
**[0:26:30-0:26:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:26:30):**  that like, you know, you and all the other VCs want us to have  have sold this product, you know, way more times. And it's  interesting because they come to us as an ag tech investor and  
**[0:26:37-0:26:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:26:37):**  we're able to say, well, no, it probably doesn't make sense to  have a bunch of hardware in a bunch of different places,  because like, how do you, you know, deploying a fixed all of  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:26:46):**  those and it's going to break. And like, you know, you don't  need that really early mass adoption because you're going  about this a different way. And that actually is gonna be way  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:26:54):**  worse for you. And they've just been told by so many VCs to get  those sales up at the expense of everything else. And then they  end up spending tons of money solving problems completely  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:27:03):**  unscalably because they got really bad advice or advice that  wasn't tailored to their model, especially if they have a  hardware component. Hey, if I can, I want to give a shout out  
**[0:27:11-0:27:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:27:11):**  to Ag authentic because Sarah, as you have probably heard me,  I cite your report that talked about the survey of incubators,  accelerators, and venture support. And the fact that we  
**[0:27:22-0:27:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:27:22):**  have over 150 globally for ag tech. And I think part of the  problem is that you might see a sexy IOT company and some  accelerator incubators, like this one's going to be  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:27:36):**  different, or they don't even know about the other 32 that  exist. And so they get behind that one and they get them in  to that cycle. So you have a lot of people that are running  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:27:46):**  incubators and accelerators who are feeding this to the VCs,  feeding this to the big companies. And there's a knock  on effect where you get the innovation fatigue. You get the  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:27:57):**  companies that are just stuck out in the valley of death. And  I think that's yet another symptom from that Silicon Valley  model that has been a bit problematic to be polite.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:28:12):**  And it's meant that people are frustrated exactly as you said.  I mean, you go talk to some of these corporates who've been  pitched by 70 of those 150 accelerators to sponsor their  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:28:20):**  programs. And they're like, but you're not bringing me anything  new or interested or connected to my model at all. And so,  yeah, I get that, you know, some nice PR or, you know, I might  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:28:28):**  meet some smart people, but like, you know, I'm not, I'm not  getting the results I need. And that's been tough because there  is good stuff out there. And, and, you know, maybe that model  
**[0:28:36-0:28:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:28:36):**  has been challenging in kind of serving it up on a platter in the  way that you maybe it wanted to. Yeah. I was actually talking to  a farming corporation the other day who have a system on how to  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:28:47):**  say no to ag tech. Like that's what they call it. And they use  ag tech on their farm and they like it, but they have a system  for how to say no. So that's really interesting. I wanted to  
**[0:28:56-0:28:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:28:56):**  move on to the solution. You all wouldn't be here in this  industry if you didn't think there was a solution. Ag tech 2.0,  what are we doing differently? What's the game changer, Rob, we  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:07):**  can start with you. Oh, thanks for the easy one. I think it's  interesting. So again, I cited before the limitations of the  venture capital model for ag tech. And I think that there's  
**[0:29:18-0:29:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:18):**  been a realization even by some of the people that are writing  really big checks. I'll tell you the parachute that everybody's  grabbing right now is the SPAC exit model or growth financing,  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:29):**  depending on how you want to look at it. It's not quite clear  how long that SPAC exit door is going to be open or not. But I  think fundamentally, we've just got to come up with different  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:40):**  models other than the standard 10-year venture capital fund  that meet the needs. There are a lot of really good companies in  ag tech. They just may not meet the metrics of a standard VC  
**[0:29:53-0:29:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:29:53):**  fund. And so there's a lot of innovation and a lot of room for  growth. It's just, we need to find ways to fund those  companies. Matt, Sarah? Well, I mean, I think we touched on, it's  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:30:04):**  important for us to be positive and come forward with solutions.  This isn't about rock throwing it at stuff that hasn't worked  because otherwise we wouldn't know what is more likely to  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:30:12):**  work. But I think, you know, what's really exciting about  what we're seeing now is this understanding of the importance  of looking upstream and downstream from where you are in  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:30:25):**  the supply chain and really understanding how value kind of  accretes and therefore, who are the, you know, we created that  kind of idea of separating out the user from the beneficiary,  
**[0:30:38-0:30:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:30:38):**  right? And so by understanding the difference, actually, maybe  it gets back to the point about the kind of innovation versus  the business model, right? The innovation probably is targeted  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:30:48):**  more at the user, but the business model has to be  targeted at the beneficiary because otherwise it doesn't  have any prospect of self-sufficiency. I think what we  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:30:58):**  are looking for as an investor is that level of understanding  and insight in putting as much thought into solving the  business model as whatever innovation kind of creates the  
**[0:31:09-0:31:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:31:09):**  opportunity in the first place. This doesn't go to necessarily  Silicon Valley business models, but one of the other things  that's changing and has definitely changed the  
**[0:31:17-0:31:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:31:17):**  conversations with corporates investing in this space and  thinking about outsource R&D is the climate pressures they're  facing and the sustainability related commitment pressures  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:31:26):**  that they're facing. The world where kind of corporate  sustainable social responsibility sits in a room and  has really no budget but writes some nice reports is  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:31:34):**  increasingly not the world we live in. It's integrated with  strategy. It's thinking about sourcing. It's thinking about  business models. It's thinking about venture and so the kind  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:31:42):**  of muscle that's going into enabling technologies that are  helping with the transition to lower chemical intensity or  combined biological and synthetic products or  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:31:51):**  automation or alternative proteins. It's just so much  more of a industry knowledge that hasn't maybe come to bear  because it's been left to Silicon Valley is showing up to  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:31:59):**  this party and requiring solutions and getting involved  in creating them. And I think if we're talking about  solutions, then you know, maybe we can sort of separate out  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:32:07):**  what we had more focused on was what startups need to do but  actually Rob's call out there is also what is venture need to  do, right? Think about the model differently, structure  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:32:17):**  yourself differently, look at evergreen kind of structures,  things that are more aligned to the period of time. It's  probably going to take these companies to really make their  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:32:27):**  business model stick and I think that those are two separate but  both really important things to point out. So, I won't take off  my shirt but I've got war wounds from my mobile days where  
**[0:32:37-0:32:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:32:37):**  basically I invested in a company that did Facebook live  before Facebook really existed and it was cool. It was  fantastic but trying to do audio video on a Nokia N95 to  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:32:52):**  port to the Symbian operating system for $70,000 to get your  billing done by AT&T and an alphanumeric keyboard was a  pain, right? Then this company Apple comes out with this  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:33:06):**  iPhone and it's not really like it can't withstand a finished  winter. It doesn't have a four-day battery life but it's  really good for the internet and it comes with an ecosystem  
**[0:33:18-0:33:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:33:18):**  that you can get your app approved easily and quickly. You  can get payments, you can leverage the GPS on the phone  really easily. All of that stuff made it super easy and my  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:33:28):**  point is two things. One, we need those ecosystems, right?  Those platforms in agriculture. Whether that's a John Deere  Op Center, I'm really excited to see actually what Telus and  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:33:39):**  Rabobank do with Conservice because now you might actually  have a way to get into farm management information systems  and if we can get those kind of things, that might be the kind  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:33:48):**  of thing that can change agriculture and make those  digital solutions better. As Matt and Sarah know, I am all  about the need for interoperable data in agriculture and if we  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:34:00):**  actually do want the food companies to pay farmers, they've  got to be able to get that data, that tracking and  transparency, whether that's paying for carbon credits, we  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:34:10):**  got to have that data flow along the value chain and I  think that's something that we need to recognize. I'll just  finish with my colleague Shauna Day talks about the staircase  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:34:21):**  of food and ag tech adoption where we need to crawl before we  walk, before we run, and before we can just throw robots out in  the field, we need to digitize information, we need to measure,  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:34:32):**  manage, optimize, and then we can automate. And the same  thing here, if you look, the biggest barrier that we have to  digitizing ag right now is the farmer's notebook because  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:34:42):**  they're all walking around with a little pocket book. No one's  getting the benefit of all the thoughts and the data that is in  that little book and so we need to get that digitized. So,  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:34:51):**  like, that's the basic crawling that we still need to do in  agriculture before we can unleash all the other things  we're talking about. Yeah, great, great example. Actually,  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:35:00):**  shout out to Ollie Magid and the group doing the thing called  Collabriculture which is quite targeted but it's an open developed  vine row model. So, to your point, you know, if you want

**[0:35:41-0:35:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:35:41):**  hitting the wall at high speed and then, you know, now what do  we do? And so they're kind of leaning in and saying, we're  going to create this infrastructure and then you can  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:35:51):**  build your systems around the ecosystem that we've created as  an industry. I'm curious if we can jump in with a quick story.  I was talking to a Southern US cotton farmer who was using an  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:36:03):**  Australian ag tech tool and she had furrowed her field and so  she was looking to capture that information in this tool, say I  furrowed field number 45. Well, she couldn't find that activity  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:36:17):**  in this because the Aussies call furrowing a light tickle of a  field. And so we don't even have the Australian and  English, American English are using different terms. So how do  
**[0:36:29-0:36:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:36:29):**  you expect a computer to be able to use that? And so how can we  standardize on one of those two terms? I do like light tickle,  but it usually means something else to me.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:36:41):**  I like that. That's great. And I really enjoyed your story  about the farmer using the handbooks. I can attest on our  farm. I'm very much trying to incorporate Agri web into the  
**[0:36:52-0:36:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:36:52):**  business and using software and my husband won't let go of his  clipboard. And so then there's this process where he just  hands me the clipboard and then I have to do data entry and it  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:37:00):**  sort of defeats the purpose because of the time. It's just  not worth anyone's time doing that. And I guess that whole  point goes to changing users behavior and how do you do that?  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:37:12):**  And the other one I think we haven't touched on is the supply  chain. There seems to be focused more on the beneficiaries in  the supply chain. Sarah, would you be able to touch on that?  
**[0:37:23-0:37:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:37:23):**  Yeah, we talked about it a little bit in terms of the kind  of threat that many of the food corporations, processing  companies, input companies are facing and for them to be able  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:37:31):**  to make claims about the scope two, scope three emissions that  they need to offset. They need to know what's going on on farm,  which also helps them manage risk in the supply chains and  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:37:41):**  think about procurement decisions and quality and all  the information they need, but they just don't have it right  now. And so when you think about those companies and the  
**[0:37:49-0:37:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:37:49):**  pressures they're under as the incentive to get those programs  and those technologies in the hands of the farmers, then it  really changes the equation because they have that really  
**[0:37:59-0:38:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:37:59):**  strong incentive. And so whether it's they subsidize the cost or  they create programs or they create incentives around  premiums or market access or tiered programs, whatever it is  
**[0:38:08-0:38:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:38:08):**  to help cover that kind of delta between what the benefits  are that the farmer is getting and the actual benefit that's  being realized. That doesn't work without data interoperability.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:38:18):**  So we don't want a bunch of different systems that still  can't talk to each other. We'll solve a bunch of problems. But  when we look to the pressures in the supply chain, they often  
**[0:38:26-0:38:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:38:26):**  are the ones upstream or downstream of the farmers that  have a much stronger incentive and can help solve some of this  adoption conundrum. Yeah. I mean, when the meat processor in  
**[0:38:35-0:38:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:38:35):**  Warrnambool is offering 3% price premium on the grid prices for  lamb, so long as you can provide the data, then you've got a  reason to enter the data, right? Right now, I wouldn't say it's  
**[0:38:48-0:38:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:38:48):**  a software problem. It's an incentive problem. Like it's,  you know, there'll be degrees to which one piece of software is  easier to use than another, but that's market, right? Like the  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:38:58):**  market will solve that problem. The real problem is there's no  really good reason to take the time to enter the data into the  software. I wanted to end with asking everyone a kind of big  
**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:39:09):**  picture question because, you know, you're here talking as  investors, talking as people who work with startups. So  obviously, there are reasons why you want to see agriculture  
**[0:39:21-0:39:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:39:21):**  digitize, why you want it to become digitally native, but why  is it important overall? Why should farmers care? Why should  farmers who are quite happy doing what they're doing change  
**[0:39:31-0:39:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:39:31):**  what they're doing? Why does the food system need to become  digitized? So I think there's really two big drivers here.  One is the absolute threat that we face from climate change and  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:39:43):**  just the ability to do what we have done in the past. It's  increasingly obvious that that just won't work anymore. I mean,  yields are plateauing, we've got resistance problems, we're  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:39:53):**  running out of topsoil, we're running out of water. Like,  there's all kinds of reasons why the kind of status quo isn't  going to work. And so we need new solutions. And we've seen  
**[0:40:01-0:40:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:40:01):**  that in Australia. And that's why the Australian farmers have  been innovative. And we've developed a lot of technology  down under. The other one would be, there are on an even larger  
**[0:40:10-0:40:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:40:10):**  scale, just existential climate threats that we face. And  agriculture is in this kind of pivotal moment of, is it going  to be the villain? Or is it going to be part of the  
**[0:40:18-0:40:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:40:18):**  solution? And why should farmers care? Well, absolutely, to be  part of the solution, whether that's through nature-based  solutions, through how land is managed, through how food is  
**[0:40:28-0:40:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:40:28):**  grown, and how they participate in the supply chain, there's an  absolute opportunity to be part of the hero of the story,  instead of part of the villain of the story. And if it doesn't  
**[0:40:36-0:40:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:40:36):**  change, I think there's a world where we say, well, let's just  grow this stuff in a lab, let's corporatize how land is owned.  There's a future that doesn't look very good for, I think, a  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:40:45):**  kind of rural agrarian picture and diversified land management  and absolute opportunities to live and manage farmland. And so  there's a both an imperative and an opportunity that I see.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:40:57):**  I think from my perspective, the more I dig into the space, the  more intrigued I get. And I think there are a number of, I  call them the WOWs, that just really stunned me. One, just  
**[0:41:09-0:41:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:41:09):**  stepping into the space. I thought we had, coming from the  outside, I thought we had a much deeper understanding of soil  than we actually did. Soil keeps civilization alive. Two, I  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:41:22):**  recognize now that we have a medical industry that does not  understand food as thy medicine. The average doctor in the U.S.  only gets 12 hours of nutritional training. Nurses get  
**[0:41:33-0:41:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:41:33):**  even less. Three, we don't really understand, let's call it  nutrition, personalized nutrition. If we were all to eat  a Twinkie, what the impact would be on our bodies, we don't  
**[0:41:47-0:41:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:41:47):**  really understand that all too well. Fourth, we don't really  understand how to get consumers not to eat the cheapest and  most convenient foods. And then the last one, which is  
**[0:41:58-0:42:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:41:58):**  something that Matt and Sarah talked about is, I'm amazed at  how little digital connection there is between the farm and  the fork. And so I look at those five big challenges as like,  
**[0:42:09-0:42:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:42:09):**  we got to figure these things out. And that's what I think  really keeps me going into the space.  Great. Matt?  
**[0:42:15-0:42:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:42:15):**  Yeah. I mean, I think the, yeah, like excited by all these  opportunities, our natural environment is now visible in a  way that it's never been before. And increasingly most  
**[0:42:31-0:42:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:42:31):**  enlightened consumers, and yeah, we want that number to be  bigger, are increasingly interested in the relationship  between what they're eating and the natural environment.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:42:42):**  And overwhelmingly the food that we create comes from the  natural environment. And historically farmers have been  very motivated to take care of the natural environment, but  
**[0:42:54-0:42:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:42:54):**  mostly because it sustained their family business, right?  Not because they were worried about or wanting to engage with  the people who could clearly see what they're doing.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:06):**  I worry that we're still partly in this posture of it's my  farm, I can do what I want versus, you know, everybody  actually can see what you're doing. And so leaning into that  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:19):**  and saying, come take a look, right? We're proud of being the  custodians of the land. We're proud of being the people who  grow the food that you will eat and we're, and we want to  
**[0:43:31-0:43:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:31):**  engage in this conversation, but it's got to be a two way  conversation, right? And so I think that's the second part,  which is the hugely exciting, again, potential that's been  
**[0:43:41-0:43:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:41):**  created by technology to see that the benefits of being a  visibly good custodian of the land don't just mean there's an  asset there that you can pass on to your family, but that you  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:43:54):**  get recognised for those dual roles of being the people who  create the food and being the people who at the same time  care for and enhance the natural environment, especially  
**[0:44:07-0:44:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:44:07):**  as we're moving into a version of the planet that's going to be  very different from the version that the current generation's  parents kind of grew up on.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/17/did-silicon-valley-kill-agtech#t=0:44:16):**  And that's it for our bonus episode of Ag Tech So What.

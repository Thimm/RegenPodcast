**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:00:41):**  If you do wet soil tests, they tend to be a lot more accurate.

**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:01:06):**  That's Adam Liedl, who has spent much of his career scaling AgTech.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:01:10):**  Adam was formerly at Granular, a farm management software company acquired by DuPont for $300  
**[0:01:15-0:01:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:01:15):**  million back in 2017.

**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:01:41):**  I grew up in Michigan, so Midwest guy at heart.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:01:43):**  I have been in California, San Francisco area for the last decade or so though.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:01:50):**  And career-wise, that's relevant because I really love the innovation side that happens  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:01:56):**  out here in California, but I also am more interested in some of the physical areas of  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:01):**  our world and growing food and things that happen in the Midwest, as well as culturally  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:06):**  kind of what both those places, the combination of them represent.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:09):**  So I'm not kind of a traditional farm kid, so I don't have that cred, but my grandmother  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:13):**  grew up in a farm, as many did in Ontario, Canada actually.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:17):**  And I was more interested initially in the clean tech and sustainability side of things.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:24):**  Climate change was always of interest to me because it's so existential to the planet  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:28):**  and affecting everybody.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:29):**  I also really liked the scientific aspect of biology and what we can do with genetics.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:34):**  So that was more from like a learning and passion perspective.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:37):**  And then when I came out of grad school, I did a JD MBA at University of Michigan and  
**[0:02:41-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:41):**  was trying to figure out what I wanted to do.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:43):**  I did a short stint as an investment banker in healthcare, the biotech angle, and it was  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:48):**  really to learn, pay back some of my loans.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:50):**  I knew it wouldn't be a long-term gig, but I learned a ton after a couple of years of  
**[0:02:54-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:54):**  doing mergers and acquisitions and financing.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:56):**  I more went into my passion, which was again, sustainability with this company called Cadexis.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:03):**  They worked on next generation ethanol and chemicals.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:07):**  And then when the bottom fell out of that space, because oil dropped from 200 bucks  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:10):**  a barrel to 40, a lot of the money went into agriculture because there was that opportunity  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:16):**  on the clean tech side.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:17):**  And I went with it.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:18):**  I was really excited at meeting this early team at a company called Solon that worked  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:23):**  on advanced soil science and basically more accurate soil tests that would lead to better  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:28):**  fertilizer application for people planning and farmers.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:31):**  We could not scale that.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:33):**  Unfortunately, I joined as director of BizDev to scale the company, but two months later  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:36):**  we ended up spinning that off to Climate Corp because the business model was incredibly  
**[0:03:41-0:03:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:41):**  difficult.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:42):**  And then we took that and we raised from similar VCs to found Granular.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:47):**  So at that point, Granular was only five people.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:50):**  There were five of us who kind of restarted it and created a early farm management software  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:57):**  analytics company.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:58):**  And so I had five or six different roles, had a ton of fun on the product and commercial  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:01):**  side.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:02):**  And then when we were acquired by Corteva in 2017, ended up as the chief revenue officer  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:07):**  for the digital business at Corteva.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:09):**  Spent two and a half years there, really learned a lot, but I'm more of a startup guy at heart.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:13):**  So I joined Sanad Agriculture a little less than two years ago as CEO.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:19):**  I think you said that piqued my interest was on Solon, that the kind of business model  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:22):**  maybe didn't have the scalability that you initially thought it might.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:26):**  Tell me a little bit more about that.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:29):**  So it was founded by a few Stanford physics PhDs, incredibly smart folks who created the  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:36):**  most advanced soil lab, probably in the world in Ames, Iowa.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:39):**  It looks like a clean lab that you would use for, for human therapeutics research.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:43):**  And it got you much more accurate soil tests.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:47):**  Most soil tests are about 20 to 30% inaccurate because of how it's done, the way they dry  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:52):**  soil.

**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:05:19):**  for land grants, long story short, not much.

**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:05:27):**  but we didn't see how it was going to lead to the type of returns that investors were

**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:05:45):**  I had joined with the idea that I would help scale this business.

**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:03):**  was a co-founder of OpenTable and been around the block and was very, very good.

**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:11):**  before me of discovering the path.

**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:18):**  as well.

**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:21):**  It's almost always like, did you talk to your end customers enough?  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:26):**  Did you talk to your partners enough and ask the direct questions of what you would pay  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:30):**  for XYZ, how this would work?  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:33):**  Too often, folks fall in love with their technology and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid of what  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:36):**  could be.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:37):**  And if you really get out there and stress test, you will almost always figure that out,  
**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:43):**  at least as to where is the product market fit today.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:45):**  So I think it's personal to like, oh, shoot, am I going to lose my job?  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:49):**  And are we going to let these employees down and the investors and everything else?  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:54):**  Luckily, the team to the credit of the founders had developed this really cool analytics software  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:59):**  that was the kernel of granular and farm management software.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:03):**  So because of that diversification into not only a physical soil lab, but also some software  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:08):**  analytics, we could say, well, we think this is going to be more of that thing and scalable.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:14):**  And we could broaden this out into business software that helps growers make decisions  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:18):**  and make their lives easier, which was the thesis of granular as a SaaS company for growers.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:24):**  And since we still had something, we could pivot.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:27):**  And then we pivoted and luckily we were able to find a good home for the solo employees  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:32):**  in the lab with climate and get some capital for that new thing.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:35):**  So that all took about, I'd say, three to six months.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:39):**  So it was relatively quick.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:40):**  And there were lots of days and nights where I was up in the middle of the night thinking,  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:43):**  will this work?  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:44):**  And it luckily did, but a lot of it was luck.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:48):**  There are some great lessons in Adam's story of pivoting.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:51):**  The science was there, tech was there, but the business model was lacking.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:55):**  So how did this major directional change go down with their investors?  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:59):**  The downside is and was that they didn't know much about agriculture.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:03):**  And it was an area that was completely new to them.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:05):**  What they did and what we did to a certain extent is you try to apply analogs.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:09):**  So they've seen a lot and they say, well, if it's worked in food or restaurants, would  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:15):**  it work here?  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:16):**  If it's worked in construction, would it work there?  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:18):**  So sometimes you get lucky and that's right.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:20):**  Other times you hit an industry that's so esoteric.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:22):**  And I argue agriculture is this, where you've got aspects of weather and agronomy and people  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:28):**  and machines.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:30):**  And it's an ecosystem that's so complex that it's harder to go in and do an Uber or a Lyft.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:37):**  But ultimately it was good we were able to push back and find another route.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:43):**  And ultimately they were supportive from that.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:44):**  You have to make sure not just to be like, oh, there's awesome investors involved.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:49):**  They made money here, so they must know what they're talking about.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:51):**  Not always true.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:52):**  They would admit that too, right?  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:54):**  They know they're not operators and they defer to the folks who are closer if you hire a  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:58):**  good people.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:59):**  Yeah, 100 percent, hopefully, at least in qualifying investors and finding that right  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:09:03):**  partnership makes a ton of sense.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:09:04):**  So in that granular journey, I think some of the commentary as the space has moved on  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:09:09):**  over the last five or so years is, can SaaS sort of work in agriculture?  
**[0:09:15-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:09:15):**  So I am a couple of years away from it now, but I think the typical SaaS model of someone  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:09:23):**  paying X dollars per year for pure software is really tough in agriculture.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:09:30):**  I think there is very much product market fit among certain types of producers, but

**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:16:23):**  his leadership style.

**[0:17:18-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:17:18):**  New CEO.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:17:19):**  So you're head's spinning, right?  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:17:20):**  And I've never met the CEO in person, only over Zoom.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:17:23):**  So there's zero trust established at that point because you have to have shared experience  
**[0:17:27-0:17:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:17:27):**  to create trust.

**[0:17:31-0:17:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:17:31):**  And I'm like nervous about proving myself.

**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:17:42):**  on listening, but at the same time challenged the team.

**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:17:53):**  And so now we're above all the benchmarks.

**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:18:05):**  And I'm thankful for the team, for the patients and us getting through it.

**[0:18:20-0:18:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:18:20):**  I've hired people that worked for me for six months before I met them.

**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:18:25):**  And so we just had to figure out if we could build trust or not, but that's not what you'd

**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:19:54):**  It was amazing.

**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:20:51):**  to reduce their fertilizer use.

**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:21:04):**  Well, at core, it is very similar to what some of the larger Ag companies have done  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:21:09):**  with biology plus chemistry.

**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:21:15):**  Instead of trying to do that with more artificial means, which I would argue GMOs are and synthetic

**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:21:40):**  You can replace 25 to 50 pounds of nitrogen, which is up to about a third of what farmers

**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:22:01):**  solution for this time and place.

**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:22:09):**  And then the second part is earlier to give it as like a series a company within the broader

**[0:22:26-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:22:26):**  are expressed to augment things like taste and shelf life and nutrient profiles.

**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:22:37):**  And while it's early days, we really think that could replace how plants are bred.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:22:42):**  And the big advantage is you can do it much faster.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:22:43):**  So we can do all that because it's tuning in a matter of months instead of the typical  
**[0:22:48-0:22:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:22:48):**  seven to 10 years it takes to create a new plant.

**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:22:54):**  Like do you own the platform that does the tuning?  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:22:58):**  Is there a change to the actual seed that then you can patent in terms of its changes?  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:04):**  Like what, how does the, what's IP or kind of defensibility landscape look like there?  
**[0:23:09-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:09):**  It's both.

**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:14):**  So think of it like CRISPR, but in our view, it's the next generation of CRISPR.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:19):**  So it's a platform technology that can be used on any plant to go in and soak seeds.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:27):**  You can also graph, but, but usually we're soaking seeds in a solution of targeted oligonucleotides.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:32):**  And then we've patented this pathway in the cell that takes them up naturally.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:37):**  It's a natural plant pathway that already exists.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:38):**  And when the seed is germinating, it takes up these target nucleotides.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:42):**  They then methyl, it's called methylate the DNA.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:45):**  So they, they change the expression through a methylation pattern.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:49):**  And then, then you see the effects then, and we've just done this with, with tomato crop,  
**[0:23:54-0:23:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:54):**  actually.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:55):**  You can patent the seeds and the crops that come out of it because those traits are heritable  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:00):**  year to year to year.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:02):**  So that, that was, that was really cool.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:04):**  This happens naturally like humans have epigenetic effects, plant have epigenetic effect.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:08):**  The whole idea is if you see an environmental stimulus, you will, your body, your biology  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:14):**  will change in terms of gene expression.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:17):**  It'll tune itself to evolve that environment.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:20):**  And in some cases, and usually that's knocked out, meaning that it's temporary because then  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:24):**  the environment changed back, changes back.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:26):**  But in some cases, there's this fascinating example where in world war II in the Netherlands,  
**[0:24:30-0:24:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:30):**  people were starving and their genes and their phenotype, they actually were tuned to absorb  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:37):**  and hold on to more calories as opposed to how their typical metabolism would work.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:42):**  And so when they came back to abundant food, they, they gained weight really easily.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:46):**  It was harder to take it off.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:48):**  That effect actually lasted to their kids.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:51):**  So they saw that in the next generation.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:53):**  So it was actually heritable, even though it was an epigenetic effect, which is fascinating  
**[0:24:57-0:24:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:57):**  to me in terms of this forefront of biology.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:59):**  And then eventually it petered out through the generations.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:02):**  Now if you tune the genes in a, in a purposeful way through our process, it's been found that  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:08):**  we could, we could make it so there are more or less sticky.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:11):**  So you can envision something that tunes itself out over generations or keeps on year after  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:15):**  year after year, which if you're working in seeds and agriculture, you generally want  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:19):**  it to be sticky for production and economic reasons.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:23):**  So we've talked about biologicals on the podcast.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:25):**  I know the SORC product isn't technically a biological, it's sort of got a biochemical  
**[0:25:29-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:29):**  approach in terms of the product.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:31):**  And from a channel perspective, you guys are selling through sort of traditional channels,  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:36):**  albeit smaller ones.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:37):**  Tell me a little bit about the business model for that first product.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:40):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:41):**  So to start off on the product, it is a chemistry product.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:46):**  So it comes in a jug, it comes in a gallon jug and it's a liquid suspension.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:51):**  So it looks and feels very much like a crop production product that farmers and retailers  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:55):**  are used to.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:56):**  And it's shelf stable for a similar period of time, a couple of years, which is a big  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:00):**  advantage versus microbes, where you have to be very purposeful and think about the  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:04):**  cold storage chain because they're live microorganisms.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:08):**  And once you open them up, you've got about 24 hours usually to apply them, which it's  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:12):**  not always easy if you get rained out and your planter sits there overnight because  
**[0:26:16-0:26:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:16):**  it's a chemistry, it's less material and less subject to different variables in the soil.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:23):**  The soil already has billions of microbes in it, and they already fix nitrogen and already  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:30):**  solubilize phosphorus and already break down micronutrients for the plant.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:34):**  That's the natural ecosystem that has existed for millennia.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:38):**  By the way, I'm a fan of microbes because I think that also has a solution, but you  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:42):**  don't necessarily need them if you can stimulate what's already in the soil.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:46):**  So ours gets added to the tank of a sprayer and it's a very small application, right?  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:52):**  It's about an ounce per acre.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:54):**  And then it goes across the field, they spray it with whatever else they're doing, fungicide,  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:58):**  herbicide, pesticide, and it gets a free ride.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:27:02):**  So it's zero additional causes, zero additional friction to the grower, and it just sits on  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:27:05):**  their shelf without any expertise to add.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:27:08):**  Then it stimulates those microbes already in the soil to fix and solubilize phosphorus.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:27:13):**  And so as a result, we see effects in not just corn, which we launched source corn in  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:27:18):**  early 2020, but also soybeans, which we launched in earlier this year.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:27:24):**  And then we're also testing wheat, canola, cotton, a lot of other aspects because those  
**[0:27:28-0:27:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:27:28):**  two macronutrients N and P are the most important because the volume is so small.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:27:35):**  We can go direct to grower as well as sell through independent dealers in addition to

**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:27:44):**  thing that's being distributed and that's hard for companies, we don't have that challenge.

**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:29:30):**  Tell me a little bit more about what that feels like.

**[0:29:43-0:29:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:29:43):**  I think they're actually making a lot of nuanced and sometimes imperceptible calculations and  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:29:50):**  analysis in their own head.

**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:29:58):**  It's one experience of having seen things in ag tech now a few times in different aspects

**[0:31:28-0:31:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:31:28):**  Mark, in recent was right when he said software is eating the world.

**[0:31:32-0:31:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:31:32):**  You also do physical stuff.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:31:33):**  So the reality is all companies will be a mix of tech and physical in the future.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:31:38):**  And we're, we're doing exactly that.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:31:42):**  So whereas most of it is straight inputs, we also have some algorithms and, and, and  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:31:47):**  data science work because that drastically speeds up things on the plant breeding side,  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:31:52):**  you need models and bioinformatics in order to know exactly where to target on the genome.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:31:57):**  And that's a core data science on the source side for any input, including ours and by  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:32:03):**  biologicals and whatever seeds, they don't work the same on every acre.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:32:07):**  And so what we've launched is we've already done this and we need to improve it, but we've  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:32:11):**  launched a thing called performance optimizer, which you can go on our website and you can  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:32:14):**  put in your pH, your organic matter and your cation exchange capacity.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:32:19):**  And it'll spit out.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:32:20):**  If we think you're going to have an excellent response, a good response or a poor response.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:32:25):**  So we actually call ourselves out when we're like, do not put source on this acre.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:32:28):**  So for us, that's a more authentic higher chances of success approach using data science  
**[0:32:34-0:32:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:32:34):**  and physical.

**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:32:38):**  It's just tough because of all the models and the variables.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:32:40):**  And so what helps for us is, is that approach back to your investor question.

### Agtech - So What?  (2022-01-12)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to 2022!  I'm Sarah Nolet, back for another year of AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agtentik  Group.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:00:10):**  Today, we're looking at the lifeblood of our entire food system â€” soil.  In some, the word conjures up an emotional response.  For others, it's, well, boring.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:00:20):**  For scientists and data analysts in AgTech, it's a rapidly evolving field, as we continue  to uncover the role of things like microbes in plant nutrition.  But soil is also big business, and there's nothing like the high price of fertilizer  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:00:33):**  right now to remind us of that.  So how can science and technology best combine with the business of soil?  If you do wet soil tests, they tend to be a lot more accurate.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:00:45):**  But the problem was, even though you could link it too well, maybe we're overplaying  fertilizer, the link to who really cares about that and who will pay for that, given the  low cost of soil tests, and what happens with ag retailers and farmers in terms of the incentives.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:01:02):**  Long story short, not much.  That's Adam Liedl, who has spent much of his career scaling AgTech.  Adam was formerly at Granular, a farm management software company acquired by DuPont for $300  
**[0:01:15-0:01:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:01:15):**  million back in 2017.  DuPont later then merged with Dow to become what is now Corteva.  Adam is now the CEO of Sound Agriculture, a crop inputs startup that's raised just  
**[0:01:27-0:01:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:01:27):**  over $95 million.  One of their main products is targeted at activating the microbes in soil to increase  nitrogen and phosphorus uptake.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:01:35):**  But before all of that, Adam's AgTech journey began in the Midwest.  I grew up in Michigan, so Midwest guy at heart.  I have been in California, San Francisco area for the last decade or so though.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:01:50):**  And career-wise, that's relevant because I really love the innovation side that happens  out here in California, but I also am more interested in some of the physical areas of  our world and growing food and things that happen in the Midwest, as well as culturally  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:06):**  kind of what both those places, the combination of them represent.  So I'm not kind of a traditional farm kid, so I don't have that cred, but my grandmother  grew up in a farm, as many did in Ontario, Canada actually.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:17):**  And I was more interested initially in the clean tech and sustainability side of things.  Climate change was always of interest to me because it's so existential to the planet  and affecting everybody.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:29):**  I also really liked the scientific aspect of biology and what we can do with genetics.  So that was more from like a learning and passion perspective.  And then when I came out of grad school, I did a JD MBA at University of Michigan and  
**[0:02:41-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:41):**  was trying to figure out what I wanted to do.  I did a short stint as an investment banker in healthcare, the biotech angle, and it was  really to learn, pay back some of my loans.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:02:50):**  I knew it wouldn't be a long-term gig, but I learned a ton after a couple of years of  doing mergers and acquisitions and financing.  I more went into my passion, which was again, sustainability with this company called Cadexis.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:03):**  They worked on next generation ethanol and chemicals.  And then when the bottom fell out of that space, because oil dropped from 200 bucks  a barrel to 40, a lot of the money went into agriculture because there was that opportunity  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:16):**  on the clean tech side.  And I went with it.  I was really excited at meeting this early team at a company called Solon that worked  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:23):**  on advanced soil science and basically more accurate soil tests that would lead to better  fertilizer application for people planning and farmers.  We could not scale that.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:33):**  Unfortunately, I joined as director of BizDev to scale the company, but two months later  we ended up spinning that off to Climate Corp because the business model was incredibly  difficult.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:42):**  And then we took that and we raised from similar VCs to found Granular.  So at that point, Granular was only five people.  There were five of us who kind of restarted it and created a early farm management software  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:03:57):**  analytics company.  And so I had five or six different roles, had a ton of fun on the product and commercial  side.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:02):**  And then when we were acquired by Corteva in 2017, ended up as the chief revenue officer  for the digital business at Corteva.  Spent two and a half years there, really learned a lot, but I'm more of a startup guy at heart.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:13):**  So I joined Sanad Agriculture a little less than two years ago as CEO.  Yeah.  I think you said that piqued my interest was on Solon, that the kind of business model  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:22):**  maybe didn't have the scalability that you initially thought it might.  Tell me a little bit more about that.  Yeah.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:29):**  So it was founded by a few Stanford physics PhDs, incredibly smart folks who created the  most advanced soil lab, probably in the world in Ames, Iowa.  It looks like a clean lab that you would use for, for human therapeutics research.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:43):**  And it got you much more accurate soil tests.  Most soil tests are about 20 to 30% inaccurate because of how it's done, the way they dry  soil.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:04:53):**  And if you do wet soil tests, they tend to be a lot more accurate.  So you had this advantage.  But the problem was, even though you could link it to, well, maybe we're over applying  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:05:03):**  fertilizer.  That's what a lot of the soil tests will result in over application of fertilizer, the link  to who really cares about that and who will pay for that given the low cost of soil tests  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:05:14):**  and what happens with ag retailers and farmers in terms of the incentives and agronomists  for land grants, long story short, not much.  And so as we explored that business model and opportunity, the science was exciting,  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:05:27):**  but we didn't see how it was going to lead to the type of returns that investors were  looking for and what farmers and others would value.  What was it like kind of going on that journey and ultimately deciding that you needed to  
**[0:05:38-0:05:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:05:38):**  go the acquisition path?  Well, yeah, it was complex and incredibly personal and emotional.  I had joined with the idea that I would help scale this business.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:05:50):**  And you leap in and excited.  You're talking to all these folks who are recruiting you and the investors who are very  good investors.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:05:55):**  Andresin Horowitz, Kostla, Google Ventures, and also by a CEO at the time, Segoram, who  was a co-founder of OpenTable and been around the block and was very, very good.  And still a good friend of mine.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:09):**  And we kind of went through this journey together because he had only been doing a few months  before me of discovering the path.  And we really went out and talked to the market a lot more, a lot of him and the founders  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:18):**  as well.  That's what does it.  It's almost always like, did you talk to your end customers enough?  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:26):**  Did you talk to your partners enough and ask the direct questions of what you would pay  for XYZ, how this would work?  Too often, folks fall in love with their technology and drink the proverbial Kool-Aid of what  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:36):**  could be.  And if you really get out there and stress test, you will almost always figure that out,  at least as to where is the product market fit today.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:45):**  So I think it's personal to like, oh, shoot, am I going to lose my job?  And are we going to let these employees down and the investors and everything else?  Luckily, the team to the credit of the founders had developed this really cool analytics software  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:06:59):**  that was the kernel of granular and farm management software.  So because of that diversification into not only a physical soil lab, but also some software  analytics, we could say, well, we think this is going to be more of that thing and scalable.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:14):**  And we could broaden this out into business software that helps growers make decisions  and make their lives easier, which was the thesis of granular as a SaaS company for growers.  And since we still had something, we could pivot.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:27):**  And then we pivoted and luckily we were able to find a good home for the solo employees  in the lab with climate and get some capital for that new thing.  So that all took about, I'd say, three to six months.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:39):**  So it was relatively quick.  And there were lots of days and nights where I was up in the middle of the night thinking,  will this work?  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:44):**  And it luckily did, but a lot of it was luck.  There are some great lessons in Adam's story of pivoting.  The science was there, tech was there, but the business model was lacking.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:07:55):**  So how did this major directional change go down with their investors?  The downside is and was that they didn't know much about agriculture.  And it was an area that was completely new to them.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:05):**  What they did and what we did to a certain extent is you try to apply analogs.  So they've seen a lot and they say, well, if it's worked in food or restaurants, would  it work here?  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:16):**  If it's worked in construction, would it work there?  So sometimes you get lucky and that's right.  Other times you hit an industry that's so esoteric.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:22):**  And I argue agriculture is this, where you've got aspects of weather and agronomy and people  and machines.  And it's an ecosystem that's so complex that it's harder to go in and do an Uber or a Lyft.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:37):**  But ultimately it was good we were able to push back and find another route.  And ultimately they were supportive from that.  You have to make sure not just to be like, oh, there's awesome investors involved.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:49):**  They made money here, so they must know what they're talking about.  Not always true.  They would admit that too, right?  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:08:54):**  They know they're not operators and they defer to the folks who are closer if you hire a  good people.  Yeah, 100 percent, hopefully, at least in qualifying investors and finding that right  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:09:03):**  partnership makes a ton of sense.  So in that granular journey, I think some of the commentary as the space has moved on  over the last five or so years is, can SaaS sort of work in agriculture?  
**[0:09:15-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:09:15):**  So I am a couple of years away from it now, but I think the typical SaaS model of someone  paying X dollars per year for pure software is really tough in agriculture.  I think there is very much product market fit among certain types of producers, but  
**[0:09:35-0:09:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:09:35):**  not at large.  And that was something we made a bet that didn't quite play out at granular in the long  term.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:09:43):**  It made out it did very well in the medium term, I'd say short and medium term.  And then I think in the longest term it will.  But the problem is growers don't have a lot of time to learn to use really powerful software.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:09:57):**  They don't have the same resources as an enterprise who has a dedicated tech person or finance  person.  They have to be jack of all trades.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:10:05):**  And as a result, the bar for usability in software has to be consumer grade, which is  really hard to do.  Like if you use Salesforce, which is really effective software interface, it's better,  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:10:16):**  but it's still pretty hard.  Right.  Well, at the same time, you need very powerful functionality because of the complexity of  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:10:24):**  agronomy and decision making analysis and grain marketing and operations.  So what you get is a high bar on both sides of a software build.  And then your market is one where the pay points are relatively low because you're selling  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:10:37):**  to what's an SMB market at the end of the day.  And yes, there are some large growers that doesn't apply.  And that's what our sweet spot was.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:10:44):**  We were successful because we didn't try to attack the whole market.  We went after those where there was pull from early adopters who were larger growers and  who had pain points around using Excel, but we ultimately had trouble crossing the chasm

And it was just fine to use Excel or a few other things here or there.  So what an investor would say is the CAC to ACV ratio, the cost of acquiring the customer

I don't want to be doing a blue.  I think it'll get there, but it's like your typical S curve of tech adoption where it's

If you go to Brazil and Argentina, I actually think it's easier because you've got a lot  more large farms that have like hundreds of thousands of acres or hectares that are management.

**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:12:03):**  I mean, we wrote about this in that article we wrote around Silicon Valley.  We were going to call it how Silicon Valley killed AgTech.  I think we said how Silicon Valley set AgTech back and it's not really true, right?  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:12:10):**  Silicon Valley accelerated this whole space significantly, one of the challenges was that  Silicon Valley investors probably didn't understand all those dynamics that now you have learned  firsthand from doing it on the inside and the power of the channel, right?  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:12:23):**  The power of where a lot of this money is actually made and the power of the supply  chain, which kind of brings us to sound a little bit.  As I understand it, sound had been around for a while doing various things, but you

Was there a moment that that happened?  So I actually knew the co-founders from a ways back we've met, we had coffee in 2014  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:12:45):**  as we were early days at granular and they were very early.  They had just found it sound, it was called a silimar bio at the time.  And they had founded it with a thesis of using chemistry to mimic natural processes between  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:12:59):**  the plant and the soil microbiome to help with abiotic stress.  So at the time they were working on a drought resistant product where you would spray it  on corn and other crops, and it would make them more impervious to drought, need less  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:13:10):**  water yet maintain yield.  And then they were quickly going into nutrient efficiency, which I'll come back to you, but  we had, we had just caught up brainstorm over like, Hey, who, who would be interested in  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:13:20):**  raising money?  Cause you're going through that process.  And I was leading finance at granular at the time.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:13:25):**  And so kept in touch, especially with the CTO and co-founder Travis Bayer.  And then in 2019 heard you mentioned, they're looking for a CEO who was more commercially  minded because both of them are just like geniuses, but more academic technical minds.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:13:42):**  And I said, you know, at this point in the journey, I would hope I raised my hand.  That would be fascinating, especially because while I love software and analytics, I had  worked in physical stuff before with biofuels.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:13:56):**  And this combines the two in terms of the use of biochromatics, the use of product placement  algorithms for these inputs to tackle what I really care about, which is reversing climate  change, water quality, soil health, and healthier food.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:14:09):**  So I went through a little bit of a process and the board, everybody else.  And I ended up showing you mark April 1st, 2020, right at the beginning of COVID.  And it's been a wild ride ever since.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:14:19):**  That is not something that I think often gets people get a window into the sort of, you  know, we talk about, Oh, the academics founding a company and they have this great science.  And then maybe at some point it's, there's a realization that you do need that more commercial  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:14:32):**  mindset or a different skillset to be the CEO.  Tell me a little bit more about what that journey was like.  I imagine it's, it's a tough transition for everyone involved and there's a handover and  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:14:40):**  there's just a bunch of stuff from a personal and leadership level that has to happen.  Yeah, that's a, that's a big one.  Look, I'm a, I'm a first time CEO and so I've had a ton of learning and I have a ton of  
**[0:14:51-0:14:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:14:51):**  learning ahead of me.  The single biggest thing I didn't appreciate was cultural change and everything that goes  along with that.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:14:58):**  And I'll make that a little more tangible because I think it's, I think it's tough to  get your head around.  Because when I came in, we were about 25 people and it was the company had been around for  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:15:08):**  a little while, but relatively small and entering commercial phase, zero revenue.  We had hired a few folks with a lot of experience in ag like 20, 25 years at the Syngenta's,  bears, John Deere's of the world who were great and a lot of experience.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:15:21):**  On the other side, we had a couple of dozen folks from academia who had zero commercial  experience.  And there was no one, I think literally no one at that point who had gone from a zero  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:15:33):**  to X in revenue and seen an exit and really seen the growth path or had been from startups,  classic startups.  So I came in naivete, thinking, all right, well, you know, it's smallish.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:15:44):**  It's probably can shape a lot of different things.  Love this, love this stage.  Let's let's go.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:15:49):**  Reality culture begins when you have the founders and then it just grows from there.  No matter what the size, it's a big part of it and what I was trying to do is create urgency,  create a lot of best practices and other things I'd seen before and getting people there,  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:16:07):**  diversifying the team, listening and being patient and not being like going to China  shop with what I thought was right and had seen was a challenge.  In fact, it was some pretty sobering feedback from his team that made Adam quickly reevaluate  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:16:23):**  his leadership style.  A few months after I joined, we did a culture survey.  So ours had like probably 24 questions.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:16:31):**  And it's things like, do you think the company is going to succeed?  Does it have better products than its peers?  Do you like the culture, et cetera, et cetera?  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:16:38):**  And the score came back.  It was a visible in terms of what I had seen before.  And there were comments that and it's anonymous.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:16:45):**  There are comments that were specifically about me and the change.  I was coming in hot as a change agent where not everyone was on board thinking that that's  how I should act given that's what the board explicitly wanted.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:16:59):**  And it was the right path, but how I was doing it certainly required improvements.  At the same time, we were a few months into COVID and everyone's pessimistic and that's  tough and the ground's moving under our feet everywhere.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:17:12):**  So for the company, it's like COVID, work-life balance, where are you working?  New CEO.  So you're head's spinning, right?  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:17:20):**  And I've never met the CEO in person, only over Zoom.  So there's zero trust established at that point because you have to have shared experience  to create trust.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:17:28):**  And I kind of knew it, but I kind of didn't know it.  And I'm like nervous about proving myself.  So had to step back, have a stiff drink that night and then went back at it, doubled down  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:17:42):**  on listening, but at the same time challenged the team.  We made more changes.  We grew.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:17:48):**  We made more success.  Fast forward to six months later, we had another call transfer survey, much better.  And so now we're above all the benchmarks.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:17:57):**  I just say we're in a drastically better place.  People are happy.  People are engaged.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:18:01):**  The company's rocking and rolling, but man, that shift for the first few months was rough.  And I'm thankful for the team, for the patients and us getting through it.  Yeah.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:18:11):**  Thank you for sharing that.  Well, I'm so curious on that trust point.  Is there anything that you did or any tips that you'd have around building trust, especially  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:18:18):**  in that remote environment?  I know it's been super hard.  I've hired people that worked for me for six months before I met them.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:18:22):**  And in some cases, significant personal things came up.  And so we just had to figure out if we could build trust or not, but that's not what you'd  wish on anyone.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:18:30):**  You also can't do it over a forced Zoom bingo night because that doesn't work either.  So what were you able to do?  So one of the things, which I think is kind of standard advice, which is right, but it's  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:18:43):**  how you do it is important.  You got to meet everybody.  You can't just meet your reports or immediate peers and you've got to go deep into the company  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:18:50):**  if you're coming in as an exec at any level.  And I did that, but I did a little more of a, as a check the box frankly, because there  were so many things happening.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:18:58):**  And by the way, I had to raise around a week after joining because the world was falling  apart and we needed a longer runway.  No one's going to tell you the whole truth from the get-go as the CEO coming in, because  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:19:10):**  without that trust, like they're going to be guarded, afraid of retribution, anonymity,  all that.  So while I met everybody, I didn't really get the story of what could be improved, what  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:19:20):**  people really thought and what they cared about.  I would ask it, but just not in an effective enough way.  And I think in retrospect, there's just nothing I could have done except more time and engagement  
**[0:19:31-0:19:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:19:31):**  and patience.  If you're in normal times, absolutely go out and meet people in person ASAP, get small groups  together, not necessarily the whole company, because once you're over a certain number,  
**[0:19:42-0:19:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:19:42):**  you're not going to create that intimacy and shared experience.  At that point, there was no way we could do it because it was the worst part of COVID.  But eventually when we did have our company event, which we did in August, it's amazing.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:19:54):**  It was amazing.  But if you can't be in person, I frankly think you're kind of doomed until you do.  You can only do so well and you don't have to meet in person constantly, but we're still  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:20:05):**  humans who need that to look at each other in the eye and establish a connection.  I learned a lot from the team and ultimately we've diversified in a way that I think is  amazing where it's those two.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:20:16):**  We still have those two demos, but then we also now have a lot of startup folks that  I pulled over from Granule and other places.  And that balance is very, very powerful.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:20:25):**  And I'd recommend to any AgTech startup or any other space, but if you're all Silicon  Valley types, you're in trouble.  If you're all farm kids, you're probably in trouble.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:20:35):**  If you're all established industry veterans, you're probably in trouble.  You want a bit of that diversification and the respect to listen to each other, and then  you're going to do great things and change the world.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:20:45):**  SoundAg has two main products.  The first aims to enhance the performance of traditional fertilizers to allow farmers  to reduce their fertilizer use.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:20:54):**  And the second product is based on augmenting plant traits to do things like make food taste  better, increase nutrient profiles, or extend shelf life.  So we have these two things.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:21:03):**  How do we do it?  Well, at core, it is very similar to what some of the larger Ag companies have done  with biology plus chemistry.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:21:11):**  It's just, we're looking at it through a very different lens and mechanism of action.  Instead of trying to do that with more artificial means, which I would argue GMOs are and synthetic  bulk chemistry is, we are doing it using the inherent biology in the plant and the soil  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:21:27):**  microbiome.  So one business which is, which is farther along is that nutrient efficiency side, the  flagship product is called source.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:21:36):**  And that is essentially a replacement to nitrogen fertilizer.  You can replace 25 to 50 pounds of nitrogen, which is up to about a third of what farmers  use on corn in particular, the big nitrogen user, or you can apply it without changing  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:21:51):**  your fertilizer strategy and boost yields.  Either way, you get a very high ROI.  And especially today with the skyrocketing fertilizer prices, it's really, really perfect  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:22:01):**  solution for this time and place.  And then, and so that's off to the races we're selling to growers already in the second year.  And then the second part is earlier to give it as like a series a company within the broader  
**[0:22:12-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:22:12):**  series C where we are developing a new way of growing food using epigenetics that is  changing gene expression within the cell.  So instead of you shit, you keep the DNA the same, but you can tune how much the genes  
**[0:22:26-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:22:26):**  are expressed to augment things like taste and shelf life and nutrient profiles.  So a lot of things consumers care about as well as agronomic characteristics.  And while it's early days, we really think that could replace how plants are bred.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:22:42):**  And the big advantage is you can do it much faster.  So we can do all that because it's tuning in a matter of months instead of the typical  seven to 10 years it takes to create a new plant.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:22:51):**  How does that work from an IP perspective?  Like do you own the platform that does the tuning?  Is there a change to the actual seed that then you can patent in terms of its changes?  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:04):**  Like what, how does the, what's IP or kind of defensibility landscape look like there?  It's both.  So yeah, great question at primary strategy, it's about the platform itself.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:14):**  So think of it like CRISPR, but in our view, it's the next generation of CRISPR.  So it's a platform technology that can be used on any plant to go in and soak seeds.  You can also graph, but, but usually we're soaking seeds in a solution of targeted oligonucleotides.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:32):**  And then we've patented this pathway in the cell that takes them up naturally.  It's a natural plant pathway that already exists.  And when the seed is germinating, it takes up these target nucleotides.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:42):**  They then methyl, it's called methylate the DNA.  So they, they change the expression through a methylation pattern.  And then, then you see the effects then, and we've just done this with, with tomato crop,  
**[0:23:54-0:23:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:23:54):**  actually.  You can patent the seeds and the crops that come out of it because those traits are heritable  year to year to year.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:02):**  So that, that was, that was really cool.  This happens naturally like humans have epigenetic effects, plant have epigenetic effect.  The whole idea is if you see an environmental stimulus, you will, your body, your biology  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:14):**  will change in terms of gene expression.  It'll tune itself to evolve that environment.  And in some cases, and usually that's knocked out, meaning that it's temporary because then  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:24):**  the environment changed back, changes back.  But in some cases, there's this fascinating example where in world war II in the Netherlands,  people were starving and their genes and their phenotype, they actually were tuned to absorb  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:37):**  and hold on to more calories as opposed to how their typical metabolism would work.  And so when they came back to abundant food, they, they gained weight really easily.  It was harder to take it off.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:48):**  That effect actually lasted to their kids.  So they saw that in the next generation.  So it was actually heritable, even though it was an epigenetic effect, which is fascinating  
**[0:24:57-0:24:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:24:57):**  to me in terms of this forefront of biology.  And then eventually it petered out through the generations.  Now if you tune the genes in a, in a purposeful way through our process, it's been found that  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:08):**  we could, we could make it so there are more or less sticky.  So you can envision something that tunes itself out over generations or keeps on year after  year after year, which if you're working in seeds and agriculture, you generally want  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:19):**  it to be sticky for production and economic reasons.  So we've talked about biologicals on the podcast.  I know the SORC product isn't technically a biological, it's sort of got a biochemical  
**[0:25:29-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:29):**  approach in terms of the product.  And from a channel perspective, you guys are selling through sort of traditional channels,  albeit smaller ones.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:37):**  Tell me a little bit about the business model for that first product.  Yeah, absolutely.  So to start off on the product, it is a chemistry product.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:46):**  So it comes in a jug, it comes in a gallon jug and it's a liquid suspension.  So it looks and feels very much like a crop production product that farmers and retailers  are used to.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:25:56):**  And it's shelf stable for a similar period of time, a couple of years, which is a big  advantage versus microbes, where you have to be very purposeful and think about the  cold storage chain because they're live microorganisms.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:08):**  And once you open them up, you've got about 24 hours usually to apply them, which it's  not always easy if you get rained out and your planter sits there overnight because  it's a chemistry, it's less material and less subject to different variables in the soil.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:23):**  The soil already has billions of microbes in it, and they already fix nitrogen and already  solubilize phosphorus and already break down micronutrients for the plant.  That's the natural ecosystem that has existed for millennia.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:38):**  By the way, I'm a fan of microbes because I think that also has a solution, but you  don't necessarily need them if you can stimulate what's already in the soil.  So ours gets added to the tank of a sprayer and it's a very small application, right?  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:26:52):**  It's about an ounce per acre.  And then it goes across the field, they spray it with whatever else they're doing, fungicide,  herbicide, pesticide, and it gets a free ride.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:27:02):**  So it's zero additional causes, zero additional friction to the grower, and it just sits on  their shelf without any expertise to add.  Then it stimulates those microbes already in the soil to fix and solubilize phosphorus.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:27:13):**  And so as a result, we see effects in not just corn, which we launched source corn in  early 2020, but also soybeans, which we launched in earlier this year.  And then we're also testing wheat, canola, cotton, a lot of other aspects because those  
**[0:27:28-0:27:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:27:28):**  two macronutrients N and P are the most important because the volume is so small.  We can go direct to grower as well as sell through independent dealers in addition to  retail.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:27:41):**  So whereas typical crop protection has to go out through retail because it's a bulk  thing that's being distributed and that's hard for companies, we don't have that challenge.  We can send it via UPS or FedEx.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:27:53):**  And we work with amazing dealers on the ground to sell the product because of relationship  to the cores and because they're consultative sellers, but we're not, there's no barrier  because of the logistics like other aspects of the space.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:28:05):**  Thanks.  Yeah, that's really helpful.  It's good timing, as you mentioned, in terms of fertilizer prices and a general tailwind  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:28:10):**  around sustainability.  How are those two factors playing out in terms of conversations you're having with partners  or customers?  
**[0:28:17-0:28:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:28:17):**  It is pretty unique.  I think you've seen nitrogen prices double, in some cases even higher, but double in the  last year.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:28:25):**  And that's due to higher cost of production with natural gas prices.  It's due to higher logistics prices and shipping and container issues and just the general  inflationary environment with crop prices having been higher.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:28:38):**  And I don't think that's going to slow down anytime soon.  I don't think it'll be forever, but the inflationary pressures are unlikely to abate in the next  year to two.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:28:48):**  And a lot of growers are anxious that they're just not going to be able to find nitrogen,  which is the key macronutrient for yield, let alone pay for it.  So our product, the price is basically the same as it was last year.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:29:02):**  We increased production 10x from last year and we're seeing a lot of product market fit.  I love it.  Tell me about that product market fit feeling.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:29:13):**  I love that comment because usually when, especially in the tech world, you talk about  that feeling of like zero to one or product market fit, it's like, has this sense of data  and like looking at the usage chart, like it's almost like, you know, I got this many  
**[0:29:24-0:29:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:29:24):**  likes on my tweet is like almost the feeling that people talk about.  But obviously in this case, it's quite different, but also similar.  Tell me a little bit more about what that feels like.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:29:32):**  I think it's very similar.  When I say that everyone has their own flavor on it, but for me, a feeling is I'm pretty  data driven.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:29:39):**  So it is a mix of data, but I think what people say, they use their gut.  I think they're actually making a lot of nuanced and sometimes imperceptible calculations and  analysis in their own head.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:29:52):**  And then it comes out this mash of gut.  And so when I say feeling, that's exactly what I mean.  It's one experience of having seen things in ag tech now a few times in different aspects  
**[0:30:03-0:30:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:30:03):**  of the industry and seeing what works versus not.  It's having read, you know, all the business books and having the second hand experience  of talking to people of what their product fit looks like, it's three, our own data of  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:30:15):**  efficacy.  It's coming through on field trials.  It's more stories and anecdotes on Twitter and Facebook and our own sales force coming  
**[0:30:23-0:30:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:30:23):**  back with, wow, your product got me 10 X ROI, or like, here's a picture of a field of the  corn, which where we applied it, the corn still standing and the other side it's blown  down because the root structure wasn't as strong.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:30:38):**  So it's all those things that's gotten me pretty excited over the last month in particular.  You know, given the what you've kind of learned in the ag tech space and what has and hasn't  worked, it's really interesting that you've ended up in the kind of input space and the  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:30:53):**  epigenetic space, like in some ways more traditional and other ways really rethinking what those  can be like.  And then also raising sort of venture money, although with an ag flavor to kind of come  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:31:03):**  in, you guys just raised a 40 million series C extension, 45 million.  Yeah.  Any kind of closing thoughts there on the investor startup partnership model in ag and  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:31:14):**  ag tech and kind of what you learned in this recent round?  Well, one piece that you kind of reminded me of, which is, which, which I think is interesting  is how bucketized are these spaces versus how fluid are they?  
**[0:31:28-0:31:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:31:28):**  Mark, in recent was right when he said software is eating the world.  However, software can't do it alone.  You also do physical stuff.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:31:33):**  So the reality is all companies will be a mix of tech and physical in the future.  And we're, we're doing exactly that.  So whereas most of it is straight inputs, we also have some algorithms and, and, and  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:31:47):**  data science work because that drastically speeds up things on the plant breeding side,  you need models and bioinformatics in order to know exactly where to target on the genome.  And that's a core data science on the source side for any input, including ours and by  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:32:03):**  biologicals and whatever seeds, they don't work the same on every acre.  And so what we've launched is we've already done this and we need to improve it, but we've  launched a thing called performance optimizer, which you can go on our website and you can  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/1/11/the-tricky-business-of-scaling-soil-tech-adam-litle-ceo-sound-agriculture#t=0:32:14):**  put in your pH, your organic matter and your cation exchange capacity.  And it'll spit out.  If we think you're going to have an excellent response, a good response or a poor response.

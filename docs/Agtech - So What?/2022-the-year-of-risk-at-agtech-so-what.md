### Agtech - So What?  (2022-12-22)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What.  2022 has been a wild ride for, well, the world and for us here at Tenacious Ventures.  Not only have we relaunched all our activities under the Tenacious Ventures brand, begun  
**[0:00:16-0:00:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:00:16):**  raising our second fund, and sharing our experiences out loud while we do it, but we've also covered  a ton of ground here on the podcast and in our written work.  Since January, we've published 31 episodes, covering everything from scaling soil tech  
**[0:00:31-0:00:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:00:31):**  to the future of AgTech marketing to alternative protein, novel investing tactics, and recently,  the next generation of farm inputs.  As the year draws to a close, we wanted to take some time to reflect on what we've learned  
**[0:00:44-0:00:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:00:44):**  and pull on some of the key threads that we see linking these diverse areas of AgTech  together.  For us, given the state of financial markets, the current climate, and even global geopolitics,  
**[0:00:56-0:01:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:00:56):**  the most important concept that emerged for us this year, and that we'll be tracking into  2023, is around how the food system deals with risk.  So for today's special bonus episode, the final one of the year, you'll be hearing snippets  
**[0:01:09-0:01:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:01:09):**  from some of our favorite episodes from this year, along with our latest analysis on how  certain insights will be even more important in a riskier future.  Our most recent Thinking About Risk has focused on farm inputs, and how factors from the invasion  
**[0:01:24-0:01:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:01:24):**  of Ukraine to climate disruptions and supply chain snarls are affecting farm business models.  We've discussed fertilizer alternatives a lot recently, but how to manage pressure on  other inputs, like pesticides, is just as critical.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:01:39):**  As we look ahead, we see that transitioning away from synthetic inputs and broadening  the management toolkit will be key in derisking crop protection.  But synthetics are incredibly powerful, and biologicals, for all their benefits, are not  
**[0:01:52-0:02:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:01:52):**  a direct replacement.  Instead, we expect that the new toolkit will be a combination of biological and digital.  Here's Andrew Bate, CEO of Swarm Farm Robotics, which, for full disclosure, is one of our  
**[0:02:04-0:02:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:02:04):**  portfolio companies.  So a lot of our robots go out with weed detection cameras on board the robots, so they detect  individual weeds, and just spot spray them with a herbicide when they see a weed.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:02:16):**  It's technology that's been around for quite a while, but the uptake of it's been fairly  low today.  But on board a robot, it's a match made in heaven.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:02:24):**  The autonomy adds so much more value to that technology compared to being on a tractor.  And so that technology is now deeply integrated in our robots.  There's actually two and soon to be three companies that have that technology now integrated  
**[0:02:37-0:02:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:02:37):**  onto our robots.  So there's choices for farmers as to which technology suits them better.  And it's a really good ROI and delivering big results for farmers in terms of saving  
**[0:02:46-0:02:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:02:46):**  the amount of pesticide they use each year.  We're not talking about 10% saving, we're talking 60 to 80% savings over a season, and  sometimes up to 99% savings in a single operation.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:02:59):**  But more exciting is things that are coming.  I think some really smart weeding technology coming, whether it's mechanical or heat based  like lasers or steam, it can kill weeds.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:03:08):**  That's really smart technology that's coming like a freight train now.  I think the efficient use of nitrogen is probably somewhere in the middle.  Obviously, at the moment, you nearly need to sell your left kidney to get hold of nitrogen  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:03:18):**  fertilizer now.  The cost is phenomenal, but you just can't get it at times with well supply chains and  what's going on.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:03:24):**  At the same time, you've got all the pressure with ESG and emissions and the need to clean  up the environment as well.  And I think there's some really smart technology out there that's going to let us fundamentally  
**[0:03:34-0:03:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:03:34):**  shift the efficiency of nitrogen use on board robots through smart application.  And it's not necessarily going to be hugely high tech.  It's just going to be smartly applied and going to make a real difference.  
**[0:03:45-0:04:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:03:45):**  When we think about the financial and environmental benefits of reducing input use by over 50%  autonomy and the new types of practices it opens up, like when, how, or even what you  apply, it seems like an incredibly powerful risk mitigator.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:04:00):**  We also see there being novel digitally enabled financial layers to risk management in the  future.  The first part of this is insurance, and we actually ended up doing four episodes on insurance  
**[0:04:10-0:04:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:04:10):**  in ag tech this year.  You can find all the links in the show notes, but the two that focused on parametric, one  from a founder's perspective and one from a farmer's stood out to me.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:04:20):**  Parametric insurance, which ensures a policy holder at a specific level against the occurrence  of a specific event might sound simple, but it could be really paradigm shifting because  one of the biggest barriers to ag insurance becoming more innovative and more digitally  
**[0:04:33-0:04:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:04:33):**  native is the high touch nature of traditional insurance products.  Insurance adjusters, in other words, have to physically come to your farm to evaluate  what was damaged and to what extent.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:04:44):**  This conventional model is extremely expensive, but parametric can remove the humans by instead  having payout triggers that can be sensed remotely like precipitation or temperature.  And when we begin to challenge the current models in the ag insurance space, a lot of  
**[0:04:59-0:05:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:04:59):**  other options become viable as well.  This clip from my conversation with Damon Johnson, the director of strategic projects  at parametric.ag based in Saskatchewan, Canada, captures an idea that we've spent a lot of  
**[0:05:11-0:05:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:05:11):**  time thinking about since the episode aired.  Let's take the coverage and let's just package it in the bag or in the jug or whatever the  packages that goes out to the farm and just give that peace of mind to the farmer that  
**[0:05:22-0:05:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:05:22):**  as they purchase this product, it's already coming with the coverage.  And I almost liken it to like canola seed or a corn seed that has a treatment on it  that as you put it in the ground, you have protection against insects or disease, but  
**[0:05:34-0:05:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:05:34):**  you also have protection against heat.  And it's just something you can't see, but it's there.  This idea of embedded insurance products that could be offered as a kind of product add-on  
**[0:05:43-0:05:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:05:43):**  has really stuck with me as a trend to watch.  And it seems like it struck a chord with our listeners as well.  We saw an incredible response to the insurance series with many listeners like you wanting  
**[0:05:52-0:06:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:05:52):**  to share your experiences around what we discussed.  One of those conversations was so good, we made it into a bonus episode.  It was a discussion between my business partner and occasional co-host Matthew Pryor and New  
**[0:06:04-0:06:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:06:04):**  South Wales farmer Tom Ferguson.  I keyed in specifically when Tom started discussing the challenge of using parametric tools today.  He described how getting the most out of his insurance requires him to really delve into  
**[0:06:17-0:06:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:06:17):**  the numbers, which he admitted is not for everyone.  But given that he identifies weather and emotions as the two biggest risks to his business,  taking the time to understand the numbers and being able to set up his parametric policy  
**[0:06:30-0:06:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:06:30):**  accordingly helps him manage both.  Matthew went on to challenge Tom on the price of these policies and whether lack of predictability  might make it hard for this tech to gain widespread adoption.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:06:43):**  Here's Tom's response.  Insurance can be as cheap or as expensive as you want it to be, especially if parametric  because you're coming up with the metrics.  
**[0:06:52-0:07:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:06:52):**  So how much risk do you want to ensure?  That will reflect the price of the policy.  If you want to ensure you're going to get above average rainfall five years out of 10,  
**[0:07:03-0:07:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:07:03):**  then your insurance will be very expensive.  But if you just want to ensure decile one and decile 10 or both of them, then it will  be cheap because its incidence is so low.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:07:13):**  So you can make it whatever you like.  And I can say, I want to make sure we're going to have an 800ml rainfall this year.  We're already at 580ml.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:07:22):**  So probably not much point me ensuring that because we're halfway through the year and  we're nearly there.  Our moisture profile will carry us through anyway.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:07:33):**  And the chance of us getting 800ml a year is like two out of 10.  It is going to be expensive.  The way I can see us pricing these policies, and this is after a bit of experience with  
**[0:07:44-0:07:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:07:44):**  them, our main risk is no rain.  If you look back in history, we are drier than we are wetter.  And you can't get too cute with how we work this out because you'll drive yourself insane.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:07:55):**  You won't be able to find an answer.  So we've got to be a little bit broad with that and say, okay, if we don't get 60ml of  rain every quarter, then every quarter is a payout situation.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:08:06):**  So we pay a premium every quarter, and that might be a bank guaranteed premium over five  years.  If we get our 60ml, great, that's fantastic.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:08:15):**  We're halfway to average every quarter if we get that.  If we don't, then we know that there'll be whatever the value of the policy will be,  $250,000 every quarter coming in.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:08:27):**  That makes me think you talked about people's, whether it's interest or skill ability.  You also referred to the company that you work with there.  They're pretty good at helping out.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:08:38):**  It feels like there is a kind of role there where the digitally native version of an agronomist  should have just as much familiarity with these tools as on the agronomy side because  of those increased kind of production risks that everybody's going to be exposed to.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:08:57):**  Do you think that's where as this grows, people will source that kind of skill from?  As the appetite grows, there will have to be someone sitting in the middle there, I  suppose.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:09:08):**  I've heard this of a state agribusiness manager.  Where do you guys see yourselves fitting into this?  We're spending money to ensure that paying back any liabilities to you.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:09:19):**  We don't have to do that.  We have no obligation to do that.  His answer was, look, we really don't know anything about this.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:09:26):**  I said, okay, let's put it in a different term.  If we're spending this money to ensure you're getting your money back, can you give us a  cut in our margin because we're being more responsible than the person over the fence?  
**[0:09:38-0:09:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:09:38):**  And he said, oh, we've really got no appetite for that.  We already know we can get our money back and you're not a risk to us anyway, so it  doesn't really matter.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:09:46):**  I said, well, that is a really poor answer to what's trying to happen here.  Would you lend harder if we had a five year policy to ensure that we had X money coming  in if it didn't rain?  
**[0:09:58-0:10:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:09:58):**  He said, no, probably not.  Maybe we should go and find someone who does align with their values.  I love Tom's final point here about how these new risk management tools may mean he has  
**[0:10:07-0:10:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:10:07):**  to be more discerning about the partners his business works with.  This potential shift in the power balance for savvy farmers could be transformative  and is something we'll continue to watch in the insurance space and beyond.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:10:20):**  It alludes to the broader set of challenges that we expect to see in value chains, from  new skills to functions occurring at entirely different parts of the system.  This last one, the idea of distributed or decentralized infrastructure is a big one  
**[0:10:33-0:10:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:10:33):**  that we believe will unlock new economics and impacts.  Now however much the new world of digital, biological and mechanical risk management  tools have captivated us this year, we're still tech nerds deep down.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:10:45):**  So we were stoked about the many responses we got to our episode featuring Matthew's  theory on the three fears of ag data.  Today when you hear someone talking about the risks of farm data, I think it's easy  
**[0:10:56-0:11:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:10:56):**  to assume that what's being discussed is the risk that a farmer might part with data  for too low a price, that the data might somehow be used against them, or that it will somehow  fall into the wrong hands.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:11:07):**  From our perspective though, what matters when we think about a more resilient and adaptable  future for agriculture has little to do with these concerns and everything to do with how  telling those kinds of stories biases growers and industry alike against some really transformative  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:11:22):**  technologies.  Here's Matthew.  I think that's the, that is the challenge, right?  
**[0:11:27-0:11:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:11:27):**  It is now a human psychology challenge, which is we have framed the conversation permanently  in terms of fear.  And so the payment is the hurdle, which will get me over my fear.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:11:42):**  And I think we've just, whilst ever we frame the conversation that way, we're not going  to make the progress and it doesn't get us to those other benefits of systems working  better.  
**[0:11:51-0:12:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:11:51):**  I think when you, yeah, you talk about this digitally native, there's huge initiatives  around that in autonomous vehicles in transport, like all, everything that a company learns  navigating the streets of any given city is going to make every autonomous vehicle safer.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:12:07):**  And surely that's better and equally applies vehicle autonomy on farms.  Why wouldn't that equally apply with all of the models that will be used to provide insurance  and other kinds of risk transfer products, which make, is going to make agriculture better,  
**[0:12:21-0:12:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:12:21):**  is going to provide better economics in the face of significant climate challenges.  We need those other parts to be, to work as well as they can.  No matter what part of ag tech you care about, from software to equipment, to biologicals,  
**[0:12:33-0:12:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:12:33):**  there are barriers to adoption that arise from this conversation about ag data.  Unwinding these perceptions and creating alternate compelling narratives is no small feat, but  in our minds, successfully navigating the baggage that ag tech is struggling with around  
**[0:12:47-0:12:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:12:47):**  farm data will be one of the big differences between companies that become leaders in the  coming years and those that get left behind.  Finally, as we come full circle in our thinking about the risks that the ag industry will  
**[0:12:59-0:13:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:12:59):**  be facing moving forward, there's the most difficult kind to understand, the risk of  the unknown.  One conversation I had this year offered a little peek into the scale and scope of the  
**[0:13:10-0:13:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:13:10):**  kind of risks that are largely still hypothetical and little known in ag, but that could given  a little time, become a, or even the most important driver in the global market.  Here's Amy Brooke, farmer at Cyclone Farms in Nebraska, who spent time during her formative

With us being in Brazil and understanding how many acres that that country that are  not in the Amazon have to bring on board for production acres, over 200 million additional  
**[0:13:40-0:13:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:13:40):**  acres are potentially waiting in the wings depending on pricing.  Like right now, you can see in 2012 how the evolution of Eastern Europe and South America  really gained an acre to contribute to commodity-based crops.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:13:55):**  It looked like something that we'd want to insulate ourselves a little bit better to  just be more in the specialty category as well.  Amy's point here about risk and about how she plans to mitigate it in her own operation

Amy's farm, like most large-scale grain production farms in the world, is already facing competition  
**[0:14:17-0:14:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:14:17):**  on a global scale, competition that's only becoming more intense.  That's why we think that for farms, like all businesses, identifying and refining a competitive  advantage will be the most important determiner of long-term success over the next 100 years.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:14:32):**  And failure to do so, especially in a climate-changing world, may well be an existential risk.  From our perspective, the uniting theme is the challenge and the opportunity for agtech  companies in 2023 and beyond to determine how your business can help your customer,  
**[0:14:47-0:14:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/2022-the-year-of-risk-at-agtech-so-what#t=0:14:47):**  whether farmer or more broadly in the supply chain, identify, refine, and or perfect their  competitive advantage.  Whether it's the increasingly low-input farmer, the advisor or vendor that transitions to

This has been just a small sampling of the fabulous insights we've gained while creating

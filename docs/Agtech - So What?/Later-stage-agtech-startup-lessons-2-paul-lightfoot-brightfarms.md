**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:16):**  I'm actually not a guy who struggles with his ego, mostly, right?  
**[0:00:20-0:00:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:20):**  But I'm still a person, so it's hard.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:23):**  I just remember we'd have Tuesday leadership meetings, and I just remember thinking, this  
**[0:00:27-0:00:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:27):**  guy's doing things differently than I would do.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:29):**  And it would make me upset.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:32):**  And I'd sit there, try not to talk.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:34):**  Why does this make me upset?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:38):**  That's Paul Lightfoot, the founder and president of Bright Farms, who made the difficult decision  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:42):**  to voluntarily step back from the CEO role in the startup he founded for the overall  
**[0:00:47-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:47):**  benefit of the company.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:48):**  And as you'll hear, this transition was not easy.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:51):**  He had to get used to watching someone else steer the ship.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:55):**  Looking back, Paul has made many tough decisions for Bright Farms in building it to become  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:59):**  a leading provider of locally grown packaged salads in the U.S. Paul came up with the idea  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:04):**  for Bright Farms back in 2011.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:06):**  And now, 10 years later, the company has five hydroponic greenhouse farms, 300 employees,  
**[0:01:12-0:01:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:12):**  and big plans to keep expanding sales.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:14):**  And just this year, Bright Farms was acquired by the global conglomerate Cox Enterprises.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:19):**  So let's meet Paul.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:23):**  I grew up in Southern California, went to college in Pennsylvania, law school in New  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:27):**  York City, and very briefly was like a white shoe Wall Street lawyer, which is, I think,  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:33):**  hard for people to imagine now.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:35):**  It was a great experience.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:36):**  It wasn't my calling, pretty safe to say.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:39):**  And I actually left when I was 28, not because I hated it, which is why everybody else left  
**[0:01:44-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:44):**  and everybody, everyone that could would leave.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:46):**  I left it because my dad had been dying slowly and it was at the end of that period of our  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:50):**  lives.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:51):**  This is a long time ago.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:52):**  I decided I wasn't going to be able to be present while I was working a thousand hours  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:57):**  a week.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:58):**  And so I just went home, quit my job, went home and spent some time with my mom, with  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:01):**  my dad.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:02):**  And when I was there, I had a couple of months to sort of think about what was next.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:06):**  I was like, hey, it's late 90s.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:09):**  If there's ever a time in life to become an entrepreneur, all I have is a bike and it  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:13):**  wasn't even a valuable one.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:14):**  I didn't have a mortgage.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:15):**  I didn't have a wife.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:16):**  I didn't have anything slowing me down.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:19):**  And I just came up with an idea for a startup, which was called Foodline, one word, Foodline,  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:24):**  very much like open table, but starting on the East Coast and fighting out from New York  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:29):**  to the rest of the country.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:30):**  And just had a wild time, raised a bunch of money from American Express, the Zagat survey.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:35):**  Remember those little purple restaurant guidebooks and the Ticketmaster City Search division  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:39):**  of Barry Diller's IAC.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:40):**  So just went from like being a lawyer to being an entrepreneur in like 30 seconds.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:46):**  Didn't know a thing, but I had a lot of energy and a lot of just a lot of energy.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:53):**  How did you come up with that idea to go into that space?  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:55):**  Was that a sector you were covering or like to jump into that kind of food and restaurant  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:59):**  world?  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:00):**  I had worked in restaurants.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:02):**  I was one of these like scrappy college kids working as a line cook and then a bartender  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:06):**  during law school in New York City.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:08):**  But I think I was like collaborating with a chef.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:11):**  We called him Chef Bob.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:12):**  He was a guy that was a chef at a restaurant I was bartending at while I was in law school.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:16):**  And I think we actually said, let's try to come up with an idea.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:18):**  I'm not one of these people that believes that you have to wait for lightning to strike.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:22):**  You sit down and you decide to find some lightning.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:25):**  That's what writing is about.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:26):**  So we just sat down and decided to come up with an idea, like the idea of being in the  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:31):**  restaurant space and just look for an area that things could be better with technology  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:36):**  and automating the reservation book and the customer information.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:40):**  It turned out to be a great idea.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:42):**  We didn't win.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:43):**  We actually ended up raising much money, grew like crazy, 23 cities, a few hundred employees  
**[0:03:48-0:03:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:48):**  in like less than 24 months.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:50):**  It was breakneck, felt reckless, but that was what we had to do at that time.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:57):**  Our board meetings, the KPIs were like salespeople hired and customers acquired.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:01):**  Wasn't cash, wasn't salespeople and customers.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:05):**  And when the NASDAQ crashed, we were way too overextended.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:08):**  We couldn't get a series C done and we wound it up.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:11):**  And the transition for me then was a little bit lucky.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:15):**  Someone who had been watching me sort of thought I had some promise.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:18):**  I was a kid.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:19):**  I was 30 probably.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:22):**  This guy owned three businesses and two of them were in trouble.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:25):**  And he basically said, why don't you come in and take one of the really shitty ones  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:29):**  and see if you can fix it.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:31):**  And it was a company that automated the distribution center operations of like mid-market retailers,  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:37):**  like the $2 billion size range retailers, like Jim Baree and Urban Outfitters.

**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:43):**  There was a lot of apparel clients.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:45):**  He said, you can shut it down, you can sell it, or you can fix it.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:50):**  You just can't have any cash.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:51):**  I've been propping up payroll for like three years, no more cash.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:55):**  And that was an amazingly narrow view to have in a way that was very useful.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:00):**  Every dollar I spent, I collected for my customers.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:02):**  And so I just went out and met with my customers and talked them into doing new projects.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:07):**  And I did that for about nine years.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:09):**  And that was where I learned business, like quarter after quarter, managing to cashflow,  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:14):**  managing to receivables.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:15):**  It was a very, very pure way to grow a business.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:20):**  And that was really my 30s.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:21):**  It sounds like a sort of polar opposite to the startup experience in terms of kind of  
**[0:05:26-0:05:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:26):**  how that ran.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:27):**  What was hard about the startup experience?  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:29):**  I mean, probably wrapping it up and firing those people or what was challenging about  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:32):**  it or what were some of your takeaways?  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:34):**  I mean, I think the hard part was now I can see when there's something that has to be  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:40):**  done, it doesn't matter what the uncomfortable nature of it is.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:44):**  You have to do it.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:45):**  But when I was 30, I didn't necessarily understand that as clearly.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:49):**  And I had never been in a business like this.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:52):**  Everybody that worked there was older than me.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:55):**  I actually was intending to represent the owners and manage a president of the company.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:00):**  But when I sat down with him, he was like, here's the constraints.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:02):**  Let's make this work.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:03):**  He, that didn't believe me, was unwilling to see it for what it was.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:08):**  He had been the guy that had had his payrolls propped up for years.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:11):**  And I was like, cash, it's all cash.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:13):**  We're going to manage to weekly cash flows going forward.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:16):**  And we're going to, you and I are going to sit down on a whiteboard and map out weekly  
**[0:06:19-0:06:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:19):**  cash flows, looking at six weeks.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:22):**  And he just, he was just always putting assumptions in that were bullshit.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:27):**  J. Crew is going to come in for a $600,000 receivable in five weeks.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:31):**  And I'd say, great.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:32):**  When do you talk to him next?  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:33):**  And I would get on the phone with the sales guy and the J. Crew people were, they weren't  
**[0:06:36-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:36):**  even close to buying.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:38):**  And so eventually I said, you need to fix this or get out of the way.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:42):**  And he was like, Hey kid, you've got a lot to learn.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:46):**  And I said, I am, I'm sure I do.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:48):**  I'm here to learn in fact, but in the meantime, cash flow next week, cash flow the week after  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:52):**  next.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:53):**  And I think if I was put back in that situation, I wouldn't have waited, you know, in hindsight,  
**[0:06:58-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:58):**  it was probably five weeks until I let him go.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:00):**  I would have done it on the second day if I could go back.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:03):**  Cause I can just see that stuff so much clearly now, pattern recognition is what I lacked  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:07):**  when I was 30.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:08):**  You know, and then it was, there were certain strategic things that looking back, I think  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:12):**  were quite obvious.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:13):**  Like we were manufacturing hardware that we could buy off the market for lower, lower  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:19):**  costs and with better sort of functionality.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:22):**  But we had a group of people that were building this hardware and designing the hardware.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:25):**  And so this company didn't have the ability to see that that was a strategic mistake.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:30):**  And that probably took me like seven months to sort of execute on and looking back, that  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:35):**  was such an easy, blindingly easy insight to see if I went back and saw that again,  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:40):**  I would be like, Oh yeah, again, second day, like we're going to be generous in treating  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:44):**  those people well and asking them to move on to the rest of their careers.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:47):**  But this company will fail if we manufacture a worst thing for higher costs than the rest  
**[0:07:52-0:07:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:52):**  of the market enjoys.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:54):**  Super interesting.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:55):**  And that kind of loss aversion, right?  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:56):**  It's such a part of human psychology.  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:57):**  Like it's already here and these people and they're doing it like we should find a way  
**[0:07:59-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:59):**  to keep it.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:00):**  I think that's fascinating.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:01):**  What's the other one.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:02):**  I was just listening to a podcast about how we're really bad at subtraction.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:05):**  Like we, as humans try to fix problems by adding things.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:07):**  And we rarely go to like, what if I just took this away, but in business, it's so key, right?  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:11):**  How do you cut your losses or how do you make those tough decisions?  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:15):**  I mean, that's like, I remember the founder of Intuit.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:18):**  No, no, it was someone who came on to run Intuit after the founder had hired him, I  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:22):**  think.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:23):**  And someone described how this guy, he would go into the department heads and be like,  
**[0:08:27-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:27):**  what's your budget for next year?  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:28):**  And they'd be like, Oh, I'm going to, I'm going to go from 12 million to 14 and here's  
**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:31):**  why.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:32):**  And he'd be like, no, no, no.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:33):**  I'm going to go from zero and just build up from there.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:35):**  And that's it.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:36):**  I think it always has to be zero budgeting.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:39):**  Like you have to start with as if there was nothing, what's our plan, right?

**[0:08:45-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:45):**  So you were running the software slash hardware business.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:48):**  We still haven't gotten all the way to Bright Farms.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:50):**  So what happened next?  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:52):**  So let's see.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:54):**  This was my thirties, right?  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:55):**  So I grew up as a business person in my thirties with that business.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:59):**  But I also was like, if you can imagine a spectrum from like normal food people to super  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:03):**  weird food people, I was just making my way across that spectrum.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:07):**  So I think like in college, I think I was, I remember like cooking food for my housemates  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:12):**  and they thought that was weird because I didn't go on and go.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:14):**  So I think I always had this like inclination to food.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:16):**  I worked in tons of restaurants, but by the time I was in my early thirties, I started  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:21):**  making these connections between like my health and my food related lifestyle choices.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:27):**  And I can remember like very specific books and movies and like meeting with nutritionists  
**[0:09:32-0:09:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:32):**  where I thought, oh, I'm not on the path I want to be on.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:35):**  Right.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:36):**  And so I was just early to really early to organic early to local early to plant centric  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:41):**  eating.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:42):**  And I started wishing near the end of my thirties that I had a career in food in a particular,  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:49):**  I could already see that my sort of personal mission was about food that was better for  
**[0:09:53-0:09:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:53):**  the environment and better for health.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:55):**  Right.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:56):**  And I was typecast by the world as like a software CEO.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:58):**  This, you know, this is my second company is a technology CEO and I built a nice niche  
**[0:10:04-0:10:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:04):**  in this like retail supply chain technology stuff.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:06):**  Right.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:07):**  And I just decided I wanted to do something that had some religion in it, something that  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:11):**  had more purpose to it.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:13):**  And I just decided to leave.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:14):**  And there were, I mean, there were other reasons with that company.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:16):**  I'd sort of, I think I'd sort of reached my natural state to move on anyway.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:20):**  I was getting bored with what it was.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:22):**  It wasn't that it wasn't fun to talk about it at cocktail parties.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:25):**  And I'd like to have fun stories and fun things.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:28):**  And so I just started thinking about ideas like headhunters.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:31):**  Weren't calling me with like, you know, sustainable local food companies.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:35):**  They didn't exist.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:37):**  They didn't exist at the time.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:38):**  It was like 2009, 2010.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:39):**  I was thinking about this.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:40):**  And so I ended up developing the idea for Bright Farms inspired by a friend of mine  
**[0:10:45-0:10:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:45):**  who had founded a renewable energy company called Sun Edison.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:48):**  He had stayed at my house when they raised, he and Jigar Shah raised that first round  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:53):**  of capital from Goldman Sachs.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:55):**  I remember taking the train in with him to the city when he was on that first meeting.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:00):**  And he told me the business model and it was beautiful and elegant and it just stuck in  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:03):**  my head.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:04):**  And several years later, I just thought, what if I could apply that business model with  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:08):**  produce to food retailers?  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:11):**  And I found some guys that were doing like rooftop greenhouses for schools on like a  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:16):**  demonstration education scale.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:19):**  And I gave him the idea.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:20):**  I think I built the deck and I gave him the idea.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:22):**  He said, this is what you should do and I'll support you.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:25):**  I'll be an investor.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:26):**  I'll be a board member.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:27):**  And they were like, wow, big idea.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:29):**  We like the idea.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:30):**  And they were like, but we're like the science philanthropy types.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:33):**  Like we don't think we could sell to retailers.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:35):**  We don't think it would raise capital.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:36):**  I remember the Ted Capolo, who was sort of the co-founder of the digital bright funds.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:39):**  When he said that, I thought, those are the things that I can do.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:42):**  Like I sell big projects to retailers and I love raising capital, you know, and I always  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:47):**  have.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:48):**  And so I just decided I'm going to do it, but this is the part with the wife.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:52):**  I brought the idea home and I said, Hey, it's time for the next startup.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:57):**  And she said, she literally just said, no, she said, you know, that was in your twenties.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:02):**  Now you have a mortgage, three kids, you know, you're a software CEO.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:07):**  And I was like, no, no, I was a software CEO.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:10):**  This is my calling.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:11):**  And she's like, I'm not interested in calling.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:15):**  And yet you did it anyways, and I'm sure she was supportive, but I think that point is  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:18):**  so interesting about like identities and that people, you know, we put each other in boxes.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:24):**  Did you have to break the mold of being a software CEO yourself or kind of how you thought  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:27):**  of yourself to, to become a founder in this slightly different world?  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:30):**  Well, yeah, I mean, everybody suffers from the imposter syndrome when they're challenging  
**[0:12:35-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:35):**  themselves.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:36):**  Right.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:37):**  So, and I'm making myself sound like the bad guy here.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:39):**  I conceded a slower on-ramp.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:42):**  Like I did a few months, like maybe a half a year of consulting work while I was building  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:46):**  a business plan to raise some capital.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:48):**  So I convinced her to let me do it.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:51):**  She got me to concede sort of a less risky transition because I was, I was sort of all  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:56):**  in and willing to embrace all risk.

**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:01):**  Like, so, and I was sort of like, Hey, you're the stable one.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:04):**  Why can't I take on the risk?  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:06):**  So that, that was a big part of it as well.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:09):**  And so Paul officially began his Bright Farms journey, but this time he had experience as  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:13):**  an entrepreneur and more tools and tactics to draw on.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:17):**  I knew what my leadership philosophies were.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:20):**  I knew the sort of management culture and style the company was going to have.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:25):**  Before I even hired a single employee, I'd written out the core values and beliefs that  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:29):**  weren't even edited until nine years later.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:32):**  And they're still 90% intact from the very beginning.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:35):**  Cause I just recognized how important it is to do that from the get-go.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:40):**  I'd been, you know, I'd spent 15 years thinking about those things.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:44):**  So by the time I started from scratch, I knew exactly how I wanted to do that.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:49):**  A lot of people I've heard say things like, Oh, that, you know, that's really kind of  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:53):**  squishy consultant, these stuff or things like the values don't, don't matter that much.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:57):**  Why were they important to you, especially to do even before you hired your first employee?  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:03):**  So listen, I, I I'm one of these people that doesn't like the consultant stuff, right?  
**[0:14:07-0:14:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:07):**  Like I'm, I'm super biased against those things, but, but it's bullshit to think that starting

**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:16):**  It gives you a filter through which to consider people and opportunities.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:20):**  Right.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:21):**  I'll give you a simple example.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:22):**  Like in my last company, we needed people who were organized, right.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:25):**  I would go out to people's cars in the interview and say, let's look at your car.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:29):**  You know, like, let's just go outside and see if you're organized in the thing you drove  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:33):**  here.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:34):**  Like that's how you have to interview people for things.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:37):**  Right.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:38):**  And, and in this case, if you're going to be a believer in, in businesses that make,  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:43):**  you know, the environment better, let's start with who you are in your life.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:47):**  Like this is our mission.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:48):**  How do you fit into it?  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:49):**  I would look at people's LinkedIn profiles.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:51):**  If they had nothing in their interests or their careers that showed an inclination toward  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:56):**  that, it was a pretty strong bias against them.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:59):**  So that's the first reason.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:00):**  And especially in the early days of startup, it's retiring people, right.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:04):**  And the absolute worst experiences of all entrepreneurs have been bad hires.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:08):**  Like there's nothing more critical than that.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:10):**  And I guess the opposite of that is also true.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:13):**  But then the other is when you're making strategic decisions, if you don't have like, you know,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:17):**  this is your constitution, right.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:19):**  It's not detailed enough to apply to this day to day situation, but for the big decisions,  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:25):**  it's often important enough to look and say, is this getting us closer or farther from  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:29):**  our North star, from our core values and beliefs?  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:32):**  And that's, you know, my favorite times in business have always been when there's people  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:36):**  a couple levels below me arguing about, should we take the first door or the second door?  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:42):**  And they start talking about the core values and beliefs and they're arguing based on whether  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:46):**  door number one or door number two is going to get you further or closer to core values  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:50):**  and beliefs.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:51):**  And I just think you have to have that.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:52):**  And when stuff's hard and the startups, I think, you know, stuff's going to be super  
**[0:15:57-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:57):**  hard.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:58):**  You better have some purpose to get you through it.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:01):**  So if purpose and core values came first, what next?  
**[0:16:04-0:16:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:04):**  For Paul, it was networking.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:05):**  And in this case, networking meant going up and down Sand Hill Road.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:09):**  For those who don't know, Sand Hill is an actual road in Silicon Valley where a lot  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:12):**  of venture capital offices are.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:14):**  That was easy.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:16):**  Like some people have easy businesses.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:18):**  You know, that's not been my experience in my three companies.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:21):**  I haven't had a lot easy.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:23):**  So I don't want anyone to think that.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:24):**  Yeah, we decided we were going to raise venture capital in the beginning and I knew it was  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:28):**  a capital intensive business.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:30):**  It was a little bit hard in the beginning to know whether it had the scalability to  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:34):**  work in sort of venture model or not.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:36):**  By the way, looking back, I'm still not certain that it was exactly a round peg in a round  
**[0:16:41-0:16:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:41):**  hole.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:42):**  But nonetheless, when I raised it, there is a fun story.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:44):**  They raised like a $900,000 seed round that was proposed by a world-class angel investor.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:51):**  I would go up and down Sand Hill Road saying, I'm not raising capital.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:54):**  I'm looking for feedback, which turned out to be a great way to get in the doors of firms.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:59):**  And I was at Sequoia or somewhere, some really great firm that said, there's a guy out there  
**[0:17:04-0:17:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:04):**  you should meet.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:05):**  His name is Ali Partovi.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:07):**  And Ali and his brother had been founders of a couple of businesses that have been super  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:10):**  successful and been angel investors and like Zappos, Opower, Facebook.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:15):**  They were the greatest angel investors I could imagine at the time.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:19):**  I got to know them a little bit slowly and was still not raising money.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:23):**  And Ali at one point said, hey, I think you should do an angel or like a convertible note  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:28):**  round.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:29):**  I was like, oh, I'm going to do that.

**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:49):**  And that was really what ended up being a bridge to a series A that we did at the end  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:53):**  of 2011.

**[0:18:31-0:18:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:31):**  Oh, I don't think the word ag tech existed then.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:34):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:35):**  It was the least likely thing to work.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:38):**  It was, people had no idea what the hell I was talking about.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:41):**  All I had was like a PowerPoint and some models, right?  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:45):**  And myself.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:46):**  I mean, I remember being at Kleiner Perkins, watching a partner watch a video I'd created.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:51):**  I'd bartered with like a cousin of mine who made a video called the story of lettuce.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:55):**  It was this little animated video.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:57):**  And I remember standing behind him so I could see the video over the shoulder and the laptop  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:01):**  was like, I remember a shitty grimy dusty laptop.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:03):**  And I thought, I'm going to get a new laptop.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:05):**  Like that's, that's not going to work.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:06):**  And it just kept telling the story.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:10):**  You know, these guys were not, there was no way they were going to invest.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:14):**  Kleiner and Coastal were not going to invest in Bright Farms in 2011.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:18):**  But they got me into a lot of the places that needed to get to, to get where I was.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:24):**  So it wasn't in any way a waste of money.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:27):**  And in fact, those two firms, like I'm still very close with the little partners that I've  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:30):**  met a lot that way and collaborate with them all the time.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:34):**  Yeah, I love it.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:35):**  When you say they got you where you needed to go, do you mean like, you know, practice  
**[0:19:38-0:19:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:38):**  or actual intros?  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:39):**  Again, thinking of tips for entrepreneurs who maybe are listening.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:42):**  If you do get a no from an investor, you know, asking them for an intro to another or more  
**[0:19:45-0:19:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:45):**  about just building that relationship for the longterm.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:48):**  Yeah.

**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:56):**  There's nothing as clarifying as asking someone for money, right?  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:20:00):**  So you can tell someone, do you like my idea?  
**[0:20:03-0:20:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:20:03):**  Am I good looking?

**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:20:08):**  No.

**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:21:40):**  That was a beautiful partnership that turned out perfectly for the company.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:21:43):**  So that sort of journey worked out wonderfully.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:21:47):**  There were a lot of operational milestones as well and near-death experiences.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:21:53):**  We opened our first commercial greenhouse in 2013.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:21:56):**  We sort of built it in 2012, opened it in early 2013.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:01):**  I thought that I would hire the best growers in the world and I'd be off to the races.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:05):**  And that turned out to be wrong.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:07):**  The best growers in the world did not understand the category that I wanted to be in.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:12):**  They sort of wanted to, like all generals, they wanted to fight the last war that they'd  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:16):**  been in.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:17):**  And so they brought this expertise generally from other categories of the growth systems  
**[0:22:20-0:22:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:20):**  that didn't work.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:23):**  We wanted to have high velocity leafy greens and we wanted high velocity.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:28):**  And I mean, I mean, at store shelves, right?  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:30):**  High velocity was important because if you didn't have high velocity, you couldn't scale  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:34):**  with any sort of local presence.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:36):**  You could have low velocity and a lot of volume, but then you had to cover the half the country.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:42):**  I wanted to have lots of volume in a local market.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:45):**  And that had turned out to be very hard for the world's sort of greenhouse agriculture  
**[0:22:49-0:22:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:49):**  experts to get.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:50):**  And so we opened greenhouses with the best experts in the world and they failed.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:58):**  I used to joke, I still like to joke, like no one told us that OPEX was supposed to be  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:02):**  less than revenue in those early days.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:06):**  We had OPEX categories that were higher than our revenue.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:09):**  And so one of those amazingly clarifying moments again, like I had to go to my investors and  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:16):**  say we've made like a near fatal or maybe you could go a fatal mistake and we need more  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:22):**  capital to rip out these growth systems to throw good money after that and then it's  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:27):**  all going to work.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:28):**  And it's a natural question to say, but that's what you said last time.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:32):**  What's going to be different this time, right?  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:35):**  Basically that story was believed and it turned out to be the right story, right?  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:39):**  One of those board members told me maybe a year after we had proven that to be correct  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:44):**  that for him it was like such a on the line between should I do it or not do it?  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:49):**  He said, okay, we're going to do it and back you.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:52):**  But he did not have any sense of confidence in it.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:54):**  So he was basically saying, I'm super relieved that that worked out.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:01):**  And that was one of the most stressful years in my life, that summer of 2013.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:06):**  You had to do everything you could to make it work before you decided to throw in the  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:09):**  towel and try something different.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:10):**  And it was one of those things where I thought everybody's suffering.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:14):**  How can I do some of the worst suffering?  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:17):**  And we had a problem with mud on the floor of the greenhouse.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:20):**  And I thought, I'm going to be the guy that mucks the mud.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:22):**  I used to just drive to Pennsylvania, stay there for a few nights and everyone else would  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:26):**  go home in the evening and I would just stay and like sump pump out and squeegee mud.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:32):**  I love that Paul wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty, but more importantly, his willingness  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:36):**  to clean up the mud is an interesting insight into leadership and ego.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:40):**  Just because you've built a company and grown it doesn't mean the best CEO for the future  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:44):**  will always be you.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:45):**  And that can be a hard realization for anyone, especially a founder.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:50):**  In June of 2018, Cox Enterprises led our series D. And then they ended up, you know, a few  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:56):**  years later acquiring the rest of the company, which was a great thing for everybody because  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:01):**  they're a company that treats its people well and has a really strong reputation for treating  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:06):**  its people well.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:07):**  That was part of my due diligence was, would this be a good owner someday?  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:11):**  So during 2018, I started thinking about my role and the leadership team.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:17):**  It was time to scale to a degree that we hadn't scaled before.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:22):**  And I had never run a large company before.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:24):**  I was a guy who could get in front of anyone's board or any big companies, anything and sell  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:30):**  people on a dream.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:31):**  I could motivate people.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:33):**  I was terrific at strategy, I was terrific at capital raising.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:37):**  But the nuts and bolts of operating a complex, you know, we're almost like a manufacturer  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:42):**  with a complex biological process.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:45):**  Wasn't something I could do on my own.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:46):**  So I knew I needed like a partner in running the company.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:50):**  I had a really good coach.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:51):**  I still do it.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:52):**  And then I loved it, Michael Oberst, who has seen everything that could ever be seen and  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:58):**  who has and always had my back.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:00):**  And I remember we talked about what should we think about changing management?  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:04):**  What sort of partner could I bring on?  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:06):**  And he and I over the course of a year.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:09):**  So these are not quick decisions, right?  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:11):**  We would talk about this probably two or three times a month for a year.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:16):**  Sort of laid out the options, hire a COO to make the trends run on time, hire a president  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:21):**  to sort of run the company, but under my thumb, right?  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:25):**  Or hire a CEO who reports to the board and I step out of that line, right?  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:31):**  And what I realized, if I really analyze these three options and the three scenarios of the  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:36):**  future that they could bring us to, if I could take my ego out of the equation, the third  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:41):**  one was the best one.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:43):**  Because it would enable us to have such a better pool of candidates, right?  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:47):**  Like the greatest candidates in the world didn't want to be some underlying of a founder.

**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:58):**  And I created this whole thing.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:59):**  And eventually I decided that was the right thing to do and went and talked to my board  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:04):**  about it.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:05):**  And they were basically like, wow, very unusual.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:09):**  Founding CEOs almost never proposed such a thing, right?  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:14):**  And one of my investors had seen enough stuff that he'd said, he's like, I've done 75 deals  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:19):**  like this, maybe twice have I seen this and both times it works.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:23):**  He goes, so I'm supportive.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:24):**  I don't have a lot of pattern recognition, but two for two so far seems good.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:29):**  And so we decided to kick off the search and that took us nine or 10 months, I would say.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:36):**  And that was really me with the board.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:38):**  The main shareholders of course would have to believe in the candidate, but then I was  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:42):**  the one who sort of sold the candidate on why it was an awesome idea.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:46):**  And then went through the somewhat unusual and difficult process of bringing a guy in  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:51):**  to run my meetings with my team and my company and have me learn how to shut up and stand  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:57):**  back and let that happen, which I would say took me six months to not hate.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:02):**  But I again, learned to manage my ego.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:05):**  The guy we brought on as CEO's name is Steve Platt.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:08):**  I hug him when I see him now.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:11):**  We figured out how to work together.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:12):**  I love the dude and always will no matter what happens.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:15):**  And I can't recall feeling so good about decisions.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:19):**  That's amazing.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:20):**  And it must've been really hard to do.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:21):**  I mean, you mentioned ego there a couple of times.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:23):**  That stuff is not easy.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:25):**  Any tips or any things that you did on that journey to kind of get you to where you needed  
**[0:28:29-0:28:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:29):**  to get to?  
**[0:28:30-0:28:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:31):**  You know, I'm actually not a guy who struggles with his ego mostly, right?  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:36):**  But I'm still a person.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:38):**  So it's hard.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:39):**  I just remember like we'd have Tuesday leadership meetings and I just remember thinking this  
**[0:28:43-0:28:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:43):**  guy's doing things differently than I would do.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:46):**  And by the way, I wasn't rationally thinking he was doing it worse.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:49):**  It's just different, right?  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:50):**  And it would make me upset.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:53):**  And I'd sit there trying not to talk, thinking, why does this make me upset, right?  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:57):**  And I remember just struggling a little bit with how I could be in the room while this  
**[0:29:03-0:29:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:03):**  was happening when it wasn't making me feel good.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:06):**  I'm in a YPO forum.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:07):**  And one of my forum mates said something really smart.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:10):**  I was thinking through, and in the first six months I was like, maybe I'm not going to  
**[0:29:14-0:29:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:14):**  do this.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:15):**  Maybe I'm going to fly away.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:16):**  Like, you know, this is hard.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:18):**  Which is natural.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:19):**  It is hard.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:20):**  And I was thinking through like scenarios and I was like, well, this would be a good  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:23):**  one, medium one.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:24):**  This would be the worst case scenario.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:25):**  And one of my forum mates said that, no, no, the worst case scenario is if that guy failed.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:28):**  He goes, if that guy fails, he's screwed, of course, but you're really screwed because  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:33):**  you're the guy who kicked off this process, right?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:34):**  Like your investors aren't going to work hard to have you find the next one, right?  
**[0:29:40-0:29:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:40):**  And I thought that, I thought, oh, that's not intuitive.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:42):**  I hadn't thought about that.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:43):**  He said, no, yeah, you need him to succeed no matter what.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:46):**  So all of your choices should be viewed through the perspective of what would make him more  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:51):**  likely to succeed.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:52):**  And it was such a blinding insight and so smart that I just took it to heart.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:57):**  Every crossroads I came to, I would say, will this make Steve more likely to succeed?  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:02):**  And I would actually, I would just tell him that, like, this is how I'm approaching this.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:06):**  Like he'd say, oh, we're thinking about this or this and you doing this or not doing this.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:10):**  And I would say, okay, well, my lens is, will this be more likely to make you succeed?  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:15):**  And that actually being transparent about that and being authentic about it really enabled  
**[0:30:21-0:30:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:21):**  us to have a great working partnership together.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:24):**  That as I said, I think led to a friendship that will last as long as we're alive.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:30):**  That is so cool.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:31):**  I appreciate you sharing that.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:32):**  I don't think I've ever said that out loud, by the way.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:35):**  That was the first time I told that story.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:38):**  Another platform Paul is sharing his insights on is the Negative Foods newsletter, which  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:42):**  has some big ideas on the future of the food system.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:45):**  It's based on this thesis that food brands that have carbon neutral negative footprints  
**[0:30:51-0:30:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:51):**  are ascendant and that they will continue to be ascendant.

**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:31:01):**  portfolio of food offerings that include a bunch of foods that actually draw carbon from  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:31:07):**  the atmosphere.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:31:08):**  And when that happens, the food system could be a lever to reverse climate change.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:31:12):**  And I use that phrase lever consciously, recognizing that when people think about climate change,

**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:31:22):**  They don't start with food, even though, depending on who you ask, it's from 25 all the way up  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:31:28):**  by some estimates, like half of global greenhouse gas emissions related to food.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:31:33):**  Food is unique in that energy can be made carbon neutral.

**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:34:42):**  The fad is, and by the way, I'm not joking, like this is all brand new.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:34:46):**  Like if we go back to the 1930s, we were not fucking it up like we are now.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:34:51):**  And that's a blink of an eye in like the atmosphere and even humankind.  
**[0:34:57-0:34:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:34:57):**  This is all pretty new stuff.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:34:59):**  I do believe that there is an arc toward things getting better in the world, but not until  
**[0:35:04-0:35:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:35:04):**  you recognize that they're bad for us.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:35:06):**  And so we're upon that realization right now.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:35:09):**  And I don't doubt that society can make things better.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:35:13):**  Yes.

**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:35:17):**  to be part of that solution, that some of the established interests will be able to

**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:35:35):**  Big food companies are causing so much of the problems in the world.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:35:38):**  Boy, they're bad actors, right?

**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:36:13):**  to become regenerative, that's by far the fastest and most efficient way to do it.

**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:36:56):**  The Cisco's, the US Foods, the Baldor, they're all going to have to respond to it because

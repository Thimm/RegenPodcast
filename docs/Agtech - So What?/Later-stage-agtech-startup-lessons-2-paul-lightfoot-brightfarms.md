### Agtech - So What?  (2021-11-17)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  I'm Sarah Nolet.  Today, we're continuing our series on lessons from later-stage AgTech founders.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:12):**  And there are a lot of lessons from our very candid next guest.  I'm actually not a guy who struggles with his ego, mostly, right?  But I'm still a person, so it's hard.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:23):**  I just remember we'd have Tuesday leadership meetings, and I just remember thinking, this  guy's doing things differently than I would do.  And it would make me upset.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:32):**  And I'd sit there, try not to talk.  Why does this make me upset?  That's Paul Lightfoot, the founder and president of Bright Farms, who made the difficult decision  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:42):**  to voluntarily step back from the CEO role in the startup he founded for the overall  benefit of the company.  And as you'll hear, this transition was not easy.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:00:51):**  He had to get used to watching someone else steer the ship.  Looking back, Paul has made many tough decisions for Bright Farms in building it to become  a leading provider of locally grown packaged salads in the U.S. Paul came up with the idea  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:04):**  for Bright Farms back in 2011.  And now, 10 years later, the company has five hydroponic greenhouse farms, 300 employees,  and big plans to keep expanding sales.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:14):**  And just this year, Bright Farms was acquired by the global conglomerate Cox Enterprises.  So let's meet Paul.  I grew up in Southern California, went to college in Pennsylvania, law school in New  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:27):**  York City, and very briefly was like a white shoe Wall Street lawyer, which is, I think,  hard for people to imagine now.  It was a great experience.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:36):**  It wasn't my calling, pretty safe to say.  And I actually left when I was 28, not because I hated it, which is why everybody else left  and everybody, everyone that could would leave.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:46):**  I left it because my dad had been dying slowly and it was at the end of that period of our  lives.  This is a long time ago.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:01:52):**  I decided I wasn't going to be able to be present while I was working a thousand hours  a week.  And so I just went home, quit my job, went home and spent some time with my mom, with  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:01):**  my dad.  And when I was there, I had a couple of months to sort of think about what was next.  I was like, hey, it's late 90s.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:09):**  If there's ever a time in life to become an entrepreneur, all I have is a bike and it  wasn't even a valuable one.  I didn't have a mortgage.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:15):**  I didn't have a wife.  I didn't have anything slowing me down.  And I just came up with an idea for a startup, which was called Foodline, one word, Foodline,  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:24):**  very much like open table, but starting on the East Coast and fighting out from New York  to the rest of the country.  And just had a wild time, raised a bunch of money from American Express, the Zagat survey.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:35):**  Remember those little purple restaurant guidebooks and the Ticketmaster City Search division  of Barry Diller's IAC.  So just went from like being a lawyer to being an entrepreneur in like 30 seconds.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:46):**  Didn't know a thing, but I had a lot of energy and a lot of just a lot of energy.  How did you come up with that idea to go into that space?  Was that a sector you were covering or like to jump into that kind of food and restaurant  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:02:59):**  world?  I had worked in restaurants.  I was one of these like scrappy college kids working as a line cook and then a bartender  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:06):**  during law school in New York City.  But I think I was like collaborating with a chef.  We called him Chef Bob.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:12):**  He was a guy that was a chef at a restaurant I was bartending at while I was in law school.  And I think we actually said, let's try to come up with an idea.  I'm not one of these people that believes that you have to wait for lightning to strike.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:22):**  You sit down and you decide to find some lightning.  That's what writing is about.  So we just sat down and decided to come up with an idea, like the idea of being in the  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:31):**  restaurant space and just look for an area that things could be better with technology  and automating the reservation book and the customer information.  It turned out to be a great idea.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:42):**  We didn't win.  We actually ended up raising much money, grew like crazy, 23 cities, a few hundred employees  in like less than 24 months.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:03:50):**  It was breakneck, felt reckless, but that was what we had to do at that time.  Our board meetings, the KPIs were like salespeople hired and customers acquired.  Wasn't cash, wasn't salespeople and customers.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:05):**  And when the NASDAQ crashed, we were way too overextended.  We couldn't get a series C done and we wound it up.  And the transition for me then was a little bit lucky.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:15):**  Someone who had been watching me sort of thought I had some promise.  I was a kid.  I was 30 probably.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:22):**  This guy owned three businesses and two of them were in trouble.  And he basically said, why don't you come in and take one of the really shitty ones  and see if you can fix it.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:31):**  And it was a company that automated the distribution center operations of like mid-market retailers,  like the $2 billion size range retailers, like Jim Baree and Urban Outfitters.  PacSun was a customer of ours.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:43):**  There was a lot of apparel clients.  He said, you can shut it down, you can sell it, or you can fix it.  You just can't have any cash.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:04:51):**  I've been propping up payroll for like three years, no more cash.  And that was an amazingly narrow view to have in a way that was very useful.  Every dollar I spent, I collected for my customers.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:02):**  And so I just went out and met with my customers and talked them into doing new projects.  And I did that for about nine years.  And that was where I learned business, like quarter after quarter, managing to cashflow,  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:14):**  managing to receivables.  It was a very, very pure way to grow a business.  And that was really my 30s.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:21):**  It sounds like a sort of polar opposite to the startup experience in terms of kind of  how that ran.  What was hard about the startup experience?  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:29):**  I mean, probably wrapping it up and firing those people or what was challenging about  it or what were some of your takeaways?  I mean, I think the hard part was now I can see when there's something that has to be  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:40):**  done, it doesn't matter what the uncomfortable nature of it is.  You have to do it.  But when I was 30, I didn't necessarily understand that as clearly.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:05:49):**  And I had never been in a business like this.  Everybody that worked there was older than me.  I actually was intending to represent the owners and manage a president of the company.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:00):**  But when I sat down with him, he was like, here's the constraints.  Let's make this work.  He, that didn't believe me, was unwilling to see it for what it was.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:08):**  He had been the guy that had had his payrolls propped up for years.  And I was like, cash, it's all cash.  We're going to manage to weekly cash flows going forward.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:16):**  And we're going to, you and I are going to sit down on a whiteboard and map out weekly  cash flows, looking at six weeks.  And he just, he was just always putting assumptions in that were bullshit.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:27):**  J. Crew is going to come in for a $600,000 receivable in five weeks.  And I'd say, great.  When do you talk to him next?  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:33):**  And I would get on the phone with the sales guy and the J. Crew people were, they weren't  even close to buying.  And so eventually I said, you need to fix this or get out of the way.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:42):**  And he was like, Hey kid, you've got a lot to learn.  And I said, I am, I'm sure I do.  I'm here to learn in fact, but in the meantime, cash flow next week, cash flow the week after  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:06:52):**  next.  And I think if I was put back in that situation, I wouldn't have waited, you know, in hindsight,  it was probably five weeks until I let him go.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:00):**  I would have done it on the second day if I could go back.  Cause I can just see that stuff so much clearly now, pattern recognition is what I lacked  when I was 30.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:08):**  You know, and then it was, there were certain strategic things that looking back, I think  were quite obvious.  Like we were manufacturing hardware that we could buy off the market for lower, lower  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:19):**  costs and with better sort of functionality.  But we had a group of people that were building this hardware and designing the hardware.  And so this company didn't have the ability to see that that was a strategic mistake.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:30):**  And that probably took me like seven months to sort of execute on and looking back, that  was such an easy, blindingly easy insight to see if I went back and saw that again,  I would be like, Oh yeah, again, second day, like we're going to be generous in treating  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:44):**  those people well and asking them to move on to the rest of their careers.  But this company will fail if we manufacture a worst thing for higher costs than the rest  of the market enjoys.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:53):**  Yeah.  Super interesting.  And that kind of loss aversion, right?  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:07:56):**  It's such a part of human psychology.  Like it's already here and these people and they're doing it like we should find a way  to keep it.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:00):**  I think that's fascinating.  What's the other one.  I was just listening to a podcast about how we're really bad at subtraction.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:05):**  Like we, as humans try to fix problems by adding things.  And we rarely go to like, what if I just took this away, but in business, it's so key, right?  How do you cut your losses or how do you make those tough decisions?  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:14):**  Yeah.  I mean, that's like, I remember the founder of Intuit.  No, no, it was someone who came on to run Intuit after the founder had hired him, I  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:22):**  think.  And someone described how this guy, he would go into the department heads and be like,  what's your budget for next year?  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:28):**  And they'd be like, Oh, I'm going to, I'm going to go from 12 million to 14 and here's  why.  And he'd be like, no, no, no.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:33):**  I'm going to go from zero and just build up from there.  And that's it.  I think it always has to be zero budgeting.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:39):**  Like you have to start with as if there was nothing, what's our plan, right?  That's just how it has to be done.  So you were running the software slash hardware business.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:48):**  We still haven't gotten all the way to Bright Farms.  So what happened next?  So let's see.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:08:54):**  This was my thirties, right?  So I grew up as a business person in my thirties with that business.  But I also was like, if you can imagine a spectrum from like normal food people to super  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:03):**  weird food people, I was just making my way across that spectrum.  So I think like in college, I think I was, I remember like cooking food for my housemates  and they thought that was weird because I didn't go on and go.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:14):**  So I think I always had this like inclination to food.  I worked in tons of restaurants, but by the time I was in my early thirties, I started  making these connections between like my health and my food related lifestyle choices.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:27):**  And I can remember like very specific books and movies and like meeting with nutritionists  where I thought, oh, I'm not on the path I want to be on.  Right.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:36):**  And so I was just early to really early to organic early to local early to plant centric  eating.  And I started wishing near the end of my thirties that I had a career in food in a particular,  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:49):**  I could already see that my sort of personal mission was about food that was better for  the environment and better for health.  Right.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:09:56):**  And I was typecast by the world as like a software CEO.  This, you know, this is my second company is a technology CEO and I built a nice niche  in this like retail supply chain technology stuff.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:06):**  Right.  And I just decided I wanted to do something that had some religion in it, something that  had more purpose to it.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:13):**  And I just decided to leave.  And there were, I mean, there were other reasons with that company.  I'd sort of, I think I'd sort of reached my natural state to move on anyway.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:20):**  I was getting bored with what it was.  It wasn't that it wasn't fun to talk about it at cocktail parties.  And I'd like to have fun stories and fun things.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:28):**  And so I just started thinking about ideas like headhunters.  Weren't calling me with like, you know, sustainable local food companies.  They didn't exist.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:37):**  They didn't exist at the time.  It was like 2009, 2010.  I was thinking about this.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:40):**  And so I ended up developing the idea for Bright Farms inspired by a friend of mine  who had founded a renewable energy company called Sun Edison.  He had stayed at my house when they raised, he and Jigar Shah raised that first round  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:10:53):**  of capital from Goldman Sachs.  I remember taking the train in with him to the city when he was on that first meeting.  And he told me the business model and it was beautiful and elegant and it just stuck in  
**[0:11:03-0:11:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:03):**  my head.  And several years later, I just thought, what if I could apply that business model with  produce to food retailers?  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:11):**  And I found some guys that were doing like rooftop greenhouses for schools on like a  demonstration education scale.  And I gave him the idea.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:20):**  I think I built the deck and I gave him the idea.  He said, this is what you should do and I'll support you.  I'll be an investor.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:26):**  I'll be a board member.  And they were like, wow, big idea.  We like the idea.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:30):**  And they were like, but we're like the science philanthropy types.  Like we don't think we could sell to retailers.  We don't think it would raise capital.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:36):**  I remember the Ted Capolo, who was sort of the co-founder of the digital bright funds.  When he said that, I thought, those are the things that I can do.  Like I sell big projects to retailers and I love raising capital, you know, and I always  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:47):**  have.  And so I just decided I'm going to do it, but this is the part with the wife.  I brought the idea home and I said, Hey, it's time for the next startup.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:11:57):**  And she said, she literally just said, no, she said, you know, that was in your twenties.  Now you have a mortgage, three kids, you know, you're a software CEO.  And I was like, no, no, I was a software CEO.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:10):**  This is my calling.  And she's like, I'm not interested in calling.  And yet you did it anyways, and I'm sure she was supportive, but I think that point is  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:18):**  so interesting about like identities and that people, you know, we put each other in boxes.  Did you have to break the mold of being a software CEO yourself or kind of how you thought  of yourself to, to become a founder in this slightly different world?  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:30):**  Well, yeah, I mean, everybody suffers from the imposter syndrome when they're challenging  themselves.  Right.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:37):**  So, and I'm making myself sound like the bad guy here.  I conceded a slower on-ramp.  Like I did a few months, like maybe a half a year of consulting work while I was building  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:46):**  a business plan to raise some capital.  So I convinced her to let me do it.  She got me to concede sort of a less risky transition because I was, I was sort of all  
**[0:12:56-0:12:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:12:56):**  in and willing to embrace all risk.  I mean, she, she's an ass kicking executive on her own, right?  Like, so, and I was sort of like, Hey, you're the stable one.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:04):**  Why can't I take on the risk?  So that, that was a big part of it as well.  And so Paul officially began his Bright Farms journey, but this time he had experience as  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:13):**  an entrepreneur and more tools and tactics to draw on.  I knew what my leadership philosophies were.  I knew the sort of management culture and style the company was going to have.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:25):**  Before I even hired a single employee, I'd written out the core values and beliefs that  weren't even edited until nine years later.  And they're still 90% intact from the very beginning.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:35):**  Cause I just recognized how important it is to do that from the get-go.  I'd been, you know, I'd spent 15 years thinking about those things.  So by the time I started from scratch, I knew exactly how I wanted to do that.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:13:49):**  A lot of people I've heard say things like, Oh, that, you know, that's really kind of  squishy consultant, these stuff or things like the values don't, don't matter that much.  Why were they important to you, especially to do even before you hired your first employee?  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:03):**  So listen, I, I I'm one of these people that doesn't like the consultant stuff, right?  Like I'm, I'm super biased against those things, but, but it's bullshit to think that starting  with core values and beliefs is like consultant speak.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:16):**  It gives you a filter through which to consider people and opportunities.  Right.  I'll give you a simple example.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:22):**  Like in my last company, we needed people who were organized, right.  I would go out to people's cars in the interview and say, let's look at your car.  You know, like, let's just go outside and see if you're organized in the thing you drove  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:33):**  here.  Like that's how you have to interview people for things.  Right.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:38):**  And, and in this case, if you're going to be a believer in, in businesses that make,  you know, the environment better, let's start with who you are in your life.  Like this is our mission.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:48):**  How do you fit into it?  I would look at people's LinkedIn profiles.  If they had nothing in their interests or their careers that showed an inclination toward  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:14:56):**  that, it was a pretty strong bias against them.  So that's the first reason.  And especially in the early days of startup, it's retiring people, right.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:04):**  And the absolute worst experiences of all entrepreneurs have been bad hires.  Like there's nothing more critical than that.  And I guess the opposite of that is also true.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:13):**  But then the other is when you're making strategic decisions, if you don't have like, you know,  this is your constitution, right.  It's not detailed enough to apply to this day to day situation, but for the big decisions,  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:25):**  it's often important enough to look and say, is this getting us closer or farther from  our North star, from our core values and beliefs?  And that's, you know, my favorite times in business have always been when there's people  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:36):**  a couple levels below me arguing about, should we take the first door or the second door?  And they start talking about the core values and beliefs and they're arguing based on whether  door number one or door number two is going to get you further or closer to core values  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:50):**  and beliefs.  And I just think you have to have that.  And when stuff's hard and the startups, I think, you know, stuff's going to be super  
**[0:15:57-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:15:57):**  hard.  You better have some purpose to get you through it.  So if purpose and core values came first, what next?  
**[0:16:04-0:16:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:04):**  For Paul, it was networking.  And in this case, networking meant going up and down Sand Hill Road.  For those who don't know, Sand Hill is an actual road in Silicon Valley where a lot  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:12):**  of venture capital offices are.  That was easy.  Like some people have easy businesses.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:18):**  You know, that's not been my experience in my three companies.  I haven't had a lot easy.  So I don't want anyone to think that.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:24):**  Yeah, we decided we were going to raise venture capital in the beginning and I knew it was  a capital intensive business.  It was a little bit hard in the beginning to know whether it had the scalability to  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:34):**  work in sort of venture model or not.  By the way, looking back, I'm still not certain that it was exactly a round peg in a round  hole.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:42):**  But nonetheless, when I raised it, there is a fun story.  They raised like a $900,000 seed round that was proposed by a world-class angel investor.  I would go up and down Sand Hill Road saying, I'm not raising capital.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:16:54):**  I'm looking for feedback, which turned out to be a great way to get in the doors of firms.  And I was at Sequoia or somewhere, some really great firm that said, there's a guy out there  you should meet.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:05):**  His name is Ali Partovi.  And Ali and his brother had been founders of a couple of businesses that have been super  successful and been angel investors and like Zappos, Opower, Facebook.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:15):**  They were the greatest angel investors I could imagine at the time.  I got to know them a little bit slowly and was still not raising money.  And Ali at one point said, hey, I think you should do an angel or like a convertible note  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:28):**  round.  I was like, oh, I'm going to do that.  I'm going to do that.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:31):**  And I remember saying, okay, I would do that, but I'm not going to get out of bed for X.  Like if you let me throw in four other Xs alongside you, then we can do something that's  worth doing.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:46):**  And we did that, and I think it ended up being $900,000.  And that was really what ended up being a bridge to a series A that we did at the end  of 2011.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:17:54):**  That was sort of how these things always are.  Go out and kiss a bunch of frogs and calibrate your pitch based on the feedback that you're  getting.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:02):**  And it was great.  Found two co-leads of that round that were terrific and stuck with us for years and years  and years.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:10):**  I love it.  A couple of tips there.  One, to kind of have the conversations before you're raising.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:13):**  And then two, I mean, kiss a lot of frogs, qualifying investors to find those true believers  that are going to come on that journey.  Absolutely two tips that are super important.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:21):**  I've heard more recently and a little bit of experience that Sand Hill Road is a little  bit allergic to ag tech these days.  What was your experience then in talking about a farming company?  
**[0:18:31-0:18:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:31):**  Oh, I don't think the word ag tech existed then.  Oh yeah.  It was the least likely thing to work.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:37):**  Yeah.  It was, people had no idea what the hell I was talking about.  All I had was like a PowerPoint and some models, right?  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:45):**  And myself.  I mean, I remember being at Kleiner Perkins, watching a partner watch a video I'd created.  I'd bartered with like a cousin of mine who made a video called the story of lettuce.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:18:55):**  It was this little animated video.  And I remember standing behind him so I could see the video over the shoulder and the laptop  was like, I remember a shitty grimy dusty laptop.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:03):**  And I thought, I'm going to get a new laptop.  Like that's, that's not going to work.  And it just kept telling the story.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:10):**  You know, these guys were not, there was no way they were going to invest.  Kleiner and Coastal were not going to invest in Bright Farms in 2011.  But they got me into a lot of the places that needed to get to, to get where I was.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:24):**  So it wasn't in any way a waste of money.  And in fact, those two firms, like I'm still very close with the little partners that I've  met a lot that way and collaborate with them all the time.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:34):**  Yeah, I love it.  When you say they got you where you needed to go, do you mean like, you know, practice  or actual intros?  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:39):**  Again, thinking of tips for entrepreneurs who maybe are listening.  If you do get a no from an investor, you know, asking them for an intro to another or more  about just building that relationship for the longterm.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:48):**  Yeah.  If you get a no from an investor, that's a funny thing to say, right?  There's so many nos to be gotten in the world.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:19:54):**  I mean that they did give me a lot of feedback, right?  There's nothing as clarifying as asking someone for money, right?  So you can tell someone, do you like my idea?  
**[0:20:03-0:20:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:20:03):**  Am I good looking?  And people would be like, yeah, you're super good looking.  And then you say, can I have some money?  
**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:20:08):**  No.  Why?  And even then they might struggle to tell you you're ugly.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:20:11):**  They'll struggle to tell you that, right?  But that's the one time you get real answers from people is when you say, can I have your  money?  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:20:18):**  People then speak the truth.  People don't always speak enough of the truth, but they'll speak the truth then.  It was the introductions and the ideas mainly, right?  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:20:26):**  So tell me about the kind of, because zooming out and zooming forward, you guys raised quite  a bit of money and grew.  Like tell me about some of the milestones that you're really proud of in the Bright  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:20:34):**  Farms journey.  Yeah, well, we sort of graduated from venture to growth private equity along the way.  That was great.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:20:42):**  And we brought on investors in like 2016.  Our lead investor on our CVC was a firm called Catalyst investors, which had never done a  food deal.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:20:51):**  I was always talking to people who'd never done the food deals or active deals because  it was just too early in many ways.  And they were experts at technology companies getting from like this point to this point.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:21:03):**  They had a playbook for how to get from here to there.  And that was just great.  I mean, really, really, really, really helpful.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:21:10):**  And they also understood how to fill out the cap table in a thoughtful, strategic way.  It turned out that we had such capital requirements.  We were consuming capital at a rate that was hard for venture or growth private equity  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:21:24):**  investors on their own to be able to enable.  And our relationship with the company that eventually became our acquirer was that recognition  that there was a partnership between growth private equity and a strategic with a longer  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:21:37):**  term capital intensive sort of worldview.  That was a beautiful partnership that turned out perfectly for the company.  So that sort of journey worked out wonderfully.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:21:47):**  There were a lot of operational milestones as well and near-death experiences.  We opened our first commercial greenhouse in 2013.  We sort of built it in 2012, opened it in early 2013.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:01):**  I thought that I would hire the best growers in the world and I'd be off to the races.  And that turned out to be wrong.  The best growers in the world did not understand the category that I wanted to be in.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:12):**  They sort of wanted to, like all generals, they wanted to fight the last war that they'd  been in.  And so they brought this expertise generally from other categories of the growth systems  
**[0:22:20-0:22:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:20):**  that didn't work.  We wanted to have high velocity leafy greens and we wanted high velocity.  And I mean, I mean, at store shelves, right?  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:30):**  High velocity was important because if you didn't have high velocity, you couldn't scale  with any sort of local presence.  You could have low velocity and a lot of volume, but then you had to cover the half the country.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:42):**  I wanted to have lots of volume in a local market.  And that had turned out to be very hard for the world's sort of greenhouse agriculture  experts to get.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:22:50):**  And so we opened greenhouses with the best experts in the world and they failed.  I used to joke, I still like to joke, like no one told us that OPEX was supposed to be  less than revenue in those early days.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:06):**  We had OPEX categories that were higher than our revenue.  And so one of those amazingly clarifying moments again, like I had to go to my investors and  say we've made like a near fatal or maybe you could go a fatal mistake and we need more  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:22):**  capital to rip out these growth systems to throw good money after that and then it's  all going to work.  And it's a natural question to say, but that's what you said last time.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:32):**  What's going to be different this time, right?  Basically that story was believed and it turned out to be the right story, right?  One of those board members told me maybe a year after we had proven that to be correct  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:44):**  that for him it was like such a on the line between should I do it or not do it?  He said, okay, we're going to do it and back you.  But he did not have any sense of confidence in it.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:23:54):**  So he was basically saying, I'm super relieved that that worked out.  And that was one of the most stressful years in my life, that summer of 2013.  You had to do everything you could to make it work before you decided to throw in the  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:09):**  towel and try something different.  And it was one of those things where I thought everybody's suffering.  How can I do some of the worst suffering?  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:17):**  And we had a problem with mud on the floor of the greenhouse.  And I thought, I'm going to be the guy that mucks the mud.  I used to just drive to Pennsylvania, stay there for a few nights and everyone else would  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:26):**  go home in the evening and I would just stay and like sump pump out and squeegee mud.  I love that Paul wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty, but more importantly, his willingness  to clean up the mud is an interesting insight into leadership and ego.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:40):**  Just because you've built a company and grown it doesn't mean the best CEO for the future  will always be you.  And that can be a hard realization for anyone, especially a founder.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:24:50):**  In June of 2018, Cox Enterprises led our series D. And then they ended up, you know, a few  years later acquiring the rest of the company, which was a great thing for everybody because  they're a company that treats its people well and has a really strong reputation for treating  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:06):**  its people well.  That was part of my due diligence was, would this be a good owner someday?  So during 2018, I started thinking about my role and the leadership team.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:17):**  It was time to scale to a degree that we hadn't scaled before.  And I had never run a large company before.  I was a guy who could get in front of anyone's board or any big companies, anything and sell  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:30):**  people on a dream.  I could motivate people.  I was terrific at strategy, I was terrific at capital raising.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:37):**  But the nuts and bolts of operating a complex, you know, we're almost like a manufacturer  with a complex biological process.  Wasn't something I could do on my own.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:46):**  So I knew I needed like a partner in running the company.  I had a really good coach.  I still do it.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:25:52):**  And then I loved it, Michael Oberst, who has seen everything that could ever be seen and  who has and always had my back.  And I remember we talked about what should we think about changing management?  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:04):**  What sort of partner could I bring on?  And he and I over the course of a year.  So these are not quick decisions, right?  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:11):**  We would talk about this probably two or three times a month for a year.  Sort of laid out the options, hire a COO to make the trends run on time, hire a president  to sort of run the company, but under my thumb, right?  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:25):**  Or hire a CEO who reports to the board and I step out of that line, right?  And what I realized, if I really analyze these three options and the three scenarios of the  future that they could bring us to, if I could take my ego out of the equation, the third  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:41):**  one was the best one.  Because it would enable us to have such a better pool of candidates, right?  Like the greatest candidates in the world didn't want to be some underlying of a founder.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:26:53):**  And it took so long to figure out how to put my ego in a box because I'm human, right?  And I created this whole thing.  And eventually I decided that was the right thing to do and went and talked to my board  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:04):**  about it.  And they were basically like, wow, very unusual.  Founding CEOs almost never proposed such a thing, right?  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:14):**  And one of my investors had seen enough stuff that he'd said, he's like, I've done 75 deals  like this, maybe twice have I seen this and both times it works.  He goes, so I'm supportive.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:24):**  I don't have a lot of pattern recognition, but two for two so far seems good.  And so we decided to kick off the search and that took us nine or 10 months, I would say.  And that was really me with the board.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:38):**  The main shareholders of course would have to believe in the candidate, but then I was  the one who sort of sold the candidate on why it was an awesome idea.  And then went through the somewhat unusual and difficult process of bringing a guy in  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:27:51):**  to run my meetings with my team and my company and have me learn how to shut up and stand  back and let that happen, which I would say took me six months to not hate.  But I again, learned to manage my ego.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:05):**  The guy we brought on as CEO's name is Steve Platt.  I hug him when I see him now.  We figured out how to work together.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:12):**  I love the dude and always will no matter what happens.  And I can't recall feeling so good about decisions.  That's amazing.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:20):**  And it must've been really hard to do.  I mean, you mentioned ego there a couple of times.  That stuff is not easy.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:25):**  Any tips or any things that you did on that journey to kind of get you to where you needed  to get to?  Yeah.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:31):**  You know, I'm actually not a guy who struggles with his ego mostly, right?  But I'm still a person.  So it's hard.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:39):**  I just remember like we'd have Tuesday leadership meetings and I just remember thinking this  guy's doing things differently than I would do.  And by the way, I wasn't rationally thinking he was doing it worse.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:49):**  It's just different, right?  And it would make me upset.  And I'd sit there trying not to talk, thinking, why does this make me upset, right?  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:28:57):**  And I remember just struggling a little bit with how I could be in the room while this  was happening when it wasn't making me feel good.  I'm in a YPO forum.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:07):**  And one of my forum mates said something really smart.  I was thinking through, and in the first six months I was like, maybe I'm not going to  do this.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:15):**  Maybe I'm going to fly away.  Like, you know, this is hard.  Which is natural.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:19):**  It is hard.  And I was thinking through like scenarios and I was like, well, this would be a good  one, medium one.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:24):**  This would be the worst case scenario.  And one of my forum mates said that, no, no, the worst case scenario is if that guy failed.  He goes, if that guy fails, he's screwed, of course, but you're really screwed because  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:33):**  you're the guy who kicked off this process, right?  Like your investors aren't going to work hard to have you find the next one, right?  And I thought that, I thought, oh, that's not intuitive.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:42):**  I hadn't thought about that.  He said, no, yeah, you need him to succeed no matter what.  So all of your choices should be viewed through the perspective of what would make him more  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:29:51):**  likely to succeed.  And it was such a blinding insight and so smart that I just took it to heart.  Every crossroads I came to, I would say, will this make Steve more likely to succeed?  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:02):**  And I would actually, I would just tell him that, like, this is how I'm approaching this.  Like he'd say, oh, we're thinking about this or this and you doing this or not doing this.  And I would say, okay, well, my lens is, will this be more likely to make you succeed?  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:15):**  And that actually being transparent about that and being authentic about it really enabled  us to have a great working partnership together.  That as I said, I think led to a friendship that will last as long as we're alive.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:30):**  That is so cool.  I appreciate you sharing that.  I don't think I've ever said that out loud, by the way.

Another platform Paul is sharing his insights on is the Negative Foods newsletter, which  has some big ideas on the future of the food system.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:30:45):**  It's based on this thesis that food brands that have carbon neutral negative footprints  are ascendant and that they will continue to be ascendant.  And when consumers start choosing foods based on their carbon footprints, we will find a  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:31:01):**  portfolio of food offerings that include a bunch of foods that actually draw carbon from  the atmosphere.  And when that happens, the food system could be a lever to reverse climate change.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:31:12):**  And I use that phrase lever consciously, recognizing that when people think about climate change,  they're often thinking about energy and transportation and buildings, let's say, right?  They don't start with food, even though, depending on who you ask, it's from 25 all the way up  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:31:28):**  by some estimates, like half of global greenhouse gas emissions related to food.  Food is unique in that energy can be made carbon neutral.  If we replace all the fossil fuels with all wind or water power or next-gen nuclear, you  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:31:46):**  can get it to neutral, but it never gets better than neutral, right?  So it's in balance.  It's not releasing anymore greenhouse gases.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:31:54):**  But with food, if you do it right, I contend that you can actually have it be negative,  where the emissions are less than the amount of carbon that's drawn from the atmosphere.  And so that, along with the fact that people eat all day every day, makes food a super  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:32:08):**  fun place and interesting place to be if you're thinking about ways that we can not only get  to neutral, but can start pulling some of the carbon out of the atmosphere.  One of the pushbacks, and we've talked about this before, is we've seen various trends  
**[0:32:21-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:32:21):**  in food.  And you mentioned a few local, organic.  There's a bunch of things that people want, and they come in and out of fashion.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:32:28):**  And there's lots of intention behind them for them to be good for the world, but they  go out of fashion.  And that's one of the challenges.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:32:34):**  How do you see this being different than some of those other movements?  I love the question.  I see this different in terms of how important it is, right?  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:32:43):**  It's like a fundamental part of society, right?  I believe, and I think I'm right, that society is going to reverse climate change, period.  And by the way, if we don't take the steps to do so, the steps will be taken without  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:33:00):**  us.  It's going to happen one way or another, whether humans figure it out or whether the next set  of dinosaurs figure it out with mother nature applying her own methods, right?  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:33:09):**  It's going to get figured out.  I'm optimistic that humans will figure it out.  And when we do figure it out, it's going to be a little bit of how that book by Bill Gates,  
**[0:33:18-0:33:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:33:18):**  How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, talks about.  There's a bunch of categories.  There's a bunch of trajectories.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:33:24):**  Do them faster and better, and do all of them until it's been done, right?  And if we do think about society doing all the things that it takes to survive, which  involves reversing climate change, this has to be part of that solution.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:33:39):**  I'm not a big silver bullet guy.  I've always been shooting a lot of land bullets as fast as I can, running.  I love it.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:33:48):**  But there's another reason though, right?  Like the fad of let's use a fad, right?  Let's not eat fats with a stupid nutrition fad, right?  
**[0:33:58-0:34:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:33:58):**  Well, yeah, people should avoid fats and they'll be skinnier and healthier, right?  That turned out to be wrong.  And like all of the nutrition experts in the world told us that was the case.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:34:08):**  And I still go into people's refrigerators and they have 2% milk for their kids.  And I'm like, why do you have 2% milk?  Oh, it's got less fat.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:34:15):**  And I'm like, that was 20 years ago that we realized that was a bad idea, right?  So there are lots of examples of fads in food that are bad and have gone bad, regenerative  practices.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:34:26):**  That's not a new fad.  That's what the indigenous people in the plains with the bison were doing it for thousands  and thousands of years, right?  
**[0:34:35-0:34:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:34:35):**  I would say that the fad is growing corn using natural gas for ethanol production.  The fad is, and by the way, I'm not joking, like this is all brand new.  Like if we go back to the 1930s, we were not fucking it up like we are now.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:34:51):**  And that's a blink of an eye in like the atmosphere and even humankind.  This is all pretty new stuff.  I do believe that there is an arc toward things getting better in the world, but not until  
**[0:35:04-0:35:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:35:04):**  you recognize that they're bad for us.  And so we're upon that realization right now.  And I don't doubt that society can make things better.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:35:13):**  Yes.  And I think part of what you believe in and I would agree with is that entrepreneurs need  to be part of that solution, that some of the established interests will be able to  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:35:21):**  move the needle and they're big ships that have to turn a little bit, but some of this  needs to come through new entrance.  Tell me about some of the opportunities that you're seeing in some of the areas you're  
**[0:35:29-0:35:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:35:29):**  excited about.  Yeah.  Well, let me agree with you in a really emphatic way.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:35:35):**  Big food companies are causing so much of the problems in the world.  Boy, they're bad actors, right?  But I don't want to get rid of them, right?  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:35:42):**  If we think about all the foods, let's say all the trucks delivering food out there,  let's use US Foods as an example, thousands of trucks delivering foods to restaurants  all over the country, it would be asinine to say, we're going to dissolve them and create  
**[0:35:55-0:35:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:35:55):**  a hundred new companies that are going to start to prescribe.  So it would be an amazing waste of resources.  It would be an amazing waste of capital.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:36:03):**  If instead we got US Foods the right incentives and the right motivations, like consumer demand,  so that they transform their fleet to become renewable, so they transform the supply chain  to become regenerative, that's by far the fastest and most efficient way to do it.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:36:17):**  So I intend to embrace big food in the journey.  But part of the solution to that is that they have to lose battles over and over again to  startups, right?  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:36:27):**  They have to have their lunches eaten in order to feel those motivations and to feel those  incentives, right?  So I hope and I'm confident we will see a company like 4P Foods, which disclaimer I'm  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:36:39):**  an investor in, start to carve out a major part of the mid-Atlantic market share for  food service because they're connecting the regenerative farms with the thoughtful food  service companies, with the corporate cafeterias that want to buy local and regeneratively  
**[0:36:52-0:36:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:36:52):**  produced food.  And when they do that, they'll be a successful company.  The Cisco's, the US Foods, the Baldor, they're all going to have to respond to it because  
**[0:37:00-0:37:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:37:00):**  that's what their customers want.  But it does take entrepreneurs to win in the market for the big food companies, I think,  to move fast enough.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:37:07):**  So I want there to be some bloodshed.  I want there to be some battles lost to startups.  But in the long run, a lot of these startups will get acquired by big food companies.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:37:16):**  And that's a beautiful, wonderful thing.  It makes the capital cycles work and it's what will enable them to change the whole  battleship of it.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:37:25):**  Earlier lever for change Paul also wants to see pulled is around food labeling.  He says once food brands can tell their carbon footprint stories to consumers, we'll see  a shift in the whole food supply chain, including for farmers.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:37:37):**  I wrote this like three part series on carbon labeling.  And when I started writing it, I thought it would end with like, I'd put a bow around  like a neat story.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:37:46):**  This is how it's going to play out at Predict the Future.  And unfortunately, it didn't happen.  Like the first edition was like carbon labeling failed.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:37:52):**  This is why it failed.  This is why it's going to succeed in the future.  The second edition was like shining a spotlight on Unilever and Quarn and some European companies  
**[0:38:00-0:38:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:38:00):**  that were early adopters.  And the third edition was like an inventory of the dog's breakfast that carbon labeling  is right now.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:38:08):**  It's a total shit show.  And it can't be a shit show.  If we don't define what regenerative means, it's going to be useless.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:38:15):**  It'll be like natural is today.  It doesn't mean anything.  If we don't find a way for consumers to make choices based on carbon footprints, the food  
**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:38:23):**  companies, the food brands, both the big food companies, but also the startups that are  going to eat their lunches, they won't be able to win based on their carbon footprints.  And that's what we need to have happen.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:38:33):**  We need to see brand A kick the ass of brand B because it's carbon negative and brand B  isn't.  And when you start to see that happening in category after category, then you start to  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:38:42):**  see all these supply chains shifting and the farms will start adopting regenerative practices  to chase the market forces essentially.  So I think that carbon labeling mechanism, tool, or that there's like a gap in the middle  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms#t=0:38:55):**  of that, that is where I would like to see the world's best entrepreneurs making a huge  difference as soon as possible.  And that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.

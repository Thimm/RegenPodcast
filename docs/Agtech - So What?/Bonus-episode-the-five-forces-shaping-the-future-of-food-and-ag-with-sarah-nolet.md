**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:00:14):**  You're probably wondering where Sarah is.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:00:16):**  Well, you're about to hear from her shortly.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:00:19):**  This is one of her recent talks about the future forces shaping food and agriculture.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:00:24):**  Sarah gave this talk at the Digital Innovation and Smart Agriculture Festival near Mynock  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:00:28):**  of the Woods in Hamilton in beautiful Southwest Victoria.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:00:32):**  Here Sarah outlines five forces impacting food and ag and how they'll be a catalyst  
**[0:00:37-0:00:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:00:37):**  for innovation and broader societal change.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:00:40):**  This talk is based on research Sarah and the Agthentic team did for Agri-Futures, also  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:00:45):**  with the help of the Institute for the Future.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:00:47):**  I'll let Sarah take the stage.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:00:51):**  But I want to start with this picture and a little bit of a story around innovation.  
**[0:00:56-0:00:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:00:56):**  So if you see the picture on the left and the picture on the right, these are both New  
**[0:00:59-0:01:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:00:59):**  York City.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:01:00):**  One is in 1905 and one is in 2015.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:01:04):**  And of course, on the left you see horse drawn carriages and on the right you see cars.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:01:08):**  But that is not the story of disruption that I want to tell you about today.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:01:11):**  It's a story of disruption you've probably heard before.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:01:14):**  What I want to draw your attention to is if you look closely, you'll see it's not just  
**[0:01:18-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:01:18):**  the type of vehicle that's on the road that distinguishes these two photos.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:01:25):**  It's how our whole lived experience has changed as a result of the automobile.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:01:31):**  So it's the network of traffic lights, it's parking spaces, it's shrunken sidewalks, it's  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:01:36):**  automobile oriented businesses, car dealerships that we see now that we didn't have in the  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:01:41):**  past.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:01:42):**  Today, over half of modern American cities land is dedicated to streets and roads and  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:01:46):**  parking lots and service stations and all these things that exist now as a result of  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:01:51):**  the automobile.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:01:52):**  So it's the infrastructure that stemmed from this initial disruption that's changed.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:01:57):**  And it's not just in major metropolitan cities.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:01:59):**  We see freeways and fueling stations, parking lots, drive-through foods.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:02:04):**  In the U.S. now, something like 20% of meals are eaten in the car, which obviously wasn't  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:02:09):**  possible previously if you didn't have drive-throughs.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:02:13):**  So what I want to highlight here is how one initial technology can cause a whole change  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:02:18):**  over a period of over 100 years to the infrastructure in how we live.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:02:24):**  And really this is happening, this same transformative power of automobiles that was unlocked through  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:02:31):**  these infrastructure linkages is similar to what's happening today.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:02:35):**  We're seeing technology, digital technologies, transform our world and transform food and  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:02:39):**  agriculture.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:02:41):**  What's again happening is not just this one initial technology, it's not just sensors,  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:02:45):**  it's not just artificial intelligence, but it's actually that these technologies are  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:02:49):**  transforming the infrastructure, this connected infrastructure around how we live and operate.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:02:54):**  So we're seeing massive growth in internet connected devices.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:02:58):**  Of course, many of you have one of those in your pocket that now helps us order transportation  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:03:02):**  or food or organize our farms or lives.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:03:05):**  We're seeing growth in artificial intelligence, including in agriculture and growing computing  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:03:10):**  power and resources behind that that are enabling us to grow these technologies and the infrastructure  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:03:15):**  that sits around them.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:03:18):**  And this is one of the many forces that we see impacting agriculture.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:03:23):**  We call this interconnected digital infrastructure.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:03:26):**  It's just one thing shaping our world today inside and outside of food and agriculture,  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:03:31):**  these interconnected systems of digital capabilities that are playing out across the ag supply  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:03:35):**  chain.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:03:37):**  So as you heard before, I'm Sarah Nollet and I'm the co-founder of the Agfentik Group and  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:03:41):**  our mission is to enable innovative agriculture for global impact.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:03:45):**  We spend all of our time across Tenacious Ventures, our venture capital firm investing  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:03:50):**  in early stage startups, building this future and Agfentik Advisory, our advisory firm where  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:03:54):**  we work with industry bodies, government and private companies on building the future of

**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:04:04):**  So What, where we tell the stories of non-traditional innovators.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:04:08):**  All of this means we spend 100% of our time thinking about the future of agriculture.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:04:13):**  And so while I was going to talk to you today about some specific technologies and some  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:04:17):**  of the opportunities we're seeing, I actually think that focusing on technology alone misses  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:04:23):**  what I think is the bigger picture and a much more important message for Hamilton and for  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:04:27):**  all of you to hear today.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:04:29):**  So while I can't predict the future, what we're starting to see is signals of what it  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:04:33):**  might look like.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:04:34):**  And it's really clear that technology is just one tiny piece of what we'll need and what  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:04:39):**  we'll need to be ready for in the future.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:04:43):**  Because interconnected digital infrastructure is just one of the many forces impacting the  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:04:48):**  world around us.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:04:49):**  There's at least four others that we found in some recent work with Agri-Futures.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:04:53):**  And I want to talk to you about how these forces are shaping the world around us, including  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:04:57):**  in food and agriculture.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:04:59):**  So first I'll go through each of these forces and then I'll talk a little bit about what  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:05:03):**  you can do, whether you're a producer, an entrepreneur, a policy maker, or just someone  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:05:08):**  who lives in and around Hamilton who might eat food every now and then to thrive in this  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:05:13):**  increasingly complex future.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:05:15):**  So we've talked about interconnected digital infrastructure.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:05:18):**  Let's have a little bit of a look at the other four.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:05:22):**  This second force we call viral disinformation in the food system.

**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:06:46):**  We're one of the top five countries that has seen a big drop in trust in technology in

**[0:06:56-0:06:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:06:56):**  It's not all doom and gloom.

**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:07:02):**  we build trust, especially in food and agriculture with our consumers.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:07:06):**  That's at the local level, the brand level, the national level.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:07:09):**  So there's many opportunities here we see with this force.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:07:13):**  The third force is what we call new geographies of climate change.

**[0:07:34-0:07:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:07:34):**  And migration, like you see here, is one strategy.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:07:36):**  We're already seeing this, and I'm sure you guys have many examples in the room there

**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:07:51):**  a winter crop or vice versa or having both.

**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:07:59):**  Internationally, we're seeing this especially in fisheries, which I think is a fascinating  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:08:03):**  example.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:08:04):**  Fish stocks are moving as a result of climate change and water temperatures.

**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:08:12):**  there anymore, can you fish in other jurisdictions?  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:08:15):**  And if you do, what happens to the processing assets that you had near that fishery or other  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:08:20):**  international jurisdiction issues?

**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:08:27):**  about technology, that aren't just about climate.

**[0:08:34-0:08:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:08:34):**  this forest is increasingly complex.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:08:37):**  So again, there are many opportunities here to capitalize on newly suitable regions to  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:08:42):**  grow new and different things, to capture new revenue streams.

**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:08:49):**  And again, that in itself is an opportunity.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:08:53):**  The fourth force we see is what we call rewiring the grid.

**[0:08:59-0:09:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:08:59):**  on agriculture and regional communities.

**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:09:06):**  renewable and alternative energies.

**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:09:17):**  and all of us to accelerate that transition and be more environmentally and socially friendly.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:09:23):**  These compliance requirements from the big capital providers are driving new investments

**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:09:32):**  storage and for land is not in big cities where we've already occupied the land, but

**[0:09:43-0:09:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:09:43):**  we have today.

**[0:10:01-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:10:01):**  in 2017 and nearly 7 billion in 2019 invested into animal and plant biotechnology.

**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:13:29):**  and fiber and particularly our lamb to see if we can do something better for our community.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:13:34):**  So she decided to make a lamb sausage roll using what she produces on her farm, their  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:13:40):**  fat lambs and took them to the local, I think it was a football game, a thousand lamb sausage

**[0:13:54-0:13:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:13:54):**  for our product.

**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:13:58):**  sold it previously or are there new opportunities to think of different supply chains and different  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:14:04):**  end consumers.

**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:14:22):**  What she found was actually it was people in her local community and they wanted things  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:14:25):**  that she didn't actually think they would like preservative free products or sustainable  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:14:31):**  packaging.

**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:14:36):**  what she actually produces, how that might impact the farm, how that might impact the  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:14:40):**  Outback lamb brand.

**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:14:47):**  sales, she's creating whole new value chains for that lamb product.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:14:53):**  For her that's meant she's taking a $250 carcass to over $400 per animal.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:14:58):**  So a 60% increase in carcass value.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:15:00):**  And she's really early on this journey.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:15:01):**  It's only a small percentage of her lamb that she sells in this new value chain, but it's

**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:17:48):**  proving that out.

**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:18:05):**  No one wants compost bins with maggots crawling over it anywhere.

**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:18:28):**  have potentially livestock feed, pet food, and even human food, depending on what's produced

**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:18:39):**  When we think of waste and when waste gets talked about in the media, we kind of think

**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:18:45):**  These clean organics, you know, a pile of tomatoes or apples sitting there looking all

**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:18:51):**  But in reality, waste looks a lot more like this picture in the middle.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:18:55):**  This is an actual bin load coming to Go Terra from one of their clients.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:18:59):**  Doesn't play there is very much food there.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:19:02):**  You guys can tell it's a lot more plates and chopsticks and forks and things like that.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:19:06):**  So this is really what waste looks like.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:19:08):**  And actually even can look like this.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:19:11):**  These are things that Go Terra has actually seen and processed in their facility.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:19:15):**  Nappies, forks, plates, bones, some kind of dinosaur bone, even it's come from one of

**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:19:28):**  We can't just think about changing consumer behavior because all of us don't want to go  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:19:32):**  through the work of separating out different kinds of food waste.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:19:35):**  And so while that's something maybe we could aspire to change, what's actually going to  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:19:38):**  be more impactful is building new infrastructure.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:19:41):**  So this is one of the Go Terra units.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:19:43):**  This one is sitting in the basement of Lend Lease in Sydney, managing all of the waste

**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:19:54):**  future and the kind of new infrastructure that's possible to have a positive impact  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:19:58):**  on climate change because it diverts waste from landfill.

**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:20:06):**  We're not trucking waste out to a landfill, which can be massively important because our

**[0:20:15-0:20:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:20:15):**  But this is just one kind of new infrastructure.

**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:20:24):**  And that's led to what we call dark stores or these warehouses that don't have any kind

**[0:21:09-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:21:09):**  far away or maybe it's not.

**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:21:22):**  Should we have trellis trees?

**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:21:33):**  So this entrance of new infrastructure and the impact that we'll have means we can optimize  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:21:38):**  production systems for these new automated supply chains.

**[0:22:03-0:22:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:22:03):**  will also question traditional roles and identities of what it means to work in agriculture and  
**[0:22:08-0:22:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:22:08):**  to be a farmer.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:22:10):**  So I have two stories here.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:22:11):**  On the left, you see a farmer named Murray Scholes and he farms with his wife, Emma in  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:22:15):**  Southern New South Wales on the foothills of the snowy mountains.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:22:19):**  And they've largely for most of their time been grain producers.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:22:23):**  But a few years ago, Murray went to Switzerland and he was walking through the beautiful Swiss  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:22:27):**  Alps and saw to his surprise, a few farms.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:22:30):**  Now these are farms with like two cows or one cow.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:22:34):**  And he thought, how could these possibly be commercial farms that actually supply milk  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:22:38):**  to anyone when they only have less than five cows?  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:22:41):**  And what he realized was the government was actually paying these farmers to perform this  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:22:45):**  service of creating this beautiful iconic Swiss landscape.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:22:49):**  And so they actually have a different revenue stream in addition to maybe their milk sales.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:22:53):**  They also have this income stream of producing this benefit for society.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:22:58):**  And that got Murray thinking about, well, what is he not producing today that he could  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:02):**  be producing or what kind of identity of himself and of their farm might he need to challenge?  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:07):**  And he started looking across his farm and one of the big problems he was having was  
**[0:23:11-0:23:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:11):**  herbicide resistance in his grain operation.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:13):**  He was trying everything, different kinds of optical spraying technologies and different  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:17):**  chemicals and cocktails and timings, and just nothing was working.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:20):**  And he had always said his whole life that he just didn't want to farm sheep.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:23):**  He's a grain guy and that's what he wants to farm.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:25):**  But he started to look over at his neighbor who did have sheep and they were running them  
**[0:23:29-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:29):**  in the crops to eat the weeds.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:30):**  And that was helping with the weed management problem.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:33):**  And so a couple of things just clicked into place and Murray said, well, I guess I need  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:37):**  to become a sheep producer.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:38):**  And so he did bring sheep into the operation, got someone on board to manage them, help  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:42):**  with the weed problem and created a new revenue stream.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:45):**  And this going all the way back to his journey to Switzerland was unlocked because of a change  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:49):**  in his identity.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:50):**  He'd always wanted to be a grain producer, but now he's a mixed farmer and they also  
**[0:23:54-0:23:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:54):**  run beef cattle as well as those prime lambs.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:23:56):**  So that's one example of this change in identity that this complex future can drive.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:24:01):**  Stu Austin and his family on the right here, we're in the news a bit recently, you might

**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:24:10):**  Yes, that's Microsoft that makes teams, the software that I'm dialing in on today.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:24:14):**  And they bought carbon credits from his farm in New South Wales that he produced and monitored

**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:24:29):**  new markets, new demands from consumers that starts to challenge the identity of what it

**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:30:16):**  And why would we assume that the tastiest thing to eat was actually the easiest to domesticate?  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:30:20):**  So Vow's approach is to start with any animal and you see some of them there.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:30:24):**  Maybe it's a zebra, maybe it's a turtle.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:30:26):**  So some of the food that they've created is not maybe what you'd expect.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:30:30):**  They've got a goat cheeseburger slider.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:30:32):**  They've got pork and prawn cutlet.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:30:33):**  They've got kangaroo crystal dumplings, alpaca chili, rabbit tart with peas and mushrooms,  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:30:39):**  or a lamb glassy scallop.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:30:40):**  So different kinds of examples of food challenging the traditional categories of what we think,  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:30:46):**  that a burger is made with hamburger that comes from cows.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:30:49):**  And this is what I want to highlight because this is what Vow is just one example of, the  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:30:53):**  blending of these different products, whether that's cellular agriculture and traditional  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:30:58):**  meat, like we see with the pork and prawn cutlet, where the pork maybe comes from cel  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:01):**  ag and the prawn comes from actual prawns, or even rethinking flavor and form and how  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:07):**  they relate, like the lamb glassy scallop.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:10):**  Well, maybe it's lamb grown in a lab, but the texture is actually like a scallop.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:15):**  So completely mind blowing stuff that we can do as we precisely control the inputs at this  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:20):**  level.

**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:22):**  From the bottom, we're seeing already gone to market in the US by Tyson Foods, a blended  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:27):**  beef burger.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:28):**  So the benefits of plant-based burgers, however you might think about them, with the benefits  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:32):**  of beef-based burgers combined into one, targeting flexitarians who might want to lower their  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:36):**  intake of beef.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:38):**  So a blended product that's already on the shelves in the US.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:41):**  But breaking these boundaries doesn't stop there.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:43):**  We also see examples like in the middle, we have a chicken spinach leaf.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:46):**  So this is a spinach leaf that's been de-celled to become the scaffold or the bones on which  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:52):**  these cell ag products can grow, in this case, chicken.  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:56):**  So it's mind blowing, right?  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:31:57):**  We've got spinach that tastes like chicken that's grown in a lab.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:32:01):**  And it's just one example of how we're challenging the traditional categories of what it's meant  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:32:06):**  to produce something and grow something and have it end up in consumers' hands.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:32:10):**  And they think of it in a certain way.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:32:11):**  That doesn't need to exist like that in the future with these new technologies.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:32:15):**  And the last example on the top left is intersecting this food capability and precision synthetic  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:32:21):**  biology capability with medicine.

**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:32:30):**  So starting to connect this control at the cellular level and your need for food with  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:32:35):**  medicine and health at a very precise individual level.

**[0:32:43-0:32:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:32:43):**  to participate in.

**[0:32:45-0:32:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:32:45):**  What are the feedstock for these industries?  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:32:48):**  Who's supplying these cell ag industries?

**[0:32:57-0:32:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:32:57):**  These are complex products clearly.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:32:58):**  So who's talking about them in ways that are authentic, that aren't susceptible to viral  
**[0:33:02-0:33:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:33:02):**  dis and misinformation?  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:33:04):**  And it has implications for the whole organization of our food and ag system.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:33:08):**  Everything from research to extension that's often built along commodity lines.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:33:12):**  But these commodity lines are blending and blurring at the consumer end.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:33:16):**  And so what does that mean for our whole research system?  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:33:19):**  Now of course we cannot predict the future and that's not what I was attempting to do  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:33:24):**  today.

**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:33:30):**  more complex.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:33:31):**  And I challenge all of you or invite all of you to think today about ways to participate  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:33:36):**  in new value chains, to think about new infrastructure and how it's changing the world around us.

**[0:33:56-0:33:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/9/the-five-forces-shaping-the-future-of-food-and-ag#t=0:33:56):**  Does any of this resonate with you?

### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 18:59:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:00:09):**  Emerging technologies are rapidly changing the global agricultural industry.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:00:14):**  We believe that this revolution is only getting started, but there's still too much hype out  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:00:19):**  there and too big of a disconnect between ag and ag tech.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:00:23):**  So on this show, we try to bridge that gap.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:00:25):**  In each episode, we bring you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try  
**[0:00:29-0:00:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:00:29):**  to find the place where ag and tech meet.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:00:32):**  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:00:44):**  This week's episode is a live panel from the Ag Tech Meetup in Sydney.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:00:48):**  The topic of the panel is collaboration between researchers and startups in ag tech.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:00:53):**  You'll hear from three guests, Dr. Peter Thorburn, chief research scientist and research group  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:00:58):**  leader in CSIRO's agriculture and food group, Tegan Nock, co-founder and director of Soil  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:01:04):**  SeaQuest, and Nick Hazel, founder and CEO of V2 Foods.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:01:08):**  Given it was a live event, the audio quality is not perfect.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:01:11):**  Sorry about that, but we didn't want you to miss out.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:01:14):**  Before we jump in, a brief backstory on this panel.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:01:17):**  So a few months ago, Peter and I got to talking about researchers working with startups and  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:01:22):**  some of the big cultural differences and challenges.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:01:25):**  He said he had learned some lessons the hard way, but he was willing to share them.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:01:29):**  I told him that he didn't have to go it alone, and so we pulled together this panel with  
**[0:01:32-0:01:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:01:32):**  Tegan and Nick.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:01:34):**  We start off the panel with a bit of fun.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:01:36):**  I asked everyone to share a secret talent, then their normal intro.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:01:40):**  You'll hear from Peter first, then Tegan, and then Nick.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:01:44):**  My secret talent is, I'm told, a very good sensory memory.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:01:48):**  And where that comes in handy is, I'm really into wine, and I love it, and I can do things  
**[0:01:56-0:02:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:01:56):**  like go, oh, that reminds me of when we had a bottle of Clarinvale Shiraz, probably from  
**[0:02:05-0:02:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:02:05):**  Maxwell in 1992, and we're under the gum tree, and our kids were running around or something  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:02:12):**  like that.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:02:13):**  I guess a practical secret talent, too, I'd have to say cake decorating would be mine,  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:02:21):**  which comes in handy when you're about to talk to a researcher about a timeline as a  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:02:26):**  startup.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:02:27):**  I think that's probably the practical application of that one.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:02:32):**  My secret talent's probably singing, and it's the reason why I have to rush out at 7 o'clock  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:02:36):**  tonight because we're singing FÃ¼r es Requiem in the Opera House, so I sing in the Sydney  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:02:40):**  Philharmonic Choir.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:02:42):**  But this year, funnily enough, I don't seem to be singing very much.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:02:45):**  The reason Nick hasn't been singing as much is that he's just formed a startup called  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:02:49):**  V2 Foods.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:02:50):**  They only incorporated in January, but they've made some insane progress since then.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:02:55):**  Basically, a collaboration with CSIRO, Investors Main Sequence, which is a venture capital  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:01):**  fund associated with CSIRO, and Competitive Foods, and a guy called Jack Cowen, who owns  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:07):**  Competitive Foods and Hungry Jacks.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:09):**  And our mission is to figure out what we can do in this plant-based meat space and do something  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:14):**  really as big as we can to make a difference to sustainability on the planet.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:18):**  So that's kind of our big global mission.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:20):**  And we've been working at an insane speed with CSIRO and pulling out research and technology  
**[0:03:28-0:03:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:28):**  as quickly as we possibly can.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:30):**  And we launched in Hungry Jacks with their rebel whopper about 10 days ago, 12 days ago,  
**[0:03:35-0:03:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:35):**  something like that.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:36):**  And we're just accelerating from there.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:38):**  So it's been a bit of a wild ride.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:41):**  My background is R&D multinationals.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:42):**  I was R&D director for Master Foods, R&D director for PepsiCo.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:46):**  And I've been teaching innovation, which is actually where I met you, I think.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:49):**  I was teaching innovation at UTS BCII.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:52):**  I guess my personal background to start with.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:54):**  So I originally come from a property between Parks and Condobolin.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:03:58):**  I am what one of my friends likes to call a drought baby.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:04:02):**  So kids who grew up in that millennium drought and only knew red dirt for a very long time  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:04:09):**  were very surprised when we actually saw what a crop really looked like.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:04:13):**  So I guess from that context, I went to university and studied ag science.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:04:18):**  Had farmed for about seven years back at home and then came back into industry.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:04:23):**  A little bit about the soil sequester story, which links into my story.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:04:27):**  Throughout the time when I was farming, our agronomist had been working with endophytes.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:04:32):**  That's something that he had a real passion for and a speciality in.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:04:36):**  Endophytes are microbes that live symbiotically within a plant.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:04:39):**  So we'd played around with endophytes on the farm for a long time.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:04:42):**  There was some research happening at Sydney Uni that our agronomist was really keen on,  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:04:46):**  had been watching, and it didn't get funded for a second round.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:04:51):**  So as growers who'd been watching that research, a group of us went, you know what, this research  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:04:55):**  is something really, really important and really means something to us.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:04:59):**  It was led by a couple of guys from out west, so Mick Wettenall at Trangie and Guy Webb,  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:05:05):**  our agronomist from Forbes.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:05:06):**  And they picked it up and ran with it and started a not-for-profit and said, this is  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:05:09):**  something we care about, we're going to try and fund it ourselves.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:05:12):**  Through that process, got pulled into this kind of whirlwind of research and looking  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:05:17):**  at different ways of trying to be able to fund research.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:05:20):**  I guess to cut a long story short, it's been quite a few years of pushing and realised  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:05:25):**  that to really have that financial sustainability and to be able to push that research in a  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:05:30):**  way that will really deliver products for growers and something that's actually practical.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:05:34):**  We've stood up a commercialisation next to our not-for-profit to take on investment that  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:05:38):**  can then allow us to have an R&D pipeline going through.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:05:42):**  So we have just gone through our seed series in terms of investment and we're kind of right  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:05:48):**  at the start of our journey, sitting on top of a cliff, you know, watch this space for  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:05:54):**  us.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:05:55):**  Tegan and the Soil Sequest team will be able to share more soon about their capital raise.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:05:58):**  But for now, Tegan was able to say that they've raised about $8.5 million.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:03):**  So stay tuned for more from them.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:05):**  Peter rounds out our intros.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:07):**  I start with being a kid who grew up in the city who was interested in country.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:11):**  So I went off and studied agriculture.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:14):**  In doing that, I found out I really love the way soils and plants interact and how that  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:19):**  happens.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:20):**  And particularly, how do you represent that mathematically?  
**[0:06:22-0:06:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:22):**  I wound up being a cropping systems modeller, which means I collect data to develop algorithms,  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:29):**  I collect data to test algorithms, I take those algorithms and use them to do stuff.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:35):**  Always been interested in science and research, but I really like the impact side of research.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:41):**  But unlike a lot of people, a lot of people say, oh, it's either impact or science.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:46):**  You're either publishing in nature or you're delivering products to farmers.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:49):**  I actually don't believe in that dichotomy.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:51):**  I think they go together.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:54):**  If you're well grounded in what you do in the field, you're looking at impact, you do  
**[0:06:57-0:06:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:57):**  better research.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:06:58):**  On the other hand, if I'm trying to influence government policy, which is one of the things  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:02):**  I'm really interested in doing, if I can whack down a bunch of international journal papers  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:06):**  on the table, they'll never read them, but I've got instant credit in the room with that.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:12):**  And I suspect it's the same when you're dealing with people who don't know the technology  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:17):**  side as much as you.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:19):**  If you're good at your research, you get the credit.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:22):**  It shines through, which then helps you get impact.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:24):**  And so to me, it's this sort of big roundabout that goes on.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:27):**  So I work my way up through the ranks in CSIRO.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:29):**  I lead a group of about 45 multidisciplinary researchers and have some cross-organizational  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:35):**  responsibilities in that area as well.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:38):**  I love Peter's view on research, that impact for industry and good science actually go  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:42):**  hand in hand.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:43):**  I asked Peter to give us an overview of his collaboration with the ag tech startup, GoTerra,  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:48):**  and share what he's learned.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:50):**  It was at an event like this in May last year, Olympia Yaga was the sole person, not part  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:55):**  of a panel.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:07:57):**  And she's starting up, at that stage, was in the process of just raising capital to  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:08:03):**  expand her insect farming company.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:08:06):**  And she got up there and said, hello, I'm Olympia.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:08:10):**  I'm a maggot farmer.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:08:12):**  And I was like, okay, this is worth listening to.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:08:16):**  And then I think she said the phrase, I call bullshit on that, about four times during  
**[0:08:21-0:08:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:08:21):**  her talk about the whole posturing around startup, raising capital and having to prove  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:08:29):**  yourself.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:08:30):**  And so in the course of the evening, she talked about some problems she had farming her maggots.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:08:37):**  And as I said, I lead a multidisciplinary group.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:08:39):**  I have a team of entomologists who actually know a fair bit about raising insects.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:08:44):**  And afterwards, I went up to her and said, hi, I'm Peter.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:08:47):**  I'm from CSIRO.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:08:48):**  I think you need some maggot husbandry.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:08:51):**  And she said, yeah, I sure do.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:08:54):**  And so we agreed to, the conversation lasted for about two minutes.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:08:58):**  So we said, okay, we'll get in touch.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:01):**  And we did.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:02):**  CSIRO has a number of programs to catalyse working with small SMEs where their startups  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:10):**  are not.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:11):**  One of them is Kickstart, which is a co-funding.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:13):**  So we quickly said, oh, let's negotiate the Kickstart.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:17):**  And it was through that that we started getting to know each other and some of the pros and  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:21):**  cons of the different organizations.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:23):**  But despite the alignment between Olympia and Peter's group, things didn't go exactly  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:27):**  as Peter had planned.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:29):**  After our first talk with her about the problems they're having in the business and the production  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:34):**  of black soldier flies, we said, okay, we think we understand your problems.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:40):**  How about we go, and we agreed at this stage, let's have a crack at this.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:43):**  It's Kickstart with sort of 50-50 funding.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:46):**  So the SME puts in a dollar.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:49):**  CSIRO matches it.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:50):**  And we went away and wrote a draft application, sort of thought about the scale of the work  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:09:58):**  that would be needed and stuff like that.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:00):**  And we sent it back to Olympia.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:02):**  And after a while, we weren't getting a lot of response.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:05):**  And one thing we learned is she's incredibly busy.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:08):**  And so we learned to understand that no news wasn't necessarily bad news.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:13):**  And then it came back saying, I actually am interested in something about 40% of that  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:19):**  size and this, that and the other thing.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:22):**  And we were crushed.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:24):**  We didn't know what was going on.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:25):**  Anyone here who works for a research organization used to write grant proposals and get feedback  
**[0:10:29-0:10:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:29):**  and things like that.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:30):**  But we'd never been in this particular situation before.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:33):**  So we more or less manufactured a reason to jump on a plane and go to Canberra and see  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:39):**  the facilities and what she was doing.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:42):**  And in that process, it became really obvious to me that a lot of the things she'd talked  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:48):**  to us about, which at that stage is probably eight weeks before that we'd put in this grant  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:51):**  proposal, they'd already solved.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:10:54):**  And so we sat down and I said, okay, like, you know, you're over here, we're here, how  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:00):**  are we going to bring this together?  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:02):**  And in her honesty, she said, listen, we'd really like to work for you.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:06):**  But while I said at the meetup, how much money we'd raised, it's actually a lot of, in my  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:13):**  words, mouths to feed, there's not a lot left over.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:16):**  And the investors are really putting us under scrutiny with everything we want to spend.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:21):**  So I thought, oh, okay, right.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:22):**  So yeah, let's work to see if there's some common ground.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:27):**  And so I said to her, I'm really impressed by all the problems that we thought you had  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:30):**  that you subsequently solved.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:33):**  So you're going at go-terra speed really fast.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:37):**  And I noticed that the director of CSIRO Agriculture and Food, where I come from today, the business  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:43):**  unit newsletter came out and it was featuring V2 Food.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:46):**  And he talked about the going at start-up speed in the CSIRO side of that.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:51):**  So I'm glad he's flogged my idea.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:53):**  And I said, but you know, one of the things about research organisations, our research  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:56):**  is really robust.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:11:57):**  You know, if we say A is different to B, A is different to B everywhere, or we know where  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:12:02):**  it is and where it isn't and things like that.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:12:05):**  So can we find a problem that you've got that you need to solve fast, that we've got the  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:12:11):**  skills and we can travel at go-terra speed with, or something that is so critical to  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:12:16):**  your business, you need a robust solution.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:12:20):**  You know you need to invest in something that's going to take a lot longer.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:12:25):**  We came to the former, wrote a sort of a two-phase agreement, a first phase to solve some of  
**[0:12:32-0:12:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:12:32):**  the here and now problems.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:12:33):**  They also allowed, I suppose, go-terra to work out whether we actually deliver or not.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:12:39):**  And we've negotiated the second phase, which will be happening between now and Christmas.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:12:43):**  So a couple insights there that I wrote down.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:12:45):**  One, like start-ups are busy, which is something probably everyone knows and everyone's busy,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:12:49):**  I suppose, but start-ups especially.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:12:51):**  The other one is this kind of 80-20 rule, which comes up a lot, that start-ups often  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:12:55):**  only need things solved to 80% and researchers are often incentivised to solve things to  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:12:59):**  100%.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:13:00):**  So I'm curious, maybe Nick, to hear a little bit more of the V2 origin story, but did you  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:13:05):**  have any parallels in terms of pace of the organisations working or researchers wanting  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:13:11):**  to be more kind of 100% correct and you only needed things 80% correct?  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:13:15):**  Any parallels there?  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:13:16):**  And Tegan, you do.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:13:18):**  So the origin story, we came out of a conversation with Jack and Phil and Martin Cole from CSIRO  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:13:23):**  about this space and was there some technology or some knowledge in CSIRO which can be brought  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:13:28):**  to bear on that.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:13:29):**  And then the decision was taken was on the basis that there was some protein chemistry  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:13:33):**  and some knowledge in protein chemistry, protein extraction and some knowledge around meat  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:13:37):**  flavour chemistry, which was sitting in the organisation that, yes, they could bring some  
**[0:13:43-0:13:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:13:43):**  expertise to bear.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:13:45):**  And the decision was to do a start-up because it was very clear that the only way we were  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:13:48):**  going to get that stuff out of CSIRO into anything useful was to actually form a company  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:13:52):**  around that and that was when they asked me to do it.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:13:55):**  Interestingly, the process of CSIRO writing what they call Statements of Work, it's just  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:14:02):**  so tortuous and crazy because the process is there for attracting funds from external  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:14:09):**  funds or from, you know, for long-term research.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:14:12):**  A lot of work goes into writing a Statement of Work when actually in start-up world you  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:14:16):**  know broadly what the outcome is and what's useful for you, but you're really not interested  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:14:21):**  in milestones that may be six months away or three months away or even two weeks away.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:14:26):**  It's just of no interest whatsoever.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:14:28):**  It's get started, do something useful and we'll evaluate it as we go.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:14:32):**  And that's something which has been a journey.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:14:34):**  I think we've now on like project number 13 or 14 with CSIRO, we're spending a lot of money  
**[0:14:41-0:14:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:14:41):**  with CSIRO and they're getting used to being a little bit looser with the Statements of  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:14:44):**  Work and I'm sort of guaranteeing that I'm not going to hold them to a Statement of Work,  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:14:48):**  which I think personally is ridiculous, but I will hold them to the effort in achieving  
**[0:14:52-0:14:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:14:52):**  an outcome which I think is important for the consumer.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:14:54):**  And it's just a totally different mindset and it's a different world for the researchers  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:14:58):**  to work for a start-up that's only interested in stuff that's useful for the consumer and  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:02):**  not interested in delivering the Statement of Work in itself.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:06):**  And I've noticed that also in other organisations like I did some consulting for MLA long-term  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:11):**  research and they would sweat this Statement of Work with all of the milestones and then  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:15):**  you'd have project management teams that would hold people's feet to the fire because they  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:19):**  didn't achieve a milestone.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:21):**  But no one ever bothered to ask the question, well was that milestone useful?  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:25):**  It was written two years before and it might have been useful in the eye of somebody two  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:29):**  years before, but actually the world has moved on and it's no longer useful and yet the organisation  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:33):**  is still doing its best to deliver a useless milestone.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:37):**  Crazy.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:38):**  So what's noticeable now is that everyone's a little bit looser now and of course it helps  
**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:42):**  that it's our money, it's venture capital money.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:44):**  We're a little bit looser with it.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:46):**  Speed for us is everything because we're on this wave and we know that if we come up with  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:49):**  a fantastic solution in two years time, well it's too late.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:53):**  We have to have fantastic solutions now.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:55):**  But I think also I'm noticing that CSIRO is getting it as well a little bit and they're  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:15:58):**  becoming a little bit looser in the Statement of Work phase of the research.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:16:02):**  I just agree with that one and I'd say that we've had a collaboration ongoing with ANU  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:16:09):**  for a little while now and from that we've realised that one of the big keys is finding  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:16:14):**  the right researcher or the right researcher group to work with sometimes.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:16:18):**  We've paired up with the Borovitz group at ANU and with the way that we're working our  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:16:23):**  mission is obviously carbon sequestration, looking at climate adaptation and mitigation  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:16:27):**  for agriculture and their group is hugely aligned in that aspect.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:16:32):**  They're working with a lot of other technologies that really sit in this space and have been  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:16:36):**  working with not necessarily start-ups but fast organisations previously and we've found  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:16:42):**  that a really, really fantastic experience just because they're so driven for the mission  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:16:47):**  as well.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:16:48):**  Obviously the science has to be robust, it's something that they take a lot of time looking  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:16:53):**  over the way that we're working with methodologies and the likes but it's having that mission  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:16:57):**  that's aligned up front, you're on the same page and you can start to get straight to  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:17:02):**  the work as opposed to sometimes going through the bureaucracy of dealing with research institutions.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:17:08):**  It's taking the time to find the right person to work with and it makes things an awful  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:17:13):**  lot easier.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:17:14):**  One of the things that gets talked about a lot in the researcher start-up collaborations  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:17:18):**  is IP and that the start-up needs freedom to operate and to raise money, they need to  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:17:23):**  show that they own the IP but the researcher wants to show return to tax payers or that  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:17:29):**  otherwise it's getting distributed to everyone.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:17:32):**  How have you guys in these projects navigated that challenge?  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:17:35):**  It's always an issue and CSIRO historically have been really difficult to deal with when  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:17:39):**  it comes to IP.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:17:40):**  With us it's easy, I pay them a lot of money to do research and I own the IP that comes  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:17:44):**  out of it.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:17:45):**  They have freedom to exploit any IP that comes out of it that's come from their knowledge  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:17:49):**  in areas that are not related to what I'm doing and lots of freedom to publish and get  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:17:54):**  the kudos and the reputation stuff so it's actually relaxed things a bit because it used  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:17:59):**  to be a bun fight, you know the first six months of any research contract with CSIRO  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:18:02):**  was a discussion about IP and life's too short, you know you've just got to get over it and  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:18:08):**  with universities it was even worse in a way because some universities would forget that  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:18:12):**  their mission was to educate and to push the boundaries of science and you would get into  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:18:18):**  crazy discussions around IP.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:18:20):**  I think it's relaxing actually, I think people are realising what's it about, what are we  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:18:24):**  actually trying to do here and the reality of course is that patent has no value, it  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:18:28):**  has no value, most patents have no value whatsoever.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:18:32):**  We're still obsessed with IP in a world where actually we've just got to be obsessed with  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:18:36):**  speed because actually the prize goes to the ones who were first so yeah I think it's a  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:18:41):**  journey but I can see already that it's sort of thawing out.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:18:45):**  When you're collaborating with another organisation there's things that are of key importance  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:18:50):**  to you and there's things that are of key importance to them and it's as you develop  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:18:54):**  that collaboration, work out what's most important to you, what's most important to them and  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:18:57):**  how can you cater to both so we have a project that's happening over the course of next year  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:19:04):**  and it's a climate resilient soils network so we're looking at microbes in the agricultural  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:19:09):**  system from a systems point of view as well as pinpointing actual strains of organisms  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:19:15):**  that have a particular effect.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:19:17):**  So when we're working with researchers on that project we're saying well obviously there's  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:19:22):**  that systems piece that is hugely publishable, like there's so much that we want to share  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:19:26):**  with everybody that's for common good, common knowledge looking at that systems piece and  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:19:31):**  how do we actually build carbon within the system but then there's also the piece that  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:19:35):**  we can gain you know as Soils Sequestion from a commercial point of view in terms of some  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:19:40):**  of those specific isolates and what we actually want to get out of them in terms of IP so  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:19:45):**  it's step back for a moment and say well what do they want to gain and what do we need to  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:19:49):**  gain and how can we make a project work for both.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:19:52):**  I thought about that long and hard in going into the discussions of Go-Tira and I think  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:19:57):**  it was very clear in my mind that they own the IP and well as an organisation we have  
**[0:20:03-0:20:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:20:03):**  a range of positions on IP depending on how much of the work is funded by CSIRO.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:20:09):**  If we're contributing funds to it we generally think we should have a share of the IP.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:20:14):**  On the other hand if people are paying a lot of money as you know to quote what you said  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:20:19):**  then we can be more relaxed so it's a big organisation people are individuals as you  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:20:24):**  say you've got to get the right people but yeah IP is something that can always be negotiated.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:20:28):**  I want to ask all of you if in this journey there's anything in looking back that you  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:20:32):**  would do differently in terms of collaboration or more broadly but things that you've said  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:20:38):**  oh we kind of botched that one up and wish we had done that differently.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:20:42):**  I suppose the opposite story to our experience with Go-Tira specifically has been sitting  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:20:47):**  down with somebody a start up talking with them getting all excited actually going through  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:20:53):**  writing a lean business canvas and meeting them and things like that and at the end of  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:20:59):**  the day they wanted to sell us stuff.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:21:02):**  They had a data collection system you know when you scraped away they thought the data  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:21:07):**  that they were collecting from the farmers they were working with would be super valuable  
**[0:21:11-0:21:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:21:11):**  to an organisation like ours or others and it was all just a fig leaf for can I flog  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:21:19):**  in my product and I'm sure anyone on the VC side or the start up side can tell an opposite  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:21:25):**  story where the researcher is coming with a hammer saying can I turn your problem into  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:21:30):**  a nail sort of thing so it's that complete mismatch and the time it takes to uncover  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:21:35):**  that would be my lesson.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:21:38):**  Looking at the Soil Sequests journey and it's probably not a mistake but it could be something  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:21:45):**  to reflect on.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:21:46):**  It was a period of probably six years that Soil Sequests was operating solely as a not  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:21:50):**  for profit and was driven off the back of a lot of goodwill.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:21:55):**  Certainly a lot of crowd funding happened during that time you know we were driven by  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:21:59):**  farmers for farmers was the mantra that we were using and obviously trying to be very  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:22:04):**  true to that statement but it certainly was something that was an uphill battle and we  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:22:10):**  had moments where there were organisations coming to us and saying we want to buy your  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:22:15):**  science we want to you know have a piece of what you've got and we were very idealistic  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:22:20):**  about it saying no this is an organisation that's by farmers for farmers we're going  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:22:24):**  to stay true to that and it took us a long time to work out the model that was still  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:22:30):**  true to that still true to the mission but enabled us to really get on with the research  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:22:35):**  in a big way and that was just such a long period of time and it's probably something  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:22:40):**  that if you're thinking about setting up an alternative model do a lot of research and  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:22:44):**  look around and see what else there is out there what really works and what can actually  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:22:49):**  align to that mission to save probably a lot of hours of crowd funding that's not necessarily  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:22:54):**  needed in some cases.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:22:56):**  With V2 it's pretty difficult actually because things have gone so fast and we've been lucky  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:23:01):**  in many ways so it's difficult to say what we did I mean we've made heaps of mistakes  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:23:05):**  but we've recovered from them days after making mistakes so we've never had a fatal mistake  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:23:10):**  so that's pretty lucky.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:23:11):**  I wish I'd met you earlier that would have been good because that would save me there's  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:23:15):**  me thinking about how are we going to grow legumes in a sustainable way that's carbon  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:23:20):**  positive the reason why plant-based meat is important is because we want to reduce our  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:23:24):**  carbon footprint and ultimately we have to suck carbon out of the atmosphere it's already  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:23:28):**  known obviously that we're at a tipping point we're maybe even past the tipping point we've  
**[0:23:32-0:23:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:23:32):**  got to start doing something drastic here and eating plant-based meat is good than meat  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:23:38):**  or reducing your meat consumption but the next question is going to be how sustainable  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:23:42):**  were those plants and was it you know and there's a huge difference obviously depending  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:23:47):**  on how you look after your soils about whether or not you're sequestering carbon or actually  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:23:52):**  depleting your soils so I'm glad we met because that ultimately for the longevity of our brand  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:23:57):**  we have to be part of a sustainable Australian ecosystem so live up to the clean green image  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:24:02):**  that we have abroad and we actually make it true because there's a gap potentially between  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:24:07):**  our image and what's actually happening from a climate change perspective in Australia  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:24:11):**  so thanks because that's great I mean we've got we're going to collaborate now.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:24:16):**  Hopefully Tegan and Nick do find some ways to collaborate that's really what the meetup  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:24:20):**  is about people meeting each other and finding ways to work together.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:24:23):**  The last question for me for the panel was about farmers.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:24:26):**  For ag tech and food tech obviously farmers are a key part of the whole equation and we  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:24:31):**  often talk about the researcher startup collaborations but probably talk less about how some of these  
**[0:24:37-0:24:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:24:37):**  ag tech and food tech businesses work with and how the researchers work with startups  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:24:41):**  so there's kind of a few angles here one is you know CSIRO on just closed and that was  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:24:46):**  a big program to help researchers think more about their customers you mentioned before  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:24:50):**  that Nick through your work you got customer feedback getting passed back to the researchers  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:24:54):**  and helping them think more customer centric so I don't know if you guys have any comments  
**[0:24:58-0:25:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:24:58):**  on collaboration with farmers and how that is or isn't different or challenging in terms  
**[0:25:05-0:25:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:25:05):**  of where you guys sit.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:25:06):**  We do a lot of work with farmers the particular industry that I work most in I mean one of  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:25:10):**  the things we do have is really deep networks into that farmer community and not only a  
**[0:25:16-0:25:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:25:16):**  reasonably good sense of how they think and what their priorities are and how they operate  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:25:20):**  their business but also those links to say oh you know you want to talk to someone about  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:25:26):**  such and such we can do that and we do that regularly so you know when we're developing  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:25:32):**  decision support systems apps and things like that you know have UXD people coming in working  
**[0:25:38-0:25:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:25:38):**  with farmers and getting the right people.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:25:41):**  This is all people stuff isn't it you meet an SME people you don't know you get to know  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:25:45):**  them you work out can you communicate or not farmers likewise and then it becomes a triangle  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:25:51):**  how you can do with that so a lot of us in agriculture are pretty farmer centric and  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:25:56):**  have pretty good connections into that and sort of have a understanding of the way farmers  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:26:02):**  that said it's really interesting when you get challenged by someone from outside that  
**[0:26:06-0:26:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:26:06):**  says oh do you know whether it's the male or the female in the household who's driving  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:26:13):**  the technology development on the farm or something I've never asked that question so  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:26:17):**  there's always more to learn.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:26:19):**  I couldn't stress that one that sentiment enough either so we talk a lot about farmers  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:26:25):**  and I would say the one thing that we have to be really conscious of in the ag tech space  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:26:31):**  is that we use the word farmer but it is not a homogenous group of people you know you  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:26:37):**  have a huge scope of people who are farming with different values you have a huge scope  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:26:41):**  of people who are farming with different interests in terms of are they interested in soil health  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:26:45):**  is it precision ag that you know they're focused on people who have different appetites for  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:26:49):**  risk it's not just engaging I'd say with what you perceive typically as a farmer it's making  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:26:56):**  sure that you're engaging with the whole spectrum of growers and I guess soil sequests our story  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:27:00):**  is quite farmer centric but can't stress the importance of making sure that the problem  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:27:06):**  that you're addressing is actually a problem for farmers and dig deep and make sure that  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:27:10):**  that is the problem challenge your assumptions and make sure it is a problem that you're  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:27:14):**  actually addressing and constantly have that feedback loop with the growers that you're  
**[0:27:18-0:27:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:27:18):**  working to address that issue for.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:27:20):**  I'm not really qualified to be honest I'm not that close to the farms I mean when I  
**[0:27:24-0:27:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:27:24):**  was at PepsiCo I know that a lot of the business model for Frito-Lay globally is really connected  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:27:31):**  to their ability to connect with farmers and encourage farmers to grow better potatoes  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:27:36):**  which results in better potato chips and there's a very direct feedback loop to make sure that  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:27:41):**  that is a reinforcing system and it's a long term system that covers generations you know  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:27:45):**  generations of farmers learning how to do the right thing variety development soil management  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:27:50):**  all sorts of things results in a sort of an ecosystem which is profitable for everybody  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:27:55):**  a farmer gets security and it was funny because we were just talking about that is that because  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:28:00):**  farming is the most risky occupation it's risks that and I say I'm coming from outside  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:28:06):**  but I know the risks associated are risks that we would never normally take but farmers  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:28:11):**  take these every day or every year when they decide to so and I wonder what is an ecosystem  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:28:16):**  which is more resilient and less risky that isn't subject to the global markets where  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:28:22):**  something happens in Ukraine and suddenly the bottom falls out of the potato market  
**[0:28:27-0:28:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:28:27):**  or something and the farmer thought they were going to make some money and now they make  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:28:30):**  nothing not through any fault of their own what is that system that we could create around  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:28:36):**  a sort of a sustainable ecosystem in Australia which combines the sustainability and the  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:28:41):**  carbon sequestration all the things that we know that is part of the agricultural system  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:28:45):**  with resilience but we don't just throw it away because something happens somewhere else  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:28:49):**  in the world and why is it that we have this sort of farm gate mentality I don't know the  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:28:54):**  solution but I've been observing it from the outside and thinking this is not a recipe  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:28:58):**  for a resilient system and it's not going to be helpful for when we actually try and  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:29:03):**  have a system that sequesters carbon and feeds the world in a much more resilient way so  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:29:10):**  I don't know the answer but I suspect that maybe almost draw a boundary around us but  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:29:16):**  somehow make us more resilient to what happens elsewhere in the world because you can't build  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:29:21):**  a resilient system if your input costs or your output costs just double or halve from  
**[0:29:27-0:29:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:29:27):**  one year to the next you can't build a business that way and I don't think you can build a  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:29:30):**  resilient system that way.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:29:32):**  I could ask these guys questions for literally two more hours but there are questions from  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:29:36):**  you guys I'm sure and beers to be drunk and Friday nights to be had elsewhere so I will  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:29:40):**  wrap up my questions there and Nick has to go sing at the Opera House otherwise he'll  
**[0:29:44-0:29:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:29:44):**  have to sing for us and that will be better for us but worse for him.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:29:47):**  So from a small start-up perspective Lewis Biscarp in collaboration it's really tricky  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:29:52):**  in Australia we've got like however many RDCs we've got all the state departments and you  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:29:57):**  have to keep trying with each one and have different communications protocols and if  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:30:02):**  one person leaves you lose all your progress do you see any way in which we can kind of  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:30:07):**  streamline the process of like this completely segmented research and development process?  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:30:13):**  I think at the moment that's the question on everyone's lips the government has acknowledged  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:30:17):**  that that is definitely an issue going forward there's at the moment a review looking into  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:30:22):**  exactly that how does the RDC system collaborate better there's some key areas where they uniform  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:30:28):**  across the RDC systems there's things like water there's things like climate there's  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:30:32):**  things like soils I definitely don't have the answer but I would say that it's something  
**[0:30:38-0:30:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:30:38):**  that you should definitely speak out about like if you're having those issues and if  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:30:44):**  you're seeing those issues definitely have those conversations with the RDCs themselves  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:30:49):**  because there's some really interesting things that's happening in the RDC space at the moment  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:30:52):**  and they're really open to those conversations.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:30:54):**  I'd flip that round and say from my point of view and I know this is my colleagues think  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:31:00):**  of this as well you're dealing with a start-up and bang they pivot and bang they pivot okay  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:31:05):**  so the conversation can completely change or you're dealing with a large company and  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:31:10):**  the person the influential person you've been dealing with has left or they've moved on  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:31:16):**  and they've done something else I'm not sure that this isn't actually anything other than  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:31:21):**  human nature and organisational culture big small government non-government private sort  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:31:27):**  of thing and I suppose that's why humans are so good at making networks and relationships  
**[0:31:31-0:31:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:31:31):**  to you know surf that space rather than having a sort of an institutional approach to it  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:31:38):**  which is oh well there is this prime ministerially appointed single point of contact for such  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:31:44):**  and such science in the country is that going to work I don't think so it doesn't work in  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:31:48):**  our organisation they're like with multiple ones but yeah so from our side we see that  
**[0:31:53-0:31:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:31:53):**  turbulence as well.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:31:55):**  Richard Heath Australian Farm Institute the structural changes to have better collaboration  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:32:00):**  are happening I can say that as an RDC director but you can do all the structural change in  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:32:05):**  the world and it has no effect if you don't have the cultural piece right and I think  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:32:10):**  that I'm just particularly interested in Nick's comments on this given your global experience  
**[0:32:14-0:32:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:32:14):**  about collaboration culture around the world and how we sit in Australia if we just culturally  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:32:22):**  understanding of what collaboration is about and what we need to do to get better at doing  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:32:26):**  that so we actually have the structural changes have effect.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:32:30):**  Nick  
**[0:32:25-0:32:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:32:25):**  Nick  
**[0:32:28-0:32:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:32:28):**  I did a lot of research in Holland I was 11 years in Holland doing as R&D director for  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:32:35):**  Mars in Europe and Holland has a really really good innovation ecosystem in agriculture if  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:32:40):**  you want to aspire to something it's Holland that does it and I was trying to unpick why  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:32:44):**  they say good now obviously Holland is a trading country and it has a really huge you know  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:32:48):**  trading network you know into Europe etc and maybe it's something about the Dutch character  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:32:53):**  and they do trade they'll talk to anybody they'll always negotiate you know it's all  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:32:57):**  about networks they're all multilingual they will do what they need to do to make the networks  
**[0:33:02-0:33:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:33:02):**  to make the trade.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:33:03):**  There's a few other things that are interesting and one of the things I always fought for  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:33:06):**  and I'm obviously useless as a government lobbyist was things like the R&D tax when  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:33:11):**  I was in multinationals it was a big frustration there was me I was R&D director of a big multinational  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:33:17):**  everyone assumed I had heaps of money to spend and that the R&D tax would come to me to you  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:33:22):**  know invest in you know universities and CSIRO and the reality of course is R&D tax goes  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:33:26):**  to treasury which goes back to head office and the R&D director is going well hang on  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:33:30):**  a minute I've just sort of two million dollars where is it and well it's gone.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:33:35):**  So it was understanding that that's also a system how do we get the money that government  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:33:39):**  does put into innovation gets it in the hand of players who can actually make the ecosystem  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:33:45):**  better I know we focus on small business and small business is really good I'm a small  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:33:50):**  businessman now but when I was in a big business big businesses can really get momentum behind  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:33:55):**  big projects because they do have that scale in Australia there are no there is no more  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:34:00):**  R&D left in food organisations in Australia everything has gone abroad now the reason  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:34:04):**  is actually because none of the big businesses have got any real money or cash to work with  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:34:10):**  universities or with the CSIRO simply because a very simple mechanism the R&D tax doesn't  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:34:15):**  give the money back to the companies it gives it back to treasury so it's a frustration  
**[0:34:20-0:34:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:34:20):**  I've lobbied for a long time it's just never worked.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:34:23):**  I had this chat today with a gentleman I just met so he is a grew up on a farm in South  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:34:28):**  Australia they own properties in the Northern Territory so pretty kind of ag background  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:34:33):**  ended up going over to UC Berkeley for an MBA recently and got involved in the start  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:34:38):**  up scene in Silicon Valley founded a biotech start up that was acquired and then has gotten  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:34:43):**  really excited about bringing some of the technologies and lessons back to agriculture  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:34:46):**  in Australia so he was talking to me about kind of what's happening here and how to get  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:34:49):**  involved and he's like oh I have a few ideas for a start up you know working on a couple  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:34:53):**  of things and I immediately thought he's not going to tell me the ideas because I'm so  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:34:58):**  used to in Australia people keeping ideas really close to their chest and he goes yeah  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:35:03):**  so my first one is this and my second one is this and my third one is this and he just  
**[0:35:06-0:35:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:35:06):**  told them all to me and I was like let me just call you out on this because that's amazing  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:35:12):**  that you told me these ideas here's 17 people I can connect you to that are interested in  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:35:15):**  these spaces and I'm more than happy to make all of these introductions and he was like  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:35:19):**  that's amazing I'll send you an email right now and then we were both reflecting on the  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:35:22):**  fact that that's not how things usually work in Australia and that it wasn't until he went  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:35:27):**  to UC Berkeley and had so many people just open doors and make connections and share  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:35:32):**  lessons that he learned that that's how business can get done so much more effectively and  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:35:38):**  so it's not to bash Australia because obviously there are many Australians who are super collaborative  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:35:43):**  and open with what they do but it is a kind of cultural difference that I've really noticed  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:35:48):**  gets challenged in the US for sure.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:35:50):**  Andrew Kirk, product marketer in technology for some time interested in Ag. Just on collaboration  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:35:56):**  I'm interested in when you're reflecting on your collaborations we've heard about troubles  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:36:02):**  of things going awry in a collaboration some being successful when you reflect on them  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:36:07):**  what signs give you an indication that it's going well what signs give you an indication  
**[0:36:11-0:36:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:36:11):**  that it's not going so well?  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:36:13):**  It's like any other human relationship are you being open do you think the other person's  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:36:17):**  being open can you identify areas of common interest are you prepared to be honest and  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:36:23):**  say actually no this isn't an area of interest for me thanks but no thanks and walk away  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:36:28):**  rather than try and pretend something different for that and it's no different for us collaborating  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:36:34):**  in some respects as I talked before about getting to learn about the trials and tribulations  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:36:39):**  of being in a start-up but we do most of our research in collaboration with other organisations  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:36:45):**  it could be pharma group it could be another R&D organisation what are the value systems  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:36:50):**  what are the drivers of behaviour what are the reward systems in that and can you get  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:36:54):**  around that stuff and finally and at the end of the day a lot of it is do you like that  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:36:59):**  person do you have someone on the other side who you feel warm about and who feels warm  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:37:04):**  about you and you're just going to stick through to confirm I was talking to a colleague recently  
**[0:37:08-0:37:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:37:08):**  who is saying this person in this AgTech SME they've just been so good at sticking with  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:37:17):**  this and they ring up occasionally and say oh what's happening is it all good it's been  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:37:21):**  quite and so my colleague says yeah no it's fine it's just taken a while to grind through  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:37:25):**  the wheels and then they talk about football for half an hour so yeah I don't know it's  
**[0:37:31-0:37:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:37:31):**  particularly magical to any other human interactions.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:37:34):**  I love your story and it's true we've just got to have lots of conversations I mean we  
**[0:37:39-0:37:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:37:39):**  just hold on to stuff we should just talk about what we're dreaming what we're hoping  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:37:42):**  and that means that serendipity will happen and I've been reasonably visible it means  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:37:46):**  that there's lots of serendipity because lots of people say hey you said something about  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:37:50):**  this so I know something about that and some of it doesn't come to anything and also force  
**[0:37:53-0:37:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:37:53):**  fitting collaboration where it really isn't there where you really aren't aligned there  
**[0:37:57-0:38:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:37:57):**  isn't value for both that's fine too you had a great conversation didn't go anywhere great  
**[0:38:01-0:38:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:38:01):**  you have another conversation and just how we get those behaviors and also how we have  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:38:04):**  those forums so the work that you do bringing lots of people together there are certain  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:38:09):**  individuals who are master networkers who just love bringing people together those people  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:38:15):**  are gold and obviously Sarah's one of them and there's others who are just they bring  
**[0:38:19-0:38:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:38:19):**  people together their life's mission is to bring people together to have interesting  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:38:22):**  conversations and out of some of those conversations there'll be a little spark and that could  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:38:27):**  be really valuable and that's you know and that's the the luck that you need to get things  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:38:31):**  going and there's been a couple already tonight so that's great.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:38:35):**  That's a perfect way to end so I wanted you guys to just like 30 seconds if there's something  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:38:40):**  you're looking for a collaboration or connection that you want that the audience can maybe  
**[0:38:45-0:38:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:38:45):**  help with or someone they know anything that's on your wish list or as Nick said your hopes  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:38:48):**  and dreams list the audience here tonight are listening to podcast can maybe help with.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:38:53):**  I think as a parting gesture rather than saying oh you know I want to speak to you by a sense  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:38:58):**  of guys because I actually do as an organization there's lots of different ways to interact  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:39:03):**  with us as almost as many ways as there are people in the organization so don't be afraid  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:39:08):**  to pick up the phone and you know just say Nick you know you've got the people are natural  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:39:13):**  connectors and if you find someone it might lead you to someone to someone to someone  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:39:17):**  so yeah we're always interested in how to get our work on the ground and make agriculture  
**[0:39:23-0:39:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:39:23):**  and other facets of society better.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:39:25):**  We are in the process of growing we're seeking researchers we're seeking people with specialist  
**[0:39:34-0:39:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:39:34):**  skills in the areas of soil carbon microbiology anything and everything that relates to our  
**[0:39:40-0:39:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:39:40):**  project at the moment so if you think you know of anyone or if you think you are that  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:39:43):**  someone reach out and have a chat even if it's not to come on board it's to it's to  
**[0:39:47-0:39:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:39:47):**  share some learnings.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:39:48):**  I'm at Tegan so that's that's my win out of the scene.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:39:52):**  You don't need anyone else.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:39:53):**  Don't need anyone else no.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:39:54):**  It's difficult I mean what we're trying to do is you know we want to build a brand in  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:39:59):**  Australia we want to build sustainability is the same time as building all the technology  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:40:04):**  it's everything is being done in parallel so you know and I'm using and I'm collaborating  
**[0:40:08-0:40:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:40:08):**  with CSIRO.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:40:09):**  Luckily with CSIRO there are connectors within CSIRO and a few of them actually know what  
**[0:40:14-0:40:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:40:14):**  some of the people in CSIRO do.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:40:16):**  There's even within CSIRO there's very few people who know what the what there is there  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:40:20):**  that you can grab hold of so that that's always a challenge.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:40:24):**  So no there's nothing I don't say there's nothing I need there's everything I need everything  
**[0:40:28-0:40:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:40:28):**  and nothing so and I am I mean and also I'm recruiting and it's interesting to start up  
**[0:40:33-0:40:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:40:33):**  and this is maybe something I should I should share because I never knew this is because  
**[0:40:37-0:40:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:40:37):**  I've got no time to do recruiting.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:40:39):**  It's amazing the team I've got is kind of landed on my lap from people who've actually  
**[0:40:43-0:40:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:40:43):**  approached me and were brave enough to say hey Nick I'm passionate about this I've got  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:40:46):**  these and these skills and then suddenly they're in my team because I've got time to go and  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:40:51):**  do proper recruitment process so so if you have skills don't be shy go and approach if  
**[0:40:56-0:40:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:40:56):**  there's somebody who's doing something that's really interesting just go and approach them  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=458170#t=0:40:59):**  and who knows you might end up as employee number number 12 or something.

### Agtech - So What?  (2021-04-21)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Ag Tech So What, brought to you by the Agthente Group.  I'm your host, Sarah Nollet.  I'm really excited about today's guest, Vani Estes.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:11):**  Not only is she an industry leader in food and ag, but she's also refreshingly candid  about her own experiences working for large and small ag and food companies.  This is Vani, remembering the US biofuels craze of the mid 2000s.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:25):**  They said build these gigantic plants and my job at the time I was working for DuPont  and I was in charge of a program that we were looking at converting corn stover into fuel  and I had, it was a beaker in a lab.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:41):**  Like that's where my technology was.  It was a beaker, you know, fermenting in a lab and people were saying, here's a check  for a hundred million dollars, go build a hundred million gallon ethanol plant.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:54):**  So it was a lot of push without really looking at the system.  These days, Vani is the vice president of technology at the Produce Marketing Association  or PMA.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:03):**  Her role is to help fruit and vegetable growers in industry to adopt and integrate new technologies.  Previously Vani's worked for Monsanto, Syngenta and with numerous ag and biotech startups.  In this episode, you'll hear some of the hard lessons she's learned along the way, what  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:17):**  the future of gene editing might look like and the parallels between the hype around  biofuels two decades ago and the hype around soil carbon today.  But first, this is how Vani came to join the ag and food world.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:31):**  So I got my undergraduate degree from New Mexico State University in horticulture and  worked for a little bit in greenhouses and realized that I was never going to pay any  bills working in greenhouses.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:44):**  But I did have kind of that early experience of working in indoor ag as a greenhouse.  And then I went to UC Davis and got my master's degree in plant pathology.  And so that was kind of the beginning of that.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:58):**  And my first job out of graduate school was working with a company called DNA Plant Technologies,  which was one of the very early genetically engineering plant companies that it doesn't  exist anymore.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:10):**  But that was a really exciting time.  I got to be on very early stages of what was happening with genetic engineering and crops  and where that could go.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:20):**  And so for the next 15 years, I worked in kind of ag biotech in that whole area, really  on the cutting edge of what is this technology?  What can we do with it?  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:28):**  How can we grow more sustainably?  How can we make better crops?  So that was a really exciting time working.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:36):**  I worked for Dnap, like I said, and a company called Paradigm Genetics and worked for Monsanto  for a while and also worked for a company that was buying seed companies all over the  world and helping integrate some traits into those.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:52):**  Vani was at Monsanto in the mid 1990s.  It was a time when Roundup could be found in garages across suburbia, used commonly  as a spray for weeds.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:00):**  But for agriculture, the 90s brought about major leaps in biotech when Monsanto introduced  the first Roundup ready seeds in soybeans, corn and cotton using genetic modification.  At the time, the science was revolutionary, but no one imagined how much pushback there'd  
**[0:03:15-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:15):**  be against GMOs.  Vani was right in the middle of this and learned a lot about social license.  Now when you say you work for Monsanto, like everybody cringes.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:24):**  So that was in the mid 90s.  And I know there's, I'm sure there are conversations in the boardroom that are different than this,  but for me being there, it was, we had these cool tools.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:34):**  We can do these really cool things so that you don't have to spray insecticide and so  that you don't have to till and so that you can do all these other things that are more  sustainable.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:43):**  So the conversations internally were like, this is really cool stuff and this is going  to allow us to grow more sustainably.  So that was the conversation.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:52):**  And what we completely missed out of arrogance certainly was that we kind of needed to bring  people along with us in that little journey of that thought process.  And so when it wasn't communicated to consumers in a good way and consumers certainly didn't  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:11):**  see any benefit for them in BT Cotton, then that's when a lot of the problems happened.  But it's really interesting to think back on, to me, it was quite exciting that the  technology could do this and really seeing the missteps that happen from a communication  
**[0:04:26-0:04:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:26):**  social license point of view.  Yeah, for sure.  Was there ever a moment or a story of consumer pushback or something happening where you  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:34):**  started to realize maybe you got it wrong or that how you guys were thinking about it  internally was really different than how the world was seeing it?  Yeah, actually, I'll tell you a more recent story that even reflects on me worse.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:46):**  So I was up in Washington State, summer before last, before COVID and we were still traveling.  And I was talking, we were doing grower visits and we did a dinner with a bunch of apple  growers.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:00):**  And I was talking about the Arctic apple, which is a GMO apple, right?  And non-browning, great sustainability food waste story.  I think they've done a pretty good job of communicating to consumers.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:12):**  They don't hide it.  They tell people this is GMO.  And so we're at this brewery outside.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:18):**  There's like hops growing in the background.  It was really beautiful.  And so I started talking about technology because that's my job.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:23):**  So I'm talking about technology and there's all these great technology and then it's coming  to apples and I start talking about the Arctic apple and I just see the room just go dead.  Well, it was outside, but I see the group go dead and the eyes like daggers.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:38):**  And I'm like, this is very familiar.  I remember this and I just, of all people I should know not to bring up a topic like  that until you really understand how it affects the people in the room and what their feelings  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:52):**  were.  And my feeling about it was that before Arctic apple, when they were trading outside the  country like when they were selling their apples, they never had to answer the question  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:03):**  is this GMO?  And so that was one of, they said, we're getting hit, we're getting the negatives and not the  positives about this.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:11):**  So that was an interesting flash forward 20 years later that you really need to pay attention  to who you're talking to and how you talk to them about technology and food.  Yeah, my sense is that the industry hasn't fully learned this lesson and because it's  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:25):**  not an easy one to learn that we say now, Oh, we need to listen more and we need to  have more conversations and highlight the benefits.  And then we sort of do that, but the response isn't really all that different.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:35):**  And yet at the same time, there's lots of research about how agriculture is really trusted  and we have all this goodwill and people do believe in farmers.  So I guess my sense is, I don't know what we do differently.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:44):**  Do you have a good sense of how to do this differently or any hope around what's changing?  Well, I think we've got another opportunity with gene editing and I've worked in gene  editing at a couple of different companies and done a lot of consulting work on gene  
**[0:06:57-0:06:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:57):**  editing.  And so one of the big differences is that we can do a lot of good consumer traits with  gene editing.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:04):**  And so if you lead with a trait that consumers want, like if you have better taste in strawberries  or a pitless cherry or foods that are more convenient, foods that are more nutritious,  foods that have a better sustainability story that you communicate correctly, I think consumers  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:21):**  are going to come along.  And I think it's possible, like through COVID and some people getting a better understanding  of science and what science can really do to help us, that there's going to be a more  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:32):**  openness to what is science doing for our food in a way that's helping me.  So I'm hopeful and I think we're trying to do the right things with gene editing of this  really can help with climate change.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:44):**  I mean, so many crops are going to have to be grown in different places or different  varieties or grown differently because of climate change.  And this is the way that this is one way that we can do something about that.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:56):**  What's the conversation like with growers?  You're now at PMA and you'd be talking to companies that are on the production side  and marketing side as well, thinking about how to have these conversations, but also  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:05):**  what technologies to invest in and adopt and which ones maybe to wait a little longer and  kind of see how it goes.  What's the sense from industry around gene editing in particular, but kind of ag tech  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:15):**  more broadly?  I think with gene editing, there's a real fear of production, breeding and production  companies that they don't want to be first.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:23):**  They don't want to be the ones that the consumer says, oh, you know, you're the biggest blueberry  company and we know that you're using gene editing.  We're not going to buy it and they don't want the blowback.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:33):**  And so I think we're in this really funny state right now because lots of companies  are using gene editing in their breeding programs, but they're keeping it very separate.  So you don't hear me.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:46):**  It is not mixing.  People are not doing it on the slide, but they're keeping very separate breeding programs  just to see what the technology can do.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:55):**  But they're afraid because they don't want the consumer backlash.  And so I think there's companies like PearWise that's in North Carolina that's doing a lot  of breeding in produce.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:06):**  And they're straight up front like that's what we are, we're a breeding company.  We use gene editing and we're going to come out with these four crops.  And I think companies like that being out in front and seeing what the benefits are  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:18):**  is going to help and it's going to produce or be willing to grow it if there's pull on  the other side.  And I think one of the examples that I use and other people use this too is looking at  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:28):**  like Impossible Foods and the Impossible Burger.  So that is GMO soy and they use a heme protein that's made in a genetically modified yeast  and people can't get enough.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:40):**  And they're going to IPO, they're going to really be big.  And so I think if you can be up front, be transparent with consumers and give them something  they really want, then that's going to bring things forward.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:53):**  How do you think that gene editing will change or will it change the supply chain dynamics  and kind of who owns what part of the industry?  Like does ownership change when these more companies have access to gene editing or can  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:05):**  differentiate in different ways at different parts of the supply chain?  Like does it actually shift how traditional lines have been drawn in terms of who does  breeding and then who does growing and who does marketing?  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:16):**  Do you see more vertical integration, more fragmentation?  That's a really interesting question.  I think in a lot of, you know, if you look at corn and soy now, you have big, you know,  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:27):**  broad acre crops.  I mean, you have people that do the science and own the germplasm and sell the seeds.  Those crops, I don't think it's going to change.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:35):**  I think it'll be interesting in some of the crops that I work in more in the produce area  because those companies that have the germplasm probably aren't going to invest in the tools  and hiring the people to do that work.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:49):**  And I've done some projects with a variety of people trying to look at, okay, say we  want to do gene editing and table grapes.  How do we do it?  
**[0:10:57-0:10:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:57):**  Like how do we even do it?  It makes sense to me for it to stay separate and for there to be like platform based companies  that do genome mapping and that do the actual edits and that test in the greenhouse.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:10):**  And I'm hoping that those companies stay separate from the germplasm companies because it just  doesn't make sense for say a great producer to make big investments in that type of technology  that should be a separate platform company.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:25):**  And as far as the, like how the value goes, you know, that's what these companies have  to look at, like who captures the value and where's that value captured.  And that's a lot of what these companies that are doing the breeding, they're like, how  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:38):**  do I get to capture the value that happens at the Kroger store?  Like how do I get that value?  And so that is something that I think everyone's trying to work out as if you're capturing  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:50):**  consumer value, how does that go back to the genetics company?  And that isn't worked out yet, but I think those are going to be interesting conversations.  These questions like who pays and what business models will win are not just playing out with  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:03):**  gene editing, but also with all kinds of emerging technologies in food and ag.  Soil carbon markets are another very hot example.  Yeah, I listened to your last podcast that was talking about carbon, which was fabulous  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:16):**  because it's such a hot area.  And there are some parallels, I think, in just trying to figure out who owns what and  where does the value accrue.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:25):**  I think it's a little different because it's right now that whole breed and all of that  is just, it's better set up.  It's more established.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:34):**  And I think with carbon markets, it's a wild west right now of like, what are we trying  to do and what is the government going to do and what are the tools we're going to use  and how do we affect this huge system?  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:45):**  You can't just have something that measures soil carbon and that's all you have.  You have to have this whole system that it fits in.  And so I think that's the broader thing with carbon that I think is pretty fascinating.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:59):**  You've drawn parallels to biofuels and I'm really curious to hear your thinking there.  And I would say probably U.S. listeners are decently familiar with biofuels and what's  happened, maybe international listeners or Australian listeners less so.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:11):**  So maybe give us a little bit of a one-on-one there and why you see parallels with carbon.  All right.  So I, when I was talking about my history, so Agtech ended up consolidating into a very  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:21):**  small number of companies.  And so I was off looking for the next thing because I didn't want to work for another  Monsanto and I really wanted to stay in more cutting edge technology.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:30):**  And so this was in the early 2000s, like 2004, and everyone was really looking for, you know,  we need a different source.  We need something besides oil and gas because the prices were going up so high.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:45):**  And so everyone started looking at biofuels.  And first it was corn ethanol, which I was personally less interested in just because  there was no great technology leaps we were going to have there.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:54):**  And so we started looking at second generation fuels is what I ended up working on for 10  years of my career.  And that was taking either crop residue or crops that were grown specifically for energy  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:07):**  crops like sorghum and switchgrass and scampus, it's a number of others that were grown to  make biofuels.  And so this kind of got going.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:15):**  And this was one of the parallels that I was thinking about with carbon is like, so in  2007, then President Bush made a comment in the State of the Union address about switchgrass.  And then suddenly, like switchgrass was a thing and everyone was working on switchgrass.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:31):**  And the government started putting so much money and said that there was going to be  35 billion gallons of ethanol by 2017 that was going to be made and and half of that  was going to be from second generation fuels.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:43):**  So lots of money started pouring in and people who'd been very quietly, you know, studying  switchgrass and some of these other things, you know, just they were in the limelight.  And so much money went into this.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:54):**  So the US government tried to create this market by saying you're going to produce this  amount of fuel and they put a bunch of money and they picked companies to put money in.  So in 2007, they invested over a billion dollars into developing the technology for this, but  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:08):**  they started, they started with the technology at a really high level, they said build these  gigantic plants.  And my job at the time I was working for DuPont and I was in charge of a program that we were  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:21):**  looking at converting corn stover into fuel.  And I had, it was a beaker in a lab.  Like that's, that's where my technology was.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:31):**  It was a beaker, you know, fermenting in a lab and people were saying, here's a check  for a hundred million dollars, go build a, you know, a hundred million gallon ethanol  plant.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:41):**  So it was a, it was a lot of push without really looking at the system with, you know,  one without looking at what technology do we need?  What's the state of technology and what's, what entire system do we need to change for  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:51):**  this to work?  And then letting the government pick winners and losers.  So I think when we look at carbon now, that's, that's, you know, the government's got to  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:00):**  be involved because they set admissions, they, you know, they set a lot of the standards,  so the government's going to be involved, but how do we make sure that we're going after  this in the right way and we're not getting too far ahead, putting too much money in when  
**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:13):**  the technology is not ready?  Hmm.  And do you see parallels now with like Biden's talk about climate change and possible carbon  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:19):**  bank and the conversations today?  Yeah.  And that's what kind of, you know, it's like, ah, you know, I've lived this before.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:27):**  And so I've actually very interested in it and I'm starting to dig deep into it too,  just because it is, it is the next shiny thing, you know?  And so I'm really interested in, and have talked to a number of startups that are thinking  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:41):**  about different ways of doing things and how do you measure?  And I'm putting together some conversations at PMA about how do we get the people that  are thinking about it?  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:49):**  You know, like some of the people you've had on your podcast, you know, from Cargill and  from General Mills and those people that are having those conversations, how do we talk  to produce about that?  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:57):**  You know, how does the produce get involved in it and how to, how do they get something  out of it?  How do they not go down the wrong path?  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:03):**  How do they make money, not lose money?  So yeah, I think it's a, it's a very exciting time, but there's, there's a lot of pitfalls  and just, you know, fools rush in.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:14):**  I mean, the amount of money that the government may put in the wrong place and, you know,  here in the US when suddenly all of the venture capitalists are trying to string together  the carbon buzzwords and, you know, fun things, I think we just, you know, need to be kind  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:29):**  of cautious.  100%.  I talked to an investor this week who was saying, wow, you guys are really understanding  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:34):**  this carbon stuff.  You know, great to hear it on the podcast.  You've made the investment in Nori.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:38):**  We just feel like we don't know enough yet and we're going to always be behind the curve  because it's moving so fast and the people that are on the top of the wave are just going  to stay on the top of the wave.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:46):**  And so we'll just stay out, which I thought was really interesting versus others who are  like all in.  And so you're almost already seeing the kind of fragmentation and whether more capital  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:55):**  will come in or everyone will go out too confusing, just see what happens and let it crash or  actually this is really big.  We need to get involved.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:01):**  So we'll, we'll see, I guess.  Well, I think, you know, at least in the US when the government starts putting money in,  then I think that gets investors interested and will, you know, they'll start pushing  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:13):**  along because they'll know that that money's there.  And so, you know, a lot of what happened with biofuels is there was a company called Range  Fuels that they, I think they got, I don't know, I'm going to get the exact numbers long,  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:24):**  but it's around 200 million from the government.  And then Vinod Khosla came in and put in a whole bunch more money.  And so I think that pushes things along.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:32):**  And so I think in the US, you know, with all the people looking at climate change and,  you know, the DOE will.  So it just, it kind of mitigates the risks a little bit for some investors.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:40):**  So I think, I think we will see, you know, investors rushing in and I, you know, hopefully  we're just smarter about it because it's a good, I mean, we're solving a very important  problem.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:51):**  I don't want to make it sound like I think it's, you know, the wrong thing to do.  It's just, you know, cautionary.  Yeah.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:55):**  That's kind of what I was going to ask is how do we balance the sense of potential hyper  frothiness with the actual need to have solutions to climate change, like writ large period,  but also ones that enable growers to be profitable and meaningfully participate?  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:11):**  Any kind of thinking on how growers can and should be getting involved, especially in  produce?  Yeah, I think that's something I'm exploring right now.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:21):**  I, cause I certainly don't want to get people involved with, you know, here, buy this, buy  this other new tool, you know, or try this other new thing.  And you're already, you're already putting the risk and the cost on the grower.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:33):**  And you know, we've talked about this before that that's, that's not where it belongs.  And so how do, how do we incentivize them in a way that makes them interested in that  it mitigates the risk from them?  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:44):**  And so I think with carbon sequestration, you know, look at trees.  I mean, you look at all the trees that grow produce and like that, that's a pretty good  deal.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:54):**  You know, you've got a lot of carbon that stay in there for a long time.  And so we should be able to figure out a way that if that's what we're looking to do is  it to reward that, you know, then there should be a way to do that without them having to  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:07):**  bear a lot of costs.  So it is something that I'm exploring right now.  And I, I don't know the answer and because the carbon systems that are getting set up,  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:16):**  you know, through places like Indigo and FBN and some of the commercial carbon systems  aren't really looking at the produce industry.  And so I just want to be cautious to not get people into something that, that then ends  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:30):**  up being so much work and so much time just trying to figure out what tools do I use to  measure it and, you know, filling out the forms.  It's not worth it.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:40):**  That's for sure.  The number one thing we see in here from growers is the sense of it's a lot of work for a very  uncertain benefit other than the practices that I can do that improve soil health and  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:50):**  create a more productive farm and all those things obviously make sense.  But any of this exploration of other credits or markets feels a bit tenuous right now,  especially in produce.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:58):**  Maybe I'll just wait where we have seen a difference is when it could be consumer facing  like wine brands, for example, looking at branding as a carbon neutral winery or when  they actually have that connection to consumers, especially around sustainability.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:10):**  What are you kind of seeing in that space?  Certainly with consumer facing brands where you can tell that story, then there's going  to be a real plus there of how to tell that story and consumers hopefully will pay for  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:24):**  it.  I've not seen, I'm trying to think of anything that I've seen that is specifically pulling  through yet.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:31):**  And consumers, I mean, we've found this on everything.  You put a bunch of people in a focus group and you and I would be guilty as well.  It's not saying anything negative about anybody, but you say, oh, would you pay more for this  
**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:41):**  great benefit?  Of course I would.  But then you put them in front of a shelf and you look at their basket and they really  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:46):**  won't.  So, we say this about to startups who are testing their market where it's like the diet  question when you say, would you like to have a six pack and a beach body and all these  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:56):**  things like, yes, of course.  Great.  And you give them the celery versus the cheeseburger and they choose the cheeseburger every time.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:01):**  It's like what people say they'll do is not actually what they'll do.  And that's pretty challenging.  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:07):**  For a while I was working in biocontrols and it was a consumer brand.  And so we had a number of biocontrol consumer brands and we put them in the aisle of the  garden stores and these things did, they were before their time, they did not sell.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:21):**  And so we started saying, people want legs up.  People want to see bugs legs up.  So I think it's hard.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:28):**  And I think that we see this in all sorts of back care companies.  You see this as well is that people go and they talk to two or three really forward thinking  producers and then they think, okay, I can base a business on this.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:41):**  And it doesn't always work out that way.  You mentioned biocontrols.  I'm really curious what you're seeing in this space is the time now for that.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:48):**  And it's exactly, as you said, a kind of psychology problem with some of these products.  Does it actually work?  How do we know?  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:54):**  And what are you seeing in terms of solving that psychological problem and just bio inputs,  I guess, more broadly as the time come?  Yeah, I think the time has come, I think for several reasons.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:04):**  One is the reason that you say is that we're actually able to measure it now much better  than we were 15, 20 years ago.  And the products have gotten so much better.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:13):**  They've gotten a lot more specific and they just work better.  And I think also because we're starting to see resistance and, you know, a lot of like  insecticides and fungicides and then, and some of the biocontrols don't have that resistance  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:25):**  and, and maybe it's not, you can stop using pesticides completely, but you can, you know,  you can mix them so that you can use those other chemicals a little bit longer at that  cause they don't build up resistance.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:35):**  So I do think that time is now and I think it's really exciting.  So I beat my head against that one for about five years and it just partly is just products  just weren't good enough.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:45):**  So, you know, you have to have a product that works, but I think, I think they are now.  And, and I think just it, you know, with all the, all we're looking at in the soil and  using microbials in the soil and all the things that we can do and test and understand what's  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:00):**  happening in the soil, I think it's really positive.  That's an exciting area.  Vani's also excited for the future of plant breeding, which has always been her first  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:08):**  passion since the greenhouse days, but now she sees breeding as a critical tool to help  meet some of the big climate challenges we're facing.  So you're going to have a lot of issues where you're not going to have as much water if  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:19):**  it's not, you know, places that aren't irrigated or even if they are irrigated and you won't  have enough water to put on.  So I think certainly drought resistance is a big one.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:27):**  I think there's gonna be areas that are gonna freeze where they didn't freeze or not freeze  where they used to freeze.  And so, you know, that's, that was, that's why blueberries expanded.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:38):**  You know, why, why they did was through genetics where you could grow them where you couldn't  grow before.  And that was in GMO.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:43):**  That's just genetics.  So I think there's a lot of just the climates are changing, you know, hotter and colder  and wetter and drier, and we need to be able to respond to those.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:53):**  And breeding is a great way to, to be able to do that.  Storm events, you know, too much, too much water or too much wind, or, you know, all  sorts of pests that blow in that weren't there before, you know, what kind of resistance  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:06):**  can you get?  So I think there's, there's a lot of, you know, breeding takes a little longer, but  I don't know, developing a new pesticide takes a long time too.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:14):**  But breeding is, you know, is just kind of a better way if you can, if you can do it  through breeding.  Yeah.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:19):**  And do you see one of the things we've dug into is this kind of changing landscape due  to climate change and how these weather events will be more extreme, but also certain things  won't be able to be produced in certain areas or other things will be able to produce there  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:31):**  that weren't, but we don't have the supply chain infrastructure.  Do you see this combination of new breeding technologies and pressures from climate re-engineering  landscapes like changing what it means to be a farmer?  
**[0:25:44-0:25:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:44):**  Like our company's gonna have to move locations.  Will they have stranded assets and have to do something else with them?  Like what's the kind of shift in again, how the structure of the industry or even what  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:52):**  the landscape looks like might be?  I think that's likely to happen, you know, maybe over a longer period of time, but I  think one of the things that's happening anyway is that people are starting to think about  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:03):**  monoculture and do I really want to just be growing this one crop and, you know, maybe  I can grow different crops.  And I think that's going to continue to happen.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:11):**  And that's climate change and just doing this much corn.  I think that's and it's just my view, but I think that's going to happen slow enough  that the supply chain can kind of react to that.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:22):**  It's not going to be like you're gonna have to change this tomorrow.  Right.  And how about other countries getting involved in this?  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:28):**  Like we've done a little bit of work looking at the Middle East and obviously Singapore  has massive food security goals.  Some other countries are looking at how do we think about food security?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:37):**  How do we think about breeding and using these technologies to grow things here that we maybe  couldn't or now that we have to?  Is that a trend you're seeing?  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:44):**  Well, certainly I've been having conversations in Singapore this week and so they import  90 percent of their food.  And especially during covid, like this was a very scary time for them.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:53):**  And so the government has started to pump quite a bit of money into looking at eggs,  fish and vegetables are the three areas.  And they're trying to produce 30 percent of their food in Singapore by 2030 and putting  
**[0:27:08-0:27:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:08):**  lots of systems in place.  And it's vertical, like all they can do is vertical.  Like they can't go out.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:14):**  You know, they have to go up.  And they were one guy.  Yeah.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:19):**  One guy was telling me about they're doing like vertical sheep farming, which I just  can't imagine.  But, you know, there some of them are on the 20th floor.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:28):**  But that's certainly happening in Singapore where they're looking at using different technologies.  And I think countries like Brazil are certainly adopting a lot of different technologies and  looking at what else can grow, how can we grow it, how can we do this better?  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:41):**  So it's certainly happening globally.  Vani also predicts a shake up in some of the traditional food supply chains.  And so when you look at the whole supply chain, starting from that first mile of like leaving  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:55):**  the farm gate, getting all the way to retailer food service in the produce industry and like  all, all that needs to happen there.  And I don't know if you've seen it, the landscape map on the supply chain that Shana Day and  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:09):**  Britta Rosenheim have done.  It's amazing how many different companies are in there.  And they really looked at the different verticals.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:16):**  And how do we do supply chain that works?  You know, that really goes all the way from the farmer to the retailer and what kind of  systems need to be in place.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:23):**  And there's all sorts of systems that, you know, computer vision systems and just the  traceability that's important.  And so I think that's an area that's really under invested in and super important.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:38):**  And especially, I think, since covid really exposed how scary that supply chain is, I  think people are starting to look at it differently.  And I was talking to a company the other day, Swarm Engineering, and it's a bunch of guys  
**[0:28:49-0:28:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:49):**  from Microsoft.  And they're really looking at how do we do the logistics system all the way through and  figure out how to save money and really support the industry.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:01):**  And so I think that's an area not exactly the area I know the most about, but I think  it's a really important area for food to really understand, you know, how can we do things  there?  
**[0:29:13-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:13):**  There's so much going on in the field.  And a lot of the, and I know you guys work in this area a lot, a lot of the robotics  and the automation and artificial intelligence and then what's happening in the field.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:23):**  And I was talking to a company the other day about this and I almost had this feeling of,  oh, yeah, this.  And it's so ridiculous that I'm thinking that this is just like old hat, you know, because  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:35):**  it's amazing.  You know, it's amazing what they're doing.  And I think it's, you know, the adoption on that is going to be slower.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:41):**  I think it may be faster in some ways in produce because the farms are smaller and the information  is more valuable.  But it is amazing what's happening, like being able to know exactly when to pick and knowing  
**[0:29:52-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:52):**  exactly which apple flowers to reduce so that you have a better crop and really using AI  to be able to see almost every plant and make a decision on, you know, how to treat that.  So it's pretty amazing.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:04):**  Yeah.  We're actually seeing that connect to the supply chain point you made before where when  you have more information about what's happening in the field, what does that mean for how  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:12):**  you can re-engineer the supply chain?  Do you need as much cold chain infrastructure or do you need different kinds of logistics  support when you know basically ahead of time what you're going to pick or when it's going  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:22):**  to be ready or what you're going to do in the field that's going to be highly responsive  to what consumers want and on demand?  Does that actually change how supply chains look and work?  
**[0:30:32-0:30:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:32):**  And to your point before, who creates and captures value?  That's an area we're really excited about.  Yeah.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:38):**  And so how do you look when you look at that whole what you just said, that whole piece,  I mean, how do you look at interoperability?  Like how do you talk to people about that and how that's, I think, one of the biggest  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:48):**  issues.  It's like you've got 20 dashboards and all those different pieces of data.  And so I guess just all industries go through a process of maturing and that fitting together.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:00):**  But have you seen anyone that's trying to kind of crack that?  Not, I mean, we've seen people trying to crack it both from like a we'll build dashboards  and we'll be a kind of power BI or whether they're ag tech specific or not, kind of aggregate  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:12):**  data and give you your view of it, which I think is interesting, probably hard to get  to venture scale, but useful tools that we see growers really, really appreciating right  now.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:20):**  There's I think a play around some kind of open source approach to creating the standards  and helping build the pipes in this space.  The challenge is there's a lot of initiatives doing that open ag data initiative and different  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:32):**  industry specific initiatives to say, here's how we talk about vine rows or here's how  we talk about rod acre cropping and what the farm looks like.  It really can be a whole of industry approach, but who has the incentive to do that?  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:43):**  Who wins?  And that's where we are increasingly thinking about open source.  How do you create the harness, the momentum of the community to build those tools, but  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:52):**  you can still have a venture scale business model, which I think you do need and world  class tech and software talent because it really is a tech play.  But right now we're in the kind of early stage of industry maturity where everyone's building  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:32:03):**  their own APIs, doing their own work to connect the dots.  And that just makes it more confusing.  But over time, I think we'll see more standards and more pipes being built and there are opportunities  
**[0:32:13-0:32:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:32:13):**  there for sure.  Yeah.  So do you think that, sorry, I'm interviewing you now.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:32:20):**  So do you think that's five years?  Do you think that's eight years?  I mean, yeah, I mean, we, we haven't seen any companies that are doing that, that we  
**[0:32:28-0:32:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:32:28):**  would necessarily bet on.  We're starting to see companies recognize that problem and think about how it might  be solved.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:32:33):**  So that's exciting.  And if you look at a venture timeframe, then, you know, maybe it's five years, three to  seven ideally for venture capital.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:32:40):**  But I would say we're, that's probably the next phase of industry maturity.  Yeah, that's great.  Yeah.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:32:46):**  It's, it's, it has to happen and it happens in other industries, but it just, it's hard  to get a site on like how long that's going to take and how everybody fits into that.  And that's it for another episode of AgTech So What.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:33:01):**  Thanks for listening.  But before you go, Vani also has her own podcast looking at innovations in the produce industry.  It's called PMA Takes On Tech and it's definitely worth a listen.

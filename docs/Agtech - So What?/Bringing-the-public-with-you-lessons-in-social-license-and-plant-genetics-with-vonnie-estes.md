### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 21 Apr 2021 20:01:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Ag Tech So What, brought to you by the Agthente Group.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:06):**  I'm your host, Sarah Nollet.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:08):**  I'm really excited about today's guest, Vani Estes.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:11):**  Not only is she an industry leader in food and ag, but she's also refreshingly candid  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:16):**  about her own experiences working for large and small ag and food companies.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:20):**  This is Vani, remembering the US biofuels craze of the mid 2000s.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:25):**  They said build these gigantic plants and my job at the time I was working for DuPont  
**[0:00:31-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:31):**  and I was in charge of a program that we were looking at converting corn stover into fuel  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:38):**  and I had, it was a beaker in a lab.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:41):**  Like that's where my technology was.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:44):**  It was a beaker, you know, fermenting in a lab and people were saying, here's a check  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:48):**  for a hundred million dollars, go build a hundred million gallon ethanol plant.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:54):**  So it was a lot of push without really looking at the system.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:00:58):**  These days, Vani is the vice president of technology at the Produce Marketing Association  
**[0:01:02-0:01:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:02):**  or PMA.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:03):**  Her role is to help fruit and vegetable growers in industry to adopt and integrate new technologies.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:08):**  Previously Vani's worked for Monsanto, Syngenta and with numerous ag and biotech startups.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:14):**  In this episode, you'll hear some of the hard lessons she's learned along the way, what  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:17):**  the future of gene editing might look like and the parallels between the hype around  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:21):**  biofuels two decades ago and the hype around soil carbon today.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:25):**  But first, this is how Vani came to join the ag and food world.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:31):**  So I got my undergraduate degree from New Mexico State University in horticulture and  
**[0:01:36-0:01:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:36):**  worked for a little bit in greenhouses and realized that I was never going to pay any  
**[0:01:42-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:42):**  bills working in greenhouses.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:44):**  But I did have kind of that early experience of working in indoor ag as a greenhouse.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:49):**  And then I went to UC Davis and got my master's degree in plant pathology.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:56):**  And so that was kind of the beginning of that.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:01:58):**  And my first job out of graduate school was working with a company called DNA Plant Technologies,  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:03):**  which was one of the very early genetically engineering plant companies that it doesn't  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:09):**  exist anymore.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:10):**  But that was a really exciting time.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:13):**  I got to be on very early stages of what was happening with genetic engineering and crops  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:17):**  and where that could go.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:20):**  And so for the next 15 years, I worked in kind of ag biotech in that whole area, really  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:25):**  on the cutting edge of what is this technology?  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:27):**  What can we do with it?  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:28):**  How can we grow more sustainably?  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:30):**  How can we make better crops?  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:33):**  So that was a really exciting time working.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:36):**  I worked for Dnap, like I said, and a company called Paradigm Genetics and worked for Monsanto  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:42):**  for a while and also worked for a company that was buying seed companies all over the  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:48):**  world and helping integrate some traits into those.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:52):**  Vani was at Monsanto in the mid 1990s.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:54):**  It was a time when Roundup could be found in garages across suburbia, used commonly  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:02:58):**  as a spray for weeds.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:00):**  But for agriculture, the 90s brought about major leaps in biotech when Monsanto introduced  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:05):**  the first Roundup ready seeds in soybeans, corn and cotton using genetic modification.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:10):**  At the time, the science was revolutionary, but no one imagined how much pushback there'd  
**[0:03:15-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:15):**  be against GMOs.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:16):**  Vani was right in the middle of this and learned a lot about social license.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:21):**  Now when you say you work for Monsanto, like everybody cringes.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:24):**  So that was in the mid 90s.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:26):**  And I know there's, I'm sure there are conversations in the boardroom that are different than this,  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:30):**  but for me being there, it was, we had these cool tools.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:34):**  We can do these really cool things so that you don't have to spray insecticide and so  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:38):**  that you don't have to till and so that you can do all these other things that are more  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:42):**  sustainable.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:43):**  So the conversations internally were like, this is really cool stuff and this is going  
**[0:03:48-0:03:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:48):**  to allow us to grow more sustainably.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:50):**  So that was the conversation.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:52):**  And what we completely missed out of arrogance certainly was that we kind of needed to bring  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:03:59):**  people along with us in that little journey of that thought process.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:04):**  And so when it wasn't communicated to consumers in a good way and consumers certainly didn't  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:11):**  see any benefit for them in BT Cotton, then that's when a lot of the problems happened.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:17):**  But it's really interesting to think back on, to me, it was quite exciting that the  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:21):**  technology could do this and really seeing the missteps that happen from a communication  
**[0:04:26-0:04:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:26):**  social license point of view.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:28):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:29):**  Was there ever a moment or a story of consumer pushback or something happening where you  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:34):**  started to realize maybe you got it wrong or that how you guys were thinking about it  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:37):**  internally was really different than how the world was seeing it?  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:40):**  Yeah, actually, I'll tell you a more recent story that even reflects on me worse.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:46):**  So I was up in Washington State, summer before last, before COVID and we were still traveling.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:54):**  And I was talking, we were doing grower visits and we did a dinner with a bunch of apple  
**[0:04:59-0:05:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:04:59):**  growers.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:00):**  And I was talking about the Arctic apple, which is a GMO apple, right?  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:05):**  And non-browning, great sustainability food waste story.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:08):**  I think they've done a pretty good job of communicating to consumers.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:12):**  They don't hide it.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:13):**  They tell people this is GMO.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:15):**  And so we're at this brewery outside.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:18):**  There's like hops growing in the background.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:19):**  It was really beautiful.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:21):**  And so I started talking about technology because that's my job.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:23):**  So I'm talking about technology and there's all these great technology and then it's coming  
**[0:05:26-0:05:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:26):**  to apples and I start talking about the Arctic apple and I just see the room just go dead.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:34):**  Well, it was outside, but I see the group go dead and the eyes like daggers.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:38):**  And I'm like, this is very familiar.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:41):**  I remember this and I just, of all people I should know not to bring up a topic like  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:48):**  that until you really understand how it affects the people in the room and what their feelings  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:52):**  were.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:05:53):**  And my feeling about it was that before Arctic apple, when they were trading outside the

**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:03):**  is this GMO?  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:04):**  And so that was one of, they said, we're getting hit, we're getting the negatives and not the  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:09):**  positives about this.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:11):**  So that was an interesting flash forward 20 years later that you really need to pay attention  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:17):**  to who you're talking to and how you talk to them about technology and food.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:20):**  Yeah, my sense is that the industry hasn't fully learned this lesson and because it's  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:25):**  not an easy one to learn that we say now, Oh, we need to listen more and we need to  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:28):**  have more conversations and highlight the benefits.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:31):**  And then we sort of do that, but the response isn't really all that different.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:35):**  And yet at the same time, there's lots of research about how agriculture is really trusted  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:38):**  and we have all this goodwill and people do believe in farmers.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:41):**  So I guess my sense is, I don't know what we do differently.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:44):**  Do you have a good sense of how to do this differently or any hope around what's changing?  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:49):**  Well, I think we've got another opportunity with gene editing and I've worked in gene  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:53):**  editing at a couple of different companies and done a lot of consulting work on gene  
**[0:06:57-0:06:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:57):**  editing.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:06:58):**  And so one of the big differences is that we can do a lot of good consumer traits with  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:03):**  gene editing.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:04):**  And so if you lead with a trait that consumers want, like if you have better taste in strawberries  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:11):**  or a pitless cherry or foods that are more convenient, foods that are more nutritious,  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:17):**  foods that have a better sustainability story that you communicate correctly, I think consumers  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:21):**  are going to come along.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:23):**  And I think it's possible, like through COVID and some people getting a better understanding  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:29):**  of science and what science can really do to help us, that there's going to be a more  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:32):**  openness to what is science doing for our food in a way that's helping me.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:37):**  So I'm hopeful and I think we're trying to do the right things with gene editing of this  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:42):**  really can help with climate change.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:44):**  I mean, so many crops are going to have to be grown in different places or different  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:49):**  varieties or grown differently because of climate change.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:52):**  And this is the way that this is one way that we can do something about that.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:56):**  What's the conversation like with growers?  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:07:58):**  You're now at PMA and you'd be talking to companies that are on the production side  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:01):**  and marketing side as well, thinking about how to have these conversations, but also  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:05):**  what technologies to invest in and adopt and which ones maybe to wait a little longer and  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:10):**  kind of see how it goes.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:11):**  What's the sense from industry around gene editing in particular, but kind of ag tech  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:15):**  more broadly?  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:16):**  I think with gene editing, there's a real fear of production, breeding and production  
**[0:08:21-0:08:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:21):**  companies that they don't want to be first.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:23):**  They don't want to be the ones that the consumer says, oh, you know, you're the biggest blueberry  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:28):**  company and we know that you're using gene editing.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:31):**  We're not going to buy it and they don't want the blowback.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:33):**  And so I think we're in this really funny state right now because lots of companies  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:39):**  are using gene editing in their breeding programs, but they're keeping it very separate.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:44):**  So you don't hear me.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:46):**  It is not mixing.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:48):**  People are not doing it on the slide, but they're keeping very separate breeding programs  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:52):**  just to see what the technology can do.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:55):**  But they're afraid because they don't want the consumer backlash.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:08:58):**  And so I think there's companies like PearWise that's in North Carolina that's doing a lot  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:03):**  of breeding in produce.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:06):**  And they're straight up front like that's what we are, we're a breeding company.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:08):**  We use gene editing and we're going to come out with these four crops.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:12):**  And I think companies like that being out in front and seeing what the benefits are  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:18):**  is going to help and it's going to produce or be willing to grow it if there's pull on  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:23):**  the other side.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:24):**  And I think one of the examples that I use and other people use this too is looking at  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:28):**  like Impossible Foods and the Impossible Burger.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:30):**  So that is GMO soy and they use a heme protein that's made in a genetically modified yeast  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:38):**  and people can't get enough.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:40):**  And they're going to IPO, they're going to really be big.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:43):**  And so I think if you can be up front, be transparent with consumers and give them something  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:48):**  they really want, then that's going to bring things forward.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:53):**  How do you think that gene editing will change or will it change the supply chain dynamics  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:09:59):**  and kind of who owns what part of the industry?  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:01):**  Like does ownership change when these more companies have access to gene editing or can  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:05):**  differentiate in different ways at different parts of the supply chain?  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:08):**  Like does it actually shift how traditional lines have been drawn in terms of who does  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:13):**  breeding and then who does growing and who does marketing?  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:16):**  Do you see more vertical integration, more fragmentation?  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:19):**  That's a really interesting question.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:21):**  I think in a lot of, you know, if you look at corn and soy now, you have big, you know,  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:27):**  broad acre crops.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:28):**  I mean, you have people that do the science and own the germplasm and sell the seeds.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:33):**  Those crops, I don't think it's going to change.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:35):**  I think it'll be interesting in some of the crops that I work in more in the produce area  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:39):**  because those companies that have the germplasm probably aren't going to invest in the tools  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:46):**  and hiring the people to do that work.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:49):**  And I've done some projects with a variety of people trying to look at, okay, say we  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:54):**  want to do gene editing and table grapes.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:56):**  How do we do it?  
**[0:10:57-0:10:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:57):**  Like how do we even do it?  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:10:59):**  It makes sense to me for it to stay separate and for there to be like platform based companies  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:05):**  that do genome mapping and that do the actual edits and that test in the greenhouse.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:10):**  And I'm hoping that those companies stay separate from the germplasm companies because it just  
**[0:11:14-0:11:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:14):**  doesn't make sense for say a great producer to make big investments in that type of technology  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:22):**  that should be a separate platform company.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:25):**  And as far as the, like how the value goes, you know, that's what these companies have  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:30):**  to look at, like who captures the value and where's that value captured.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:34):**  And that's a lot of what these companies that are doing the breeding, they're like, how  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:38):**  do I get to capture the value that happens at the Kroger store?  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:44):**  Like how do I get that value?  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:46):**  And so that is something that I think everyone's trying to work out as if you're capturing  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:50):**  consumer value, how does that go back to the genetics company?  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:54):**  And that isn't worked out yet, but I think those are going to be interesting conversations.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:11:59):**  These questions like who pays and what business models will win are not just playing out with  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:03):**  gene editing, but also with all kinds of emerging technologies in food and ag.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:08):**  Soil carbon markets are another very hot example.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:11):**  Yeah, I listened to your last podcast that was talking about carbon, which was fabulous  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:16):**  because it's such a hot area.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:18):**  And there are some parallels, I think, in just trying to figure out who owns what and  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:23):**  where does the value accrue.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:25):**  I think it's a little different because it's right now that whole breed and all of that  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:31):**  is just, it's better set up.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:33):**  It's more established.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:34):**  And I think with carbon markets, it's a wild west right now of like, what are we trying  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:38):**  to do and what is the government going to do and what are the tools we're going to use  
**[0:12:42-0:12:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:42):**  and how do we affect this huge system?  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:45):**  You can't just have something that measures soil carbon and that's all you have.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:50):**  You have to have this whole system that it fits in.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:53):**  And so I think that's the broader thing with carbon that I think is pretty fascinating.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:12:59):**  You've drawn parallels to biofuels and I'm really curious to hear your thinking there.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:03):**  And I would say probably U.S. listeners are decently familiar with biofuels and what's  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:08):**  happened, maybe international listeners or Australian listeners less so.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:11):**  So maybe give us a little bit of a one-on-one there and why you see parallels with carbon.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:15):**  All right.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:16):**  So I, when I was talking about my history, so Agtech ended up consolidating into a very  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:21):**  small number of companies.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:22):**  And so I was off looking for the next thing because I didn't want to work for another  
**[0:13:27-0:13:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:27):**  Monsanto and I really wanted to stay in more cutting edge technology.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:30):**  And so this was in the early 2000s, like 2004, and everyone was really looking for, you know,  
**[0:13:38-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:38):**  we need a different source.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:40):**  We need something besides oil and gas because the prices were going up so high.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:45):**  And so everyone started looking at biofuels.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:47):**  And first it was corn ethanol, which I was personally less interested in just because  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:51):**  there was no great technology leaps we were going to have there.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:54):**  And so we started looking at second generation fuels is what I ended up working on for 10  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:13:59):**  years of my career.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:00):**  And that was taking either crop residue or crops that were grown specifically for energy  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:07):**  crops like sorghum and switchgrass and scampus, it's a number of others that were grown to  
**[0:14:12-0:14:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:12):**  make biofuels.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:13):**  And so this kind of got going.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:15):**  And this was one of the parallels that I was thinking about with carbon is like, so in  
**[0:14:20-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:20):**  2007, then President Bush made a comment in the State of the Union address about switchgrass.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:28):**  And then suddenly, like switchgrass was a thing and everyone was working on switchgrass.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:31):**  And the government started putting so much money and said that there was going to be  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:35):**  35 billion gallons of ethanol by 2017 that was going to be made and and half of that  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:40):**  was going to be from second generation fuels.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:43):**  So lots of money started pouring in and people who'd been very quietly, you know, studying  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:48):**  switchgrass and some of these other things, you know, just they were in the limelight.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:52):**  And so much money went into this.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:54):**  So the US government tried to create this market by saying you're going to produce this  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:14:58):**  amount of fuel and they put a bunch of money and they picked companies to put money in.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:03):**  So in 2007, they invested over a billion dollars into developing the technology for this, but  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:08):**  they started, they started with the technology at a really high level, they said build these  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:13):**  gigantic plants.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:15):**  And my job at the time I was working for DuPont and I was in charge of a program that we were  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:21):**  looking at converting corn stover into fuel.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:25):**  And I had, it was a beaker in a lab.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:28):**  Like that's, that's where my technology was.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:31):**  It was a beaker, you know, fermenting in a lab and people were saying, here's a check  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:35):**  for a hundred million dollars, go build a, you know, a hundred million gallon ethanol  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:40):**  plant.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:41):**  So it was a, it was a lot of push without really looking at the system with, you know,  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:44):**  one without looking at what technology do we need?  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:47):**  What's the state of technology and what's, what entire system do we need to change for  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:51):**  this to work?  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:53):**  And then letting the government pick winners and losers.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:15:56):**  So I think when we look at carbon now, that's, that's, you know, the government's got to  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:00):**  be involved because they set admissions, they, you know, they set a lot of the standards,  
**[0:16:04-0:16:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:04):**  so the government's going to be involved, but how do we make sure that we're going after  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:08):**  this in the right way and we're not getting too far ahead, putting too much money in when  
**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:13):**  the technology is not ready?  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:14):**  Hmm.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:15):**  And do you see parallels now with like Biden's talk about climate change and possible carbon  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:19):**  bank and the conversations today?  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:23):**  And that's what kind of, you know, it's like, ah, you know, I've lived this before.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:27):**  And so I've actually very interested in it and I'm starting to dig deep into it too,  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:32):**  just because it is, it is the next shiny thing, you know?  
**[0:16:35-0:16:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:35):**  And so I'm really interested in, and have talked to a number of startups that are thinking  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:41):**  about different ways of doing things and how do you measure?  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:44):**  And I'm putting together some conversations at PMA about how do we get the people that  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:48):**  are thinking about it?  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:49):**  You know, like some of the people you've had on your podcast, you know, from Cargill and  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:52):**  from General Mills and those people that are having those conversations, how do we talk  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:56):**  to produce about that?  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:16:57):**  You know, how does the produce get involved in it and how to, how do they get something  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:01):**  out of it?  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:02):**  How do they not go down the wrong path?  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:03):**  How do they make money, not lose money?  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:06):**  So yeah, I think it's a, it's a very exciting time, but there's, there's a lot of pitfalls  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:12):**  and just, you know, fools rush in.

**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:19):**  here in the US when suddenly all of the venture capitalists are trying to string together  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:24):**  the carbon buzzwords and, you know, fun things, I think we just, you know, need to be kind  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:29):**  of cautious.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:30):**  100%.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:31):**  I talked to an investor this week who was saying, wow, you guys are really understanding  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:34):**  this carbon stuff.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:35):**  You know, great to hear it on the podcast.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:36):**  You've made the investment in Nori.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:38):**  We just feel like we don't know enough yet and we're going to always be behind the curve  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:42):**  because it's moving so fast and the people that are on the top of the wave are just going  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:45):**  to stay on the top of the wave.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:46):**  And so we'll just stay out, which I thought was really interesting versus others who are  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:50):**  like all in.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:51):**  And so you're almost already seeing the kind of fragmentation and whether more capital  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:55):**  will come in or everyone will go out too confusing, just see what happens and let it crash or  
**[0:17:59-0:18:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:17:59):**  actually this is really big.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:00):**  We need to get involved.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:01):**  So we'll, we'll see, I guess.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:03):**  Well, I think, you know, at least in the US when the government starts putting money in,  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:08):**  then I think that gets investors interested and will, you know, they'll start pushing  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:13):**  along because they'll know that that money's there.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:16):**  And so, you know, a lot of what happened with biofuels is there was a company called Range  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:19):**  Fuels that they, I think they got, I don't know, I'm going to get the exact numbers long,  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:24):**  but it's around 200 million from the government.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:26):**  And then Vinod Khosla came in and put in a whole bunch more money.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:30):**  And so I think that pushes things along.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:32):**  And so I think in the US, you know, with all the people looking at climate change and,  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:36):**  you know, the DOE will.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:37):**  So it just, it kind of mitigates the risks a little bit for some investors.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:40):**  So I think, I think we will see, you know, investors rushing in and I, you know, hopefully  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:46):**  we're just smarter about it because it's a good, I mean, we're solving a very important  
**[0:18:50-0:18:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:50):**  problem.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:51):**  I don't want to make it sound like I think it's, you know, the wrong thing to do.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:53):**  It's just, you know, cautionary.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:18:55):**  That's kind of what I was going to ask is how do we balance the sense of potential hyper  
**[0:19:00-0:19:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:00):**  frothiness with the actual need to have solutions to climate change, like writ large period,  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:07):**  but also ones that enable growers to be profitable and meaningfully participate?  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:11):**  Any kind of thinking on how growers can and should be getting involved, especially in  
**[0:19:16-0:19:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:16):**  produce?  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:17):**  Yeah, I think that's something I'm exploring right now.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:21):**  I, cause I certainly don't want to get people involved with, you know, here, buy this, buy  
**[0:19:25-0:19:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:25):**  this other new tool, you know, or try this other new thing.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:28):**  And you're already, you're already putting the risk and the cost on the grower.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:33):**  And you know, we've talked about this before that that's, that's not where it belongs.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:36):**  And so how do, how do we incentivize them in a way that makes them interested in that  
**[0:19:42-0:19:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:42):**  it mitigates the risk from them?  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:44):**  And so I think with carbon sequestration, you know, look at trees.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:49):**  I mean, you look at all the trees that grow produce and like that, that's a pretty good  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:53):**  deal.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:54):**  You know, you've got a lot of carbon that stay in there for a long time.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:19:56):**  And so we should be able to figure out a way that if that's what we're looking to do is  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:03):**  it to reward that, you know, then there should be a way to do that without them having to  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:07):**  bear a lot of costs.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:08):**  So it is something that I'm exploring right now.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:11):**  And I, I don't know the answer and because the carbon systems that are getting set up,  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:16):**  you know, through places like Indigo and FBN and some of the commercial carbon systems  
**[0:20:22-0:20:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:22):**  aren't really looking at the produce industry.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:24):**  And so I just want to be cautious to not get people into something that, that then ends  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:30):**  up being so much work and so much time just trying to figure out what tools do I use to  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:36):**  measure it and, you know, filling out the forms.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:39):**  It's not worth it.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:40):**  That's for sure.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:41):**  The number one thing we see in here from growers is the sense of it's a lot of work for a very  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:45):**  uncertain benefit other than the practices that I can do that improve soil health and  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:50):**  create a more productive farm and all those things obviously make sense.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:53):**  But any of this exploration of other credits or markets feels a bit tenuous right now,  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:57):**  especially in produce.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:20:58):**  Maybe I'll just wait where we have seen a difference is when it could be consumer facing  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:02):**  like wine brands, for example, looking at branding as a carbon neutral winery or when  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:06):**  they actually have that connection to consumers, especially around sustainability.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:10):**  What are you kind of seeing in that space?  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:13):**  Certainly with consumer facing brands where you can tell that story, then there's going  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:19):**  to be a real plus there of how to tell that story and consumers hopefully will pay for  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:24):**  it.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:25):**  I've not seen, I'm trying to think of anything that I've seen that is specifically pulling  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:30):**  through yet.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:31):**  And consumers, I mean, we've found this on everything.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:34):**  You put a bunch of people in a focus group and you and I would be guilty as well.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:38):**  It's not saying anything negative about anybody, but you say, oh, would you pay more for this  
**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:41):**  great benefit?  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:42):**  Of course I would.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:43):**  But then you put them in front of a shelf and you look at their basket and they really  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:46):**  won't.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:47):**  So, we say this about to startups who are testing their market where it's like the diet  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:53):**  question when you say, would you like to have a six pack and a beach body and all these  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:56):**  things like, yes, of course.  
**[0:21:57-0:21:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:57):**  Great.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:21:58):**  And you give them the celery versus the cheeseburger and they choose the cheeseburger every time.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:01):**  It's like what people say they'll do is not actually what they'll do.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:03):**  And that's pretty challenging.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:05):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:07):**  For a while I was working in biocontrols and it was a consumer brand.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:10):**  And so we had a number of biocontrol consumer brands and we put them in the aisle of the  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:16):**  garden stores and these things did, they were before their time, they did not sell.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:21):**  And so we started saying, people want legs up.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:24):**  People want to see bugs legs up.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:26):**  So I think it's hard.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:28):**  And I think that we see this in all sorts of back care companies.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:31):**  You see this as well is that people go and they talk to two or three really forward thinking  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:38):**  producers and then they think, okay, I can base a business on this.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:41):**  And it doesn't always work out that way.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:43):**  You mentioned biocontrols.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:44):**  I'm really curious what you're seeing in this space is the time now for that.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:48):**  And it's exactly, as you said, a kind of psychology problem with some of these products.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:52):**  Does it actually work?  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:53):**  How do we know?  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:54):**  And what are you seeing in terms of solving that psychological problem and just bio inputs,  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:22:59):**  I guess, more broadly as the time come?  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:01):**  Yeah, I think the time has come, I think for several reasons.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:04):**  One is the reason that you say is that we're actually able to measure it now much better  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:08):**  than we were 15, 20 years ago.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:11):**  And the products have gotten so much better.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:13):**  They've gotten a lot more specific and they just work better.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:17):**  And I think also because we're starting to see resistance and, you know, a lot of like  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:21):**  insecticides and fungicides and then, and some of the biocontrols don't have that resistance  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:25):**  and, and maybe it's not, you can stop using pesticides completely, but you can, you know,  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:30):**  you can mix them so that you can use those other chemicals a little bit longer at that  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:34):**  cause they don't build up resistance.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:35):**  So I do think that time is now and I think it's really exciting.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:38):**  So I beat my head against that one for about five years and it just partly is just products  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:44):**  just weren't good enough.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:45):**  So, you know, you have to have a product that works, but I think, I think they are now.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:49):**  And, and I think just it, you know, with all the, all we're looking at in the soil and  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:23:54):**  using microbials in the soil and all the things that we can do and test and understand what's  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:00):**  happening in the soil, I think it's really positive.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:02):**  That's an exciting area.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:05):**  Vani's also excited for the future of plant breeding, which has always been her first  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:08):**  passion since the greenhouse days, but now she sees breeding as a critical tool to help  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:13):**  meet some of the big climate challenges we're facing.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:16):**  So you're going to have a lot of issues where you're not going to have as much water if  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:19):**  it's not, you know, places that aren't irrigated or even if they are irrigated and you won't  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:22):**  have enough water to put on.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:24):**  So I think certainly drought resistance is a big one.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:27):**  I think there's gonna be areas that are gonna freeze where they didn't freeze or not freeze  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:33):**  where they used to freeze.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:35):**  And so, you know, that's, that was, that's why blueberries expanded.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:38):**  You know, why, why they did was through genetics where you could grow them where you couldn't  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:41):**  grow before.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:42):**  And that was in GMO.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:43):**  That's just genetics.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:45):**  So I think there's a lot of just the climates are changing, you know, hotter and colder  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:50):**  and wetter and drier, and we need to be able to respond to those.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:53):**  And breeding is a great way to, to be able to do that.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:24:57):**  Storm events, you know, too much, too much water or too much wind, or, you know, all  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:02):**  sorts of pests that blow in that weren't there before, you know, what kind of resistance  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:06):**  can you get?  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:07):**  So I think there's, there's a lot of, you know, breeding takes a little longer, but  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:10):**  I don't know, developing a new pesticide takes a long time too.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:14):**  But breeding is, you know, is just kind of a better way if you can, if you can do it  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:17):**  through breeding.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:19):**  And do you see one of the things we've dug into is this kind of changing landscape due  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:22):**  to climate change and how these weather events will be more extreme, but also certain things  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:27):**  won't be able to be produced in certain areas or other things will be able to produce there  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:31):**  that weren't, but we don't have the supply chain infrastructure.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:34):**  Do you see this combination of new breeding technologies and pressures from climate re-engineering  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:39):**  landscapes like changing what it means to be a farmer?  
**[0:25:44-0:25:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:44):**  Like our company's gonna have to move locations.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:46):**  Will they have stranded assets and have to do something else with them?  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:48):**  Like what's the kind of shift in again, how the structure of the industry or even what  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:52):**  the landscape looks like might be?  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:55):**  I think that's likely to happen, you know, maybe over a longer period of time, but I  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:25:59):**  think one of the things that's happening anyway is that people are starting to think about  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:03):**  monoculture and do I really want to just be growing this one crop and, you know, maybe  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:07):**  I can grow different crops.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:08):**  And I think that's going to continue to happen.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:11):**  And that's climate change and just doing this much corn.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:14):**  I think that's and it's just my view, but I think that's going to happen slow enough  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:18):**  that the supply chain can kind of react to that.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:22):**  It's not going to be like you're gonna have to change this tomorrow.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:25):**  Right.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:26):**  And how about other countries getting involved in this?  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:28):**  Like we've done a little bit of work looking at the Middle East and obviously Singapore  
**[0:26:31-0:26:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:31):**  has massive food security goals.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:33):**  Some other countries are looking at how do we think about food security?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:37):**  How do we think about breeding and using these technologies to grow things here that we maybe  
**[0:26:40-0:26:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:40):**  couldn't or now that we have to?  
**[0:26:42-0:26:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:42):**  Is that a trend you're seeing?  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:44):**  Well, certainly I've been having conversations in Singapore this week and so they import  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:47):**  90 percent of their food.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:50):**  And especially during covid, like this was a very scary time for them.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:26:53):**  And so the government has started to pump quite a bit of money into looking at eggs,

**[0:27:01-0:27:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:01):**  And they're trying to produce 30 percent of their food in Singapore by 2030 and putting  
**[0:27:08-0:27:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:08):**  lots of systems in place.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:10):**  And it's vertical, like all they can do is vertical.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:13):**  Like they can't go out.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:14):**  You know, they have to go up.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:16):**  And they were one guy.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:19):**  One guy was telling me about they're doing like vertical sheep farming, which I just  
**[0:27:22-0:27:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:22):**  can't imagine.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:23):**  But, you know, there some of them are on the 20th floor.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:28):**  But that's certainly happening in Singapore where they're looking at using different technologies.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:33):**  And I think countries like Brazil are certainly adopting a lot of different technologies and  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:38):**  looking at what else can grow, how can we grow it, how can we do this better?  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:41):**  So it's certainly happening globally.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:44):**  Vani also predicts a shake up in some of the traditional food supply chains.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:49):**  And so when you look at the whole supply chain, starting from that first mile of like leaving  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:27:55):**  the farm gate, getting all the way to retailer food service in the produce industry and like  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:00):**  all, all that needs to happen there.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:03):**  And I don't know if you've seen it, the landscape map on the supply chain that Shana Day and  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:09):**  Britta Rosenheim have done.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:11):**  It's amazing how many different companies are in there.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:14):**  And they really looked at the different verticals.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:16):**  And how do we do supply chain that works?  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:19):**  You know, that really goes all the way from the farmer to the retailer and what kind of  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:22):**  systems need to be in place.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:23):**  And there's all sorts of systems that, you know, computer vision systems and just the  
**[0:28:30-0:28:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:30):**  traceability that's important.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:32):**  And so I think that's an area that's really under invested in and super important.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:38):**  And especially, I think, since covid really exposed how scary that supply chain is, I  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:42):**  think people are starting to look at it differently.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:46):**  And I was talking to a company the other day, Swarm Engineering, and it's a bunch of guys  
**[0:28:49-0:28:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:49):**  from Microsoft.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:51):**  And they're really looking at how do we do the logistics system all the way through and  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:28:56):**  figure out how to save money and really support the industry.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:01):**  And so I think that's an area not exactly the area I know the most about, but I think  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:08):**  it's a really important area for food to really understand, you know, how can we do things  
**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:12):**  there?  
**[0:29:13-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:13):**  There's so much going on in the field.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:14):**  And a lot of the, and I know you guys work in this area a lot, a lot of the robotics  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:19):**  and the automation and artificial intelligence and then what's happening in the field.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:23):**  And I was talking to a company the other day about this and I almost had this feeling of,  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:29):**  oh, yeah, this.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:31):**  And it's so ridiculous that I'm thinking that this is just like old hat, you know, because  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:35):**  it's amazing.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:36):**  You know, it's amazing what they're doing.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:37):**  And I think it's, you know, the adoption on that is going to be slower.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:41):**  I think it may be faster in some ways in produce because the farms are smaller and the information  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:46):**  is more valuable.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:48):**  But it is amazing what's happening, like being able to know exactly when to pick and knowing  
**[0:29:52-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:52):**  exactly which apple flowers to reduce so that you have a better crop and really using AI  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:29:58):**  to be able to see almost every plant and make a decision on, you know, how to treat that.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:03):**  So it's pretty amazing.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:05):**  We're actually seeing that connect to the supply chain point you made before where when  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:09):**  you have more information about what's happening in the field, what does that mean for how  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:12):**  you can re-engineer the supply chain?  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:14):**  Do you need as much cold chain infrastructure or do you need different kinds of logistics  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:18):**  support when you know basically ahead of time what you're going to pick or when it's going  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:22):**  to be ready or what you're going to do in the field that's going to be highly responsive  
**[0:30:27-0:30:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:27):**  to what consumers want and on demand?  
**[0:30:29-0:30:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:29):**  Does that actually change how supply chains look and work?  
**[0:30:32-0:30:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:32):**  And to your point before, who creates and captures value?  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:35):**  That's an area we're really excited about.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:38):**  And so how do you look when you look at that whole what you just said, that whole piece,  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:42):**  I mean, how do you look at interoperability?  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:44):**  Like how do you talk to people about that and how that's, I think, one of the biggest  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:48):**  issues.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:49):**  It's like you've got 20 dashboards and all those different pieces of data.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:30:53):**  And so I guess just all industries go through a process of maturing and that fitting together.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:00):**  But have you seen anyone that's trying to kind of crack that?  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:03):**  Not, I mean, we've seen people trying to crack it both from like a we'll build dashboards  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:07):**  and we'll be a kind of power BI or whether they're ag tech specific or not, kind of aggregate  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:12):**  data and give you your view of it, which I think is interesting, probably hard to get  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:15):**  to venture scale, but useful tools that we see growers really, really appreciating right  
**[0:31:19-0:31:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:19):**  now.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:20):**  There's I think a play around some kind of open source approach to creating the standards  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:26):**  and helping build the pipes in this space.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:28):**  The challenge is there's a lot of initiatives doing that open ag data initiative and different  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:32):**  industry specific initiatives to say, here's how we talk about vine rows or here's how  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:36):**  we talk about rod acre cropping and what the farm looks like.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:40):**  It really can be a whole of industry approach, but who has the incentive to do that?  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:43):**  Who wins?  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:44):**  And that's where we are increasingly thinking about open source.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:47):**  How do you create the harness, the momentum of the community to build those tools, but  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:52):**  you can still have a venture scale business model, which I think you do need and world  
**[0:31:56-0:31:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:56):**  class tech and software talent because it really is a tech play.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:31:59):**  But right now we're in the kind of early stage of industry maturity where everyone's building  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:32:03):**  their own APIs, doing their own work to connect the dots.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:32:07):**  And that just makes it more confusing.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:32:08):**  But over time, I think we'll see more standards and more pipes being built and there are opportunities  
**[0:32:13-0:32:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/20/social-license-and-plant-genetics#t=0:32:13):**  there for sure.

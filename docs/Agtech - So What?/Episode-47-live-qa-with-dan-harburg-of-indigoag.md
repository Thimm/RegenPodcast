### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 11:52:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:00:11):**  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:00:16):**  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:00:21):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:00:26):**  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  
**[0:00:30-0:00:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:00:30):**  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Today's episode is a live recording from the  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:00:48):**  Sydney Ag Tech Meetup, which we run in partnership with SproutX. Big thanks to the team at Grow  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:00:54):**  Love Project, who recorded and produced this episode. My guest is Dan Harburg. Dan is a  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:00:59):**  senior director with Indigo Ag, and Indigo is one of ag tech's biggest startups. They've  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:01:05):**  raised over 650 million, have over 1000 staff, and are working to expand in the US and internationally.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:01:12):**  Dan was visiting Australia to learn more about carbon farming and the work that's happening  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:01:17):**  here that might be helpful to Indigo and farmers around the world. You'll hear my chat with  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:01:21):**  Dan and then the Q&A from audience at the end. We start with Dan telling us how he came  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:01:26):**  to work at Indigo. I come from a technical background. I did a PhD in electrical engineering,  
**[0:01:31-0:01:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:01:31):**  actually, and started exploring opportunities for technology to transform new industries.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:01:38):**  And one of the first companies that I helped start was a robotics company that ended up  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:01:41):**  doing quite a bit of work in the food and agriculture sector, a company called Soft  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:01:45):**  Robotics that's also based in Boston. And in that company, we were developing a brand  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:01:50):**  new way to grip products very delicately. We started getting invited by agricultural  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:01:56):**  producers around the world to come look at production facilities, processing plants,  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:02:00):**  and more and more go into the field and think about how we could automate harvesting operations.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:02:06):**  I got really interested in exploring the food and ag space and seeing all these opportunities  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:02:11):**  for new tech to come to an industry that hasn't seen a lot of the digital transformations  
**[0:02:16-0:02:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:02:16):**  that have happened in other places. And so through that experience and then some time  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:02:19):**  spent working with a venture capital fund, helping them explore how digital technologies  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:02:24):**  could transform this industry. I found Indigo and joined about a year ago. So I've heard  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:02:29):**  that Indigo has gone from something like 300 people 18 months ago to over 1000 now. When  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:02:36):**  did you join? I signed at a point that we were like 350 and they had already grown to  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:02:42):**  almost 500 by the time that I joined, like in between when I signed my offer letter.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:02:47):**  And now we're over 1000 as you said. So it's been amazing to see how quickly the offices  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:02:51):**  have expanded in Boston and in Memphis where really the biggest growth is happening. But  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:02:56):**  now more and more here in Australia as well as South America, we just opened an office  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:03:00):**  in Europe as well. So we have some folks based in Switzerland now too. So how many of you  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:03:05):**  in the audience could say you know what Indigo does? Five, six. Okay, good. So let's...  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:03:10):**  Glad to see Bill's hand up. I really appreciate it. It's great to have Bill in the audience.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:03:14):**  Bill runs the Australian operations for Indigo. So maybe some questions will get thrown to  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:03:18):**  him later just as a heads up. So tell us what Indigo does. And I think that is probably  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:03:23):**  a temporal story. You might have to start out with what you guys started doing and maybe  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:03:27):**  where you're up to now. Sure. So our mission is to help farmers harness nature to sustainably  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:03:33):**  feed the planet. So we started as a company based in Boston, the home of many biotech  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:03:39):**  companies around the world with a simple insight that was inside of every human there is a  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:03:45):**  microbiome inside of your gut that helps you deal with the stresses that you come under  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:03:49):**  every day. And we've known now for the past decade or so that modifying that microbiome  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:03:55):**  and tuning it in the right ways can help improve human health drastically. The same thing is  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:03:59):**  true of plants. So a plant has a series of microbes inside of it as well as the microbes  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:04:04):**  in the soil, but microbes that help it deal with stresses. And so when you go into fields  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:04:08):**  that have experienced significant stresses, you'll often find that some plants will endure  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:04:13):**  while others die. And that can be because of the microbial composition, the community  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:04:19):**  that's inside of those plants. And so Indigo set out on a mission about five years ago  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:04:22):**  to try to explore those microbial populations and see if we could essentially put the good  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:04:28):**  microbes into plants that didn't have them and help a whole population advance so that  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:04:33):**  you could reduce chemistry and other inputs and maximize grower profits in the same way.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:04:38):**  So we started as a company in that direction. We realized as we started selling a microbially  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:04:44):**  treated seed product to growers that it's hard to transition from the seeds that you  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:04:49):**  buy as a grower today. And also the opportunity for differentiating your product and then  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:04:54):**  selling it into the market is extremely unique. And if you can do that in the right way, you  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:04:59):**  can truly shift the profitability of the grower quite drastically. And you might actually  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:05:03):**  be able to start to decommoditize some of these large commodity grain and fiber industries  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:05:09):**  that exist around the world today where if a grower uses 20 percent less nitrogen in  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:05:15):**  their operation, today there's no way for them to get any more credit from that other  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:05:20):**  than it might reduce their input costs. But if a consumer could be extremely interested  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:05:24):**  in that or a buyer of wheat might be very interested in the protein content of grain,  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:05:29):**  that they have very little opportunity to directly interact with the provider of that  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:05:33):**  grain. And so as we started exploring these areas, we realized that there was a huge opportunity  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:05:39):**  on the crop marketing side, not just the production side, but in helping growers deliver these  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:05:44):**  commodity grains directly to people who cared about the way that they grew them. So Indigo  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:05:48):**  has expanded to try to help with crop production, help with agronomy in the field, and then  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:05:54):**  help growers market their grain in new ways.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:05:57):**  And you guys are also involved in the ag tech space now and with the Terraton Initiative,  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:06:01):**  so I want to talk about both of those. But I guess before I do, I want to talk a little  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:06:05):**  bit about Australia and what you guys are doing here in that microbe space. And one  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:06:09):**  of the things we were chatting about before is that Indigo has kind of been doing a few  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:06:12):**  things in Australia with, I would say, mixed results perhaps. And one of the insights is  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:06:17):**  maybe that some of the microbes in the U.S. that have worked there don't work here and  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:06:21):**  that it's quite a different environment here. So I would love for you to tell the Australian  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:06:26):**  audience kind of what's happening here, what has happened, and what are your kind of activities  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:06:31):**  in Australia?  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:06:33):**  Microbes are a challenging product for many reasons. If you think about the core opportunities  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:06:37):**  that we went after as a company as we started to develop microbes, they were for things  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:06:41):**  like drought-stressed regions, nutrient-deficient regions, and so on. But you can imagine there  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:06:46):**  are a ton of environmental factors that influence the performance of a plant and the performance  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:06:51):**  of a microbe in that environment. And so we perform research all over the world and try  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:06:55):**  to select the best microbes and pair them with the best soils and help them succeed  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:07:01):**  in those environments. Sometimes it works really well, other times it's more challenging,  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:07:05):**  but that's one of the reasons we continue to develop new products as we go.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:07:09):**  I think the exciting thing about what we've seen in the U.S. and now as well in Australia  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:07:13):**  is that in addition to the 85,000 or so acres in Australia that we've planted of treated  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:07:18):**  seed, we're now beginning to roll out our marketplace and some of the other initiatives  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:07:23):**  that we have in the U.S. that essentially can support growers, whether they're using  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:07:27):**  our microbes or not, our in-field agronomy, some of the other digital tools and so on.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:07:31):**  So as the company's mission continues to grow, getting these technologies and opportunities  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:07:36):**  to international markets always has a little bit of a delay, of course. And the company's  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:07:40):**  changing so fast right now that we're seeing unique opportunities pop up all over the place.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:07:44):**  But I'm really excited to be here for the first time and kind of see how the work we're  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:07:48):**  doing in Australia is continuing to advance.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:07:50):**  Yeah, I should mention that Dan literally flew in this morning and landed at 7 a.m.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:07:54):**  So we need to give him at least three more beers and see if he stays awake.  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:07:58):**  No idea what time it is.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:07:59):**  It is exciting to see you guys here. I mean, we use Indigo often as an example of a company  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:08:04):**  that embraces, at least from the outside, a lot of the principles of startups around  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:08:09):**  changing business models rapidly, depending on kind of what's working and what's not and  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:08:13):**  what the market needs. And so being able to really pivot in a way that a big company wouldn't  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:08:18):**  be able to do. From your perspective on the inside, how much of that has been kind of  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:08:22):**  the stages of the strategy that was laid out from the beginning versus a let's just figure  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:08:27):**  it out and see what's working and try all the things?  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:08:29):**  I think it's certainly a bit of both. I mean, our founder and our CEO are both incredibly  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:08:35):**  ambitious people who see a future that many of us also still don't see in the same way  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:08:40):**  that they do. But as the company has expanded and realized new opportunities, every time  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:08:45):**  we uncover something, we also find that there's just huge opportunity on the other side of  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:08:50):**  it. So when we launched Marketplace, one of the things that we didn't realize was that  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:08:54):**  in order for growers to be able to market their grain to a unique buyer, it meant that  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:08:59):**  you had to be able to help them store that grain. They had to be able to hold it to the  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:09:03):**  right point in the year when the buyer could accept it. A lot of growers don't have storage  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:09:08):**  capabilities right now on their farms. And so we actually set up a whole business around  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:09:12):**  on-farm storage to try to figure out ways to provide storage to growers that didn't  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:09:17):**  have it. If you can sell your grain two months later, there are huge opportunities for financial  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:09:23):**  gains. Similarly, we developed a trucking and logistics business because for the same  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:09:28):**  reason. We realized there were huge inefficiencies as we started getting into Marketplace around  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:09:33):**  the actual physical delivery of grain between the buyer and the seller. So those are two  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:09:37):**  examples of things where I don't think we realized that those were such opportunities  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:09:41):**  until we got into the business of marketing grain. But many of them I think we're realizing  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:09:47):**  how synergistic these components are. And that's true of some of our new work in carbon  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:09:52):**  and other areas as well.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:09:53):**  Yeah, so I want to jump to that and I'm actually not entirely sure how separate or similar  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:09:58):**  it is with the kind of digital work with Telus Labs and with the kind of ag tech digital  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:10:03):**  space, robotics, etc. that you're doing. So tell us a little bit about your work there.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:10:07):**  And there's some opportunities I think for Australian startups and companies to get involved  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:10:10):**  as well.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:10:11):**  As a company, when I joined, we just recently stood up a part of the organization called  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:10:16):**  Indigo Research Partners. Indigo Research Partners is really set up as what we believe  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:10:21):**  is the world's largest ag tech lab to be able to evaluate new technologies and deploy them  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:10:26):**  and rapidly scale those that work and those that don't. For a lot of ag tech startups,  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:10:31):**  it's really hard to prove the value of your technology to growers and to market proponents.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:10:36):**  You know, if you have a technology that you think might reduce input requirements, like  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:10:41):**  say water, a new irrigation sensor by 20%, often you're stuck as a startup going kind  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:10:47):**  of grower to grower, proving it to one and then proving it to the next. And so much time  
**[0:10:52-0:10:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:10:52):**  is spent with each one of those folks. And the grower is your only kind of way to demonstrate  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:10:58):**  the value. But in the case of Indigo, with these research partner networks and the way  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:11:02):**  we are spread out around the world, we're helping to deploy those kinds of technologies  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:11:06):**  to evaluate their value proposition and then to rapidly scale the ones that work well.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:11:11):**  And so we've done that with a number of startup companies in in-field sensors. You mentioned  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:11:17):**  Telus Labs. We realized as we started to work with them that satellite technology and the  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:11:21):**  ability to evaluate yield and performance from space was going to be a game changer  
**[0:11:26-0:11:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:11:26):**  for us as a company. So we looked at all the different companies that were out there and  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:11:29):**  that ultimately led to our acquisition of Telus Labs. But startups, they play a huge  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:11:35):**  role in our interaction with the space and we're constantly trying to get more of them  
**[0:11:40-0:11:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:11:40):**  into our pipeline.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:11:41):**  Cool. So tell us about the Teratun initiative, which is a pretty big announcement that's  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:11:46):**  made some waves in agriculture. How many of you guys have heard of the Teratun initiative  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:11:50):**  before reading the description of the meetup? Okay, four or five. Okay, great. So give us  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:11:54):**  the kind of the background in the 101.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:11:56):**  The Teratun initiative is something that's been in the works for quite some time at the  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:11:59):**  company. We, since the beginning, had in our mission statement to try to think about how  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:12:03):**  we can help growers improve the sustainability of their practices. And we'd thought for most  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:12:08):**  of our time about that in terms of being able to reduce input requirements to reduce the  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:12:13):**  water use of products and so on. We started to realize though that soil and the opportunity  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:12:19):**  in carbon specifically was massive, but that it required pretty significant change from  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:12:25):**  growers. So if you're a grower today and you modify your practices in certain ways, there  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:12:30):**  are ways for you to significantly reduce your emissions while also potentially increasing  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:12:35):**  the amount of carbon in the soil. And so Indigo's business has, I think, is really well set  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:12:41):**  up to try to help provide that advice to growers for what practices to choose and how to optimize  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:12:46):**  their management strategies. And then also through the crop marketing side of the business  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:12:51):**  to try to help deliver more value to the grower by being able to market the grain that you  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:12:55):**  have as sustainably grown with specific metrics. So we started to explore what are the ways  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:13:01):**  that we could quantify those sustainability gains and then help pay growers. And over  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:13:05):**  time that has now led to us realizing the opportunity in soil carbon and launching the  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:13:11):**  Terraton Initiative, which is a global effort to try to reduce and sequester a trillion  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:13:17):**  tons of carbon dioxide into agricultural soils. That is a massive number of tons. For those  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:13:22):**  that know a thing or two about carbon, all mankind emissions that exist in the atmosphere  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:13:27):**  today that have increased since the Industrial Revolution are about a trillion tons. So our  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:13:32):**  mission here is to say, is there some way that we could actually take the 3.9 billion  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:13:38):**  acres of cropland around the globe and pull all of the CO2 that we have dumped into the  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:13:43):**  atmosphere out of the atmosphere? It has a number of amazing benefits for farmers. If  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:13:48):**  you are able to increase carbon content in your soil, you reduce the resiliency of your  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:13:53):**  crop. You reduce the ability for it to be affected by a number of different diseases  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:13:59):**  and certainly drought, stress and so on. So we think that that kind of an ambitious goal  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:14:05):**  is obviously huge in its scale and it will require collaboration with a ton of different  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:14:10):**  participants around the world to do. It is going to require a deeper understanding of  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:14:14):**  how soil carbon increases, the kinds of management practices that farmers need to take on and  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:14:20):**  then also new markets that pay growers, rewarding them for increasing soil carbon. So one of  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:14:25):**  the reasons I am here in Australia this trip is to go visit the Carbon Farming Conference  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:14:29):**  next week in Albury and learn how you all have been working on this for much longer  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:14:34):**  than we have. We think there is a lot to learn from what is going on around the world.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:14:38):**  I want to ask, what has the response been like from growers because the talk around  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:14:43):**  carbon farming and around that consumers want this and the potential of farmers to farm  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:14:47):**  regeneratively and more sustainably, that is something that has been talked about for  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:14:49):**  a while. But in many cases, it has not been practical or financially viable. So have you  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:14:55):**  guys kind of changed that conversation at all or how is that changing in terms of the  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:14:59):**  response of farmers and what it will actually mean in terms of their bottom line and their  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:15:03):**  farming practices? The interest from growers in the program that we are putting together  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:15:07):**  has been immense. Since the time of the Terraton Initiative launch, which was about a month  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:15:11):**  ago, we have actually had over 3 million acres of growers try to sign up for this program,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:15:17):**  which is more than all of the acres of treated seed that we have delivered across the globe  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:15:21):**  since the start of the company. So it is a pretty crazy number for us to think about  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:15:25):**  trying to help more acres than we have ever been on with these new initiatives. I think  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:15:30):**  growers see this as an opportunity to gain additional revenue on top of what they have  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:15:34):**  already been doing. If we can make it low cost enough for them to participate and make  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:15:39):**  the reward large enough, then it should be a no-brainer for them as well as for the buyers  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:15:43):**  of these credits. So that is our hope. What is the kind of thinking around both the economic  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:15:49):**  viability in terms of sampling and that it has to be there over time and you have to  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:15:53):**  prove that the carbon was sequestered and continues to be sequestered? What is the pathway  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:15:57):**  to actually be able to do that without spending more money than is economically feasible?  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:16:01):**  Tough questions. It is certainly the thing that has caused these markets to break down  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:16:06):**  in the past. It is one thing to say I planted a tree and as long as I don't cut down that  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:16:11):**  tree it will continue to grow carbon in its size and I can easily measure the diameter  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:16:16):**  of the tree and know how much carbon is there. That is a very challenging thing to do in  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:16:21):**  a system that is changing so frequently like agriculture and recognizing as well that a  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:16:27):**  single year of bad weather could potentially wipe out gains from previous or that you could  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:16:32):**  be doing everything right and still not increasing your carbon content. We think there are a  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:16:36):**  lot of technologies that can help us assess what a viable acre looks like versus a nonviable  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:16:42):**  acre. We think recommending the right kinds of practices to growers and really being along  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:16:46):**  the journey with them is a big driver here. And then we think making, just as you said,  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:16:50):**  making the cost of sampling low enough by trying to only sample exactly where you need  
**[0:16:54-0:17:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:16:54):**  to and leveraging models in every point possible essentially to increase your ability to drive  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:17:01):**  costs down. So all those things we think Indigo is uniquely positioned to do but it's a big  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:17:05):**  task ahead of us for sure and it's not something that anybody has really figured out I'd say.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:17:09):**  Yeah definitely and hopefully we'll keep hearing reflections from you after you leave Australia.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:17:13):**  I'd be curious what you learn here and is it kind of as far ahead as you thought it  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:17:17):**  might be and what have you learned. One of the last questions I have before I kind of  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:17:21):**  open it up to the audience is how you see the connection back to consumers and how important  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:17:27):**  is that is this something that will be fully connected to consumers and pulled through  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:17:31):**  like an organic certification that is really that kind of belief system from consumers  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:17:36):**  pulling for and voting for the way they want the food system to be and or more of the kind  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:17:41):**  of carbon market financial instruments focus upstream in that space. Hopefully it's both.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:17:47):**  I mean I would say if a grower is able to gain additional income from a market component  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:17:52):**  here somebody paying them to put carbon into the ground and then they're also able to actually  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:17:56):**  sell a grain that's been produced more sustainably that the consumer is interested in buying.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:18:01):**  The hope is that both of those sort of add up to produce a really viable opportunity  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:18:06):**  for growers. I think it totally changes the game for growers as well. I mean that if you  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:18:12):**  think about for ages growers have been thinking about optimizing around profitability those  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:18:17):**  that those that can think about it but generally the proxy for that has been yield. So if I  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:18:22):**  can improve my yield by X percent then I have the best chance of being profitable in the  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:18:27):**  market and that works well when prices for crops are high of course. I think those that  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:18:32):**  are smarter often think about it more complex. You know what are my input costs and my production  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:18:37):**  levels how do I balance profitability in the right way. If you introduce carbon though  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:18:42):**  to that equation and you say carbon has a price to it then a grower has this whole new  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:18:47):**  lever on which to kind of optimize their operation. It might actually be more viable for you to  
**[0:18:52-0:18:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:18:52):**  have significantly lower yield, plant cover crops, do all kinds of other practices and  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:18:58):**  grow carbon as you're kind of growing a crop and think about those two in tandem which  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:19:02):**  I think is just a really interesting economic opportunity for a grower and one that hasn't  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:19:07):**  been explored. It also means that all the cropping systems and genetics and breeds and  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:19:12):**  varieties of everything we've developed have all been optimized on yield. We've never thought  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:19:18):**  about well what if I increase plant root biomass by X amount and what would that do to the  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:19:24):**  genetic makeup. So there are so many interesting opportunities on that side as well. And that  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:19:28):**  part is so important that the metric has been yield and that other metrics like carbon or  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:19:34):**  other financial incentives are absolutely critical to kind of change the system. My  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:19:39):**  last question and then I'll open it up to the audience is you guys have raised over  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:19:42):**  six hundred fifty million dollars and are arguably kind of one of the few ag tech startups  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:19:48):**  that has built their own channel and on a path to kind of not get acquired but perhaps  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:19:53):**  list or have them other different kind of exit than many of the other ag tech startups.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:19:57):**  What has the response been from incumbents? Is it kind of collaborative in any way? Are  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:20:03):**  you totally a threat? Are there kind of opportunities to partner? What's that dynamic like? I would  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:20:08):**  say we're the only company that's actually trying to kind of master every part of the  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:20:12):**  agricultural system from inputs all the way through marketing. So any of the large incumbents  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:20:18):**  that you talk to they have a siloed view of the world that is just their piece of it.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:20:23):**  So a Cargill, a Bungee and ADM right just crop marketing. So we might be disrupting  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:20:29):**  that part of their business and they might see us as a big threat but they don't think  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:20:34):**  of us as kind of a direct competitor in that sense. A buyer Monsanto or somebody on the  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:20:40):**  input side Syngenta they might see us as a threat but we actually we take our treated  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:20:45):**  seed product and put that treatment on top of their genetics so we're not developing  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:20:51):**  our own or looking for kind of off market products or anything like that. So those are  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:20:55):**  pretty collaborative relationships from that perspective. I think because we're so wide  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:20:59):**  that nobody kind of sees that as a big threat so it's an interesting spot to sit in from  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:21:04):**  that perspective. Farmers Business Network may be one of the only other ones that is  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:21:07):**  also kind of trying to take a wider lens there but also just a very different business in  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:21:12):**  its fundamentals. So we'll see how the carving side develops and see who starts jumping into  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:21:17):**  that space but at the moment it's been kind of a we're racing against ourselves to try  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:21:22):**  to see how quickly we can understand the whole system which is a nice spot to sit but it's  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:21:27):**  a binary experiment from my view. Either we're wildly successful or this is a great time.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:21:33):**  I think we're going to be wildly successful but you know you never know. Awesome. Well  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:21:37):**  I want to open it up to the audience. There's some pretty knowledgeable people that do work  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:21:41):**  deeply in the ag sector here so hopefully we'll get some good questions. Any questions?  
**[0:21:45-0:21:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:21:45):**  Yeah sure we'll start here. In your business model do you purchase land or you just partner  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:21:52):**  with farmers? We don't currently purchase any land. We partner with farmers who either  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:21:57):**  rent or own their land depending upon the setup. I'd say we're starting to take a  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:22:02):**  look at the role of institutional landowners more and more. For one reason in the carbon  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:22:08):**  markets for example the landowners ultimately are the ones that own the rights to the carbon  
**[0:22:13-0:22:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:22:13):**  that is being grown on the land unlike a normal crop that a renter would own. So it's a really  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:22:20):**  interesting dynamic there and if a landowner can actually help incentivize the renters  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:22:25):**  of their land to increase their carbon in some way that could be a really big way for  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:22:29):**  us to get into the market quickly. I don't see us becoming a landowner from that perspective  
**[0:22:34-0:22:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:22:34):**  but we're starting to take a different view of ownership. Hi I'm Kristy. I've got a  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:22:41):**  two fold question. One is I just want to understand better how you actually microbally treat seeds.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:22:46):**  Do you dip it or do you genetically modify it? And then let's say you're planting.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:22:51):**  I want to understand the cycle time to identify success or failure. Like can you fail fast  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:22:57):**  if you plant something in Australia and it's not right for these soils. What's that cadence  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:23:02):**  for data? Our seed treatment process right now is actually a coating. So we take a bare  
**[0:23:08-0:23:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:23:08):**  seed essentially and tumble it with the microbial product. Often that happens before the crop  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:23:16):**  is being planted. It might sit on the shelf for some period of time before it goes into  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:23:21):**  planting. So different geographies we do a slightly different process to try to modify  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:23:26):**  it to how growers receive their seed and so on. So in the US we centralize a lot of our  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:23:32):**  seed treatment and then distribute bagged treated seed product directly to the growers.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:23:36):**  Here the seed treatment happens much more often at the farm itself. There's no genetic  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:23:41):**  modification in that process. So the grower can kind of bring whatever genetics package  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:23:46):**  they want to the table and then we'll put our treatment on top of that. And our treatment  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:23:51):**  does not have any genetic modification in the microbes themselves so that everything  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:23:57):**  is sort of brewed organically from that perspective. The cycle for new product development can  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:24:04):**  be quite rapid for us. We do a lot of work in lab and then in greenhouse and then in  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:24:09):**  small plot trials and then in big field trials and then in commercial operations. So many  
**[0:24:15-0:24:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:24:15):**  of these things can happen quite rapidly and iteratively. Of course the mother nature and  
**[0:24:21-0:24:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:24:21):**  her inherent cycle for a commercial product requires a sort of seasonal approach. And  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:24:29):**  because we're doing a lot of our seed treatments today on the seed before it goes into the  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:24:34):**  ground we don't come back and do another treatment. But there are of course opportunities to explore  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:24:39):**  that as well. You could think of microbes that are put on a foliar application sprayed  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:24:44):**  on the plant after it's been planted. So we're starting to explore those kinds of things  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:24:48):**  as well because we think there could be many opportunities to target the microbe to the  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:24:53):**  event. At the beginning of the season you don't know if there's going to be an outbreak  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:24:57):**  of some disease or what the drought condition is going to be. So that opportunity to kind  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:25:03):**  of treat in the moment I think is a really interesting one.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:25:06):**  Richard Heath. I run the Australian Farm Institute now but I used to be a farmer. So that was  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:25:11):**  I want to expand on that because that was going to be my question. So when I was farming  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:25:16):**  we did everything we could to build active soils. But the biggest problem we had was  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:25:22):**  variability both temporally and spatially. So we'd have paddocks with three or four different  
**[0:25:27-0:25:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:25:27):**  soil types. Every season's different in terms of how those soil types respond. So how quickly  
**[0:25:35-0:25:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:25:35):**  can you respond with a product that addresses the microbial need of the crop for that particular  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:25:42):**  moment in time in that particular part of a paddock?  
**[0:25:44-0:25:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:25:44):**  David  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:25:44):**  Yeah that's a great question. I would say more and more we're starting to think about  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:25:49):**  things as systems. So I would say it's not it's actually not just the microbe but it's  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:25:54):**  it's everything else that you're doing. It's the management practices that you're implementing.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:25:59):**  So all of those things should ultimately be able to adapt as best they can to the individual  
**[0:26:04-0:26:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:26:04):**  environment. Just as you said that a unique soil type a unique variety unique slope of  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:26:10):**  the field in a specific spot might ideally call for a different mix of microbes even  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:26:16):**  in some senses to optimize performance and try to decrease overall variability of yields.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:26:22):**  So you know all of these things I think are our future potentials for a more digital site  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:26:27):**  specific form of agriculture. And we certainly believe in that same future and I would say  
**[0:26:32-0:26:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:26:32):**  that mission of trying to think about how you would optimize each product for the specific  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:26:35):**  site that it's in is certainly in our in our DNA. It requires a lot of other technologies  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:26:41):**  though to also advance. You know right now we have planting units that can modify planting  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:26:46):**  density or planting depth depending upon certain soil conditions. This kind of a future would  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:26:51):**  require that to the kind of the next level. We would need to be able to sense exactly  
**[0:26:55-0:27:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:26:55):**  what's happening at the individual spot and modify microbial mixtures sort of in real  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:27:02):**  time. So I think it's a it's certainly a direction that we'd like to go.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:27:06):**  Hi I'm Harvey Gaynor. I'm interested Dan in your journey from sort of the mechanical area  
**[0:27:12-0:27:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:27:12):**  or soft robotics through biology and into markets and services really. So I'd like to  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:27:19):**  hear a bit about that journey that transition how it's been for you and then how you see  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:27:25):**  we we bring all of that together and is there any one of those areas that has most opportunity  
**[0:27:30-0:27:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:27:30):**  or especially for leverage for the ag industry. I started in a very technical side technical  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:27:37):**  roles as well. I had a first startup that we tried to found that was more in line with  
**[0:27:42-0:27:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:27:42):**  my initial training. I started realizing personally that I was much more interested in the intersection  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:27:49):**  of science and business and trying to communicate kind of between the two communities and try  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:27:54):**  to help direct scientific development so that it could be impactful in a way that sometimes  
**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:27:59):**  it can't because of those communication barriers between sides. For me that that meant as we  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:28:03):**  started to develop this robotics business starting to realize what opportunities that  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:28:07):**  could bring to agriculture and trying to adapt our our technology to meet those needs. There  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:28:13):**  are so many opportunities in agriculture for new technologies to be developed and deployed  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:28:18):**  and a lot of opportunities as well to leverage technologies that have already been deployed  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:28:23):**  in other sectors. For example some of these challenges in soil sampling for carbon markets  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:28:28):**  a ton of money and research that has been poured into the mining industry. I was speaking  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:28:33):**  to Slaw about this a little earlier tonight. You know being able to optimize the way that  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:28:37):**  drill rigs work and sort of where they're pulling product out of the ground and the  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:28:42):**  hydrology and and geology of mapping soils underground and so on has happened in that  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:28:48):**  industry but yet we're still kind of in the dark ages from a the soil sampling industry  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:28:52):**  for agriculture still works the way it did 70 years ago it hasn't changed at all. So  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:28:56):**  I just feel like there are there are immense opportunities that we can attract scientists  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:29:00):**  and technologists from other industries to come and help us solve problems with agriculture.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:29:05):**  That's true across engineering disciplines it's true across financial disciplines and  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:29:10):**  economics and so on. So we're trying to find those folks and help propel that change ourselves.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:29:16):**  One of the things we talk about here in Australia in the ag tech community a lot is the opportunity  
**[0:29:20-0:29:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:29:20):**  for ag tech to attract a lot of new kinds of talent into agriculture and we haven't  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:29:27):**  really had this scale here for that to play out to say oh there's this ag tech company  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:29:31):**  that has hundreds and hundreds of employees and they've come from all these different  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:29:35):**  disciplines. What's the indigo company like do you have mostly people not from agriculture  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:29:40):**  backgrounds is that kind of story playing out? Yeah it's nearly impossible to find an  
**[0:29:44-0:29:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:29:44):**  agriculture person in Boston. So almost everyone is from some other industry before before  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:29:51):**  they've joined the company. Memphis is a little bit of a different story I think that's one  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:29:55):**  of the reasons we opened a commercial office in Memphis is because we can we can attract  
**[0:29:59-0:30:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:29:59):**  the right kind of talent there that helps us helps keep us grounded. I spoke to somebody  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:30:05):**  who was an early employee at Tesla once and they said that on the day that Tesla went  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:30:10):**  public this guy who had spent 20 years in the automotive industry looked around as all  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:30:15):**  these young starry eyed kids were kind of jumping around saying we're going to build  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:30:19):**  cars and he realized no one here has ever built a car. None of these people have ever  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:30:25):**  seen an assembly line for a car. You can question whether Tesla is successful or not but they  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:30:30):**  have transformed the industry and done some really amazing things. You know I think there's  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:30:35):**  huge value in trying to again bring that talent from outside to reframe problems in a new  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:30:40):**  way. I mean you know if you bring a data scientist who has never seen an agricultural field but  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:30:46):**  instead has looked at some completely different industry you bring them to agriculture they  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:30:50):**  just take a totally different lens on it. So we try to pair up backgrounds in different  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:30:54):**  industries. I mean in Boston we're dominated by there's a lot of consultants in Boston  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:30:59):**  we have a lot of those people. Gosh. Tough life they live but but they build really good  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:31:05):**  slides so we leverage that a lot in our company. You know in the biotech industry obviously  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:31:11):**  is incredibly strong in Boston a lot of great talent coming out of schools no one's heard  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:31:16):**  of like Harvard and MIT. And then we're constantly thinking about how do you think about problems  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:31:21):**  in health care for example and the parallels those might have to the data challenges that  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:31:25):**  we have to solve in agriculture. How do you think about the scaling of technologies that  
**[0:31:30-0:31:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:31:30):**  has happened for internet companies and how could you bring that to agriculture. So I  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:31:33):**  think we really benefit from all those perspectives. Thank you. Diane Hockie and I'm actually a  
**[0:31:39-0:31:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:31:39):**  farmer currently trialing some indigo crop on the Liverpool Plains and I'm so excited  
**[0:31:47-0:31:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:31:47):**  by the initiative. I think it's the first time as a farmer we've had interaction with  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:31:57):**  a company that gives us an opportunity to actually end up with a better economic result  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:32:03):**  at the other end and agriculture in Australia is desperate to try and get that better profitability  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:32:10):**  into our businesses. The drought's sort of knocking us about a bit but I just think there's  
**[0:32:15-0:32:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:32:15):**  a wonderful future for indigo in Australia and I support you wholeheartedly and glad  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:32:22):**  to be on board. So thanks Dan for coming out. This last question was not a plug for indigo  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:32:27):**  a hag. She really was an audience member and we ended the night on this comment and positive  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=406370#t=0:32:31):**  note for the future. I hope you enjoyed the episode. Thanks again to Grow Love Project

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by Tenacious Ventures.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:00:06):**  I'm Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:00:07):**  Before we get to our show today, I have a quick but very exciting announcement.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:00:12):**  Here at Tenacious, we are officially hitting go on raising our second fund.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:00:16):**  The more we did in preparing to kick off fundraising, the more we realized how much of venture,  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:00:21):**  especially in AgTech, is kind of a black box, and how interesting and useful it could be  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:00:27):**  to share our experience out in the open and in near real time with all of you.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:00:32):**  So as part of the podcast, over the next several weeks, we'll be sharing our fundraising thoughts,  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:00:37):**  hopes, fears, failures, and successes right as they happen.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:00:42):**  Fundraising out loud is scary, but we have conviction that doing it will be worth it  
**[0:00:47-0:00:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:00:47):**  for us and for the AgTech community.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:00:49):**  So listen out for more info, stories, and updates.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:00:52):**  And in the meantime, you can learn more about Fund2 and our vision for a digitally native  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:00:56):**  and climate resilient food system at the link in the show notes.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:01:00):**  And now, here's today's show.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:01:05):**  When we think about ag, food, and everything in between, we often take a systems approach,  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:01:11):**  recognizing that each part of the value chain is not its own tidy, siloed world, but instead  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:01:16):**  our deeply interconnected spaces.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:01:18):**  The problem is many in the system do not think this way.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:01:22):**  What we've done in recent years is entirely decouple the system.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:01:27):**  So the agricultural system runs almost separately to the food processing system.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:01:35):**  And the food processing system runs almost separately to distribution elements and the  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:01:39):**  like.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:01:40):**  And that's really counterintuitive.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:01:43):**  These things are interlinked.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:01:45):**  It's the interdependencies which matter.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:01:47):**  That's Nigel Hughes, Senior Vice President of Global R&D and Innovation at Kellogg.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:01:52):**  He's been in what he would unwillingly call the big food space for more than three decades,  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:01:57):**  and he's seen quite a bit of industry transformation during the course of his career.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:02:02):**  Nigel's knowledge of the history of the consumer food space informs where he thinks the system  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:02:06):**  is headed and helped drive our conversation about the role of legacy players in what is  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:02:11):**  a shifting food landscape.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:02:14):**  Nigel and I cover a lot of ground here, from the fundamental drivers of the modern food  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:02:18):**  system to how Kellogg thinks about Scope 3 emissions to how Nigel personally communicates  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:02:23):**  about systems thinking.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:02:25):**  But it all started with a bit of history.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:02:28):**  Really there was a fairly standard model for consumer businesses.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:02:34):**  I would probably say from, depending on which part of the world you were in, but 1940s,  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:02:40):**  1950s, regarding the nature and kind of consumer, because you'd got economies around the world  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:02:46):**  which were growing.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:02:47):**  You've got consumer groups through the baby boomers that were growing.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:02:51):**  You then got a route to market for those people that was fairly similar for many years.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:02:57):**  You basically worked through the big retailers, and you essentially, throughout that period,  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:03:04):**  sourced commodities.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:03:05):**  Your ingredient streams were commodities.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:03:08):**  And in the last 10 years, but even more accelerated in the last five years, so many dimensions  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:03:14):**  of that have turned on its head.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:03:16):**  If you look at population and population growth, now in markets that had huge population growth  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:03:21):**  for many years, particularly in North America and Western Europe and the like, we don't  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:03:26):**  have high population growth.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:03:28):**  We have population aging, but we don't have high population growth.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:03:31):**  If you look at the way we reach people, yes, we still have big retailers, of course, but  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:03:38):**  we've now got a landscape that's dotted with hundreds of ways of getting food and getting  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:03:43):**  product to the consumer.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:03:46):**  And that's only increasing.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:03:48):**  E-comm is increasing incredibly.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:03:51):**  The role that we play going direct to our consumers, but also going via away from home  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:03:57):**  channels, the way that people interact with our foods.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:04:00):**  It's not three standard meals a day.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:04:02):**  It's snacking throughout the day, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:04:06):**  And then the third dimension is about the ingredients in the ingredient streams.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:04:12):**  And this becomes a space for massive amounts of innovation.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:04:16):**  It's interesting when you look back on these changes, they probably feel a little bit like  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:04:22):**  incremental changes and shifts that have been happening.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:04:25):**  When you look forward, do you think it will be a sort of step change or a system change  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:04:30):**  or kind of continuing in these incremental trends?  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:04:32):**  Or is there something where you look back 20 years from now and be like, this is so  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:04:36):**  different than it was, this was a full system shift?  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:04:40):**  I believe we're on the cusp of a system change.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:04:42):**  Why do I say that?  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:04:44):**  I say that because the people that we need to feed in the future are across the world  
**[0:04:51-0:04:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:04:51):**  going to be older people that need to really put food at the center of their wellbeing  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:04:58):**  agenda.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:04:59):**  They can't decouple wellbeing and food anymore.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:05:03):**  That would be my first point.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:05:05):**  My second point is the way in which we then tune foods to the needs of those people, both  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:05:13):**  culturally from an access point of view, but also from a wellbeing point of view, I think  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:05:19):**  he's going to become way more sophisticated in the future.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:05:23):**  And then the third and probably the most important piece is we have to find new ways of fueling  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:05:32):**  that whole system through new agricultural approaches that are going to be more positive  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:05:38):**  from a climate change point of view, but also from a biodiversity point of view.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:05:43):**  And again, also from an access point of view.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:05:46):**  I think the confluence of those three things, those three elements perturbing the system  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:05:51):**  so fundamentally, I think we're going to have to see a system change.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:05:56):**  It's so interesting the opportunity to think about food as a system and how these value  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:06:01):**  chains work and how they connect with people and planet.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:06:04):**  And yet consumers are making that decision busy after a day of work, trying to get food  
**[0:06:08-0:06:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:06:08):**  on the table.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:06:09):**  Not a lot of system thinking.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:06:11):**  That's not how decisions get made.

**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:06:37):**  in big food companies or in food companies generally, it's actually becoming a requirement

**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:06:50):**  and this net.

**[0:06:58-0:07:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:06:58):**  because he could see what was around it.

**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:07:01):**  He had a belief that you could deliver well-being through certain kinds of food and certain

**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:07:08):**  But he looked out the window and he saw what was the system that was around it.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:07:11):**  The system was around it was wheat and corn and all that.

**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:07:24):**  What we've done in recent years is entirely decouple the system.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:07:29):**  So the agricultural system runs almost separately to the food processing system and the food  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:07:37):**  processing system runs almost separately to distribution elements and the like.

**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:07:44):**  These things are interlinked.

**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:07:49):**  So it's only about us opening up those conversations, about us learning about the issues and the  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:07:55):**  opportunities that lie in those interdependencies that we're really going to make progress.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:08:01):**  When I think about how procurement incentives have worked and how sustainability programs  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:08:06):**  have worked, you start with here's a region, we can think about this program, we might  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:08:10):**  provide some funding, we've got to think about scaling it up, but it starts small and  
**[0:08:14-0:08:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:08:14):**  moves ideally into more of a system change.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:08:17):**  If I contrast that to like, why don't we as a food company just provide the farming kind  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:08:22):**  of kit in one, here's your inputs, here's your seeds, like completely change the business  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:08:26):**  model to do something different.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:08:27):**  That's maybe a silly example, you're a food company, not a seed company, but do you have  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:08:31):**  those conversations internally about the trade-offs between a small pilot that gets scaled up  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:08:35):**  versus like, how would we re-imagine this system if we were truly solving for this outcome?  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:08:41):**  I think it comes down to what do you define as the scope of the closed system?  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:08:45):**  So rather than talk about food for a moment, I'm going to talk about transportation.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:08:49):**  Many people thought for many years about these highly sophisticated integrated transportation  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:08:55):**  programs, but many of them never got off the blocks because they required huge amounts  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:09:00):**  of capital, they required groups to speak to each other that never spoke to each other,  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:09:05):**  maybe a city, a state, a country level, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:09:09):**  What's interesting in transportation, particularly, there's some beautiful examples in cities  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:09:14):**  today, one of the biggest revolutions in city transportation is the provision of low-cost  
**[0:09:20-0:09:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:09:20):**  bikes.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:09:21):**  Now you don't give the bikes away, otherwise people will just steal them and not give them  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:09:25):**  you back, but you charge a very small amount and you put bikes around the city.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:09:30):**  Suddenly you've removed the consumer barrier because the consumer doesn't need to think  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:09:36):**  about what they're going to do, all they need to do is walk out of their office building  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:09:40):**  and see that there's a bike wrapped down there and if they want to get across the city, they  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:09:44):**  can just get across the city.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:09:45):**  They don't have to use it every day, they can use other forms of transport if it's raining,  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:09:49):**  but it's extraordinarily accessible and you can do that on a manageable level within a  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:09:54):**  city.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:09:55):**  And that to me is extremely interesting because I don't say it's necessarily just geographically  
**[0:10:01-0:10:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:10:01):**  defined but there are ways of aggregating closed systems that become really interesting.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:10:09):**  Another example of an area we're working is on the Cooled Soil Initiative in Australia.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:10:15):**  In Australia on cooled soil, we found as Kellogg that we've got common interest with the Mars

**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:10:29):**  That can be the boundary if you like of the experiment.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:10:33):**  Going to your more extreme example, I was in Dubai earlier in the year and I am blown  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:10:40):**  away by some of the experiments that they're trying to do.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:10:44):**  What's really interesting there is they import 90 to 95% of their food and obviously they  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:10:52):**  don't necessarily have a high level of natural resources but they do have a lot of cash,  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:10:59):**  capital and they have a lot of sun so they're able to grow things.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:11:04):**  And it's really fascinating to me how they are taking on a more fully integrated model.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:11:12):**  How far that will be translatable to other places I'm not sure.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:11:15):**  Yeah, it's interesting to think about the both imposition of constraints there around  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:11:21):**  the quality of soils and conditions that that environment presents but also the loosening  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:11:25):**  of constraints in terms of not a public company that's reporting quarterly and access to capital.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:11:30):**  So you think about what degrees of freedom you actually have to innovate.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:11:35):**  And I also believe they have another massively important degree of freedom which is they're  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:11:39):**  not self-constraining.

**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:14:46):**  I'm imagining someone listening to this going, this guy from big food, it's an incredibly

**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:14:52):**  Talk a big game here, but is there really that much choice and is there really that

**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:15:00):**  without trade-offs around affordability and nutrition and climate impact?

**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:15:06):**  I know that with the ability to touch billions of people's lives comes an incredible responsibility.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:15:12):**  I've already said, I think the advances that have been made in providing safe and nutritionally  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:15:17):**  dense food have been tremendous in recent years.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:15:20):**  Do we always have to keep raising that bar?  
**[0:15:23-0:15:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:15:23):**  Absolutely we do.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:15:24):**  The biggest issue we have now from a nutritional point of view is not undernutrition, although  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:15:29):**  it is still a serious issue in many parts of the world.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:15:32):**  It is actually, if you like, overnutrition and we have to be constantly conscious of  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:15:38):**  that.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:15:39):**  But that takes me back to the system approach.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:15:42):**  That takes me back to having a better understanding of the challenges and the relationships with  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:15:50):**  the farmers, the challenges and the relationships of processing ingredients for us to then make  
**[0:15:56-0:15:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:15:56):**  them into finally form foods.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:15:59):**  I believe that there is an enormous set of opportunities there to be taking more nutritionally  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:16:05):**  dense ingredients to ensure that they are processed in ways which are a minimal process.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:16:11):**  Incidentally, you can't get much more minimal processing than a cornflake.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:16:15):**  We take one flake of corn and pressure cook it and flatten it.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:16:18):**  But that aside, I think there are some myths around processed foods, heavily processed  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:16:23):**  foods.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:16:24):**  It is absolutely a responsibility, working in my kind of role and in my kind of company  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:16:31):**  to be able to tackle that.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:16:33):**  In the end, a system will work if there's value in it for everyone.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:16:37):**  And that means that it has to have value for the consumer.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:16:40):**  It means it has to have value for people who process the food and make the foods like we  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:16:44):**  do.

**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:16:50):**  How do you think about the evolution in the kind of middle infrastructure of the supply  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:16:54):**  chain that might need to take place?  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:16:56):**  We can say we want more cover cropping, but where's the equipment that's going to harvest  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:17:00):**  it?  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:17:01):**  We want you to grow these other grains because they align more with what consumers want.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:17:05):**  But where's the processing infrastructure?  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:17:07):**  And it's going to be commingled.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:17:08):**  And how do we preserve the integrity of what was produced?  
**[0:17:11-0:17:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:17:11):**  Like how do you think about that middle supply chain?  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:17:13):**  There are many new technologies coming through that have the potential to really help us.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:17:17):**  So if I look at Kellogg's climate impact, then the most significant part of our climate  
**[0:17:23-0:17:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:17:23):**  impact, 80%, is from scope three.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:17:26):**  It's from the ingredients and the way that they're grown.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:17:28):**  Pretty true of any major food company, particularly at being a fundamentally plant-based, if you  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:17:34):**  like, food company.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:17:35):**  I sometimes balk at that distinction, but I'll go with it right now.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:17:39):**  So then if you look at that 80%, of that 80%, roughly 50% of that climate impact comes from  
**[0:17:49-0:17:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:17:49):**  fertilizer production.

**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:18:26):**  but you can certainly have a significant impact?

**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:18:49):**  Now I can be accused of a bit of science fiction.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:18:52):**  We don't have all the technology there yet, but we have the potential for that kind of

**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:19:06):**  We've actually invested in a company called Jupiter Ionics, and they make ammonia from

**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:19:19):**  It's still early, but it's starting to come.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:19:21):**  When I think about Kellogg, though, and core strengths of an organization like yours, it's

**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:19:34):**  do with partners?  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:19:35):**  Are you getting into the investment world?  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:19:36):**  Yes, yes, and yes.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:19:39):**  Because all of this is predicated on working with partners.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:19:43):**  What we believe we are best at is identifying opportunities and opportunity spaces and designing  
**[0:19:51-0:19:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:19:51):**  food to rare bear.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:19:52):**  That's what we do.

**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:19:58):**  things we have even very little knowledge.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:20:01):**  If you're going to believe in systems thinking, you've got to operate with an ecosystem approach.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:20:07):**  And then if I look at less than four years, 34 years ago, I entered Unilever.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:20:14):**  There were several thousand R&D scientists all under one roof.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:20:19):**  Actually, there were under three roofs, but they were all pretty much gathered together.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:20:24):**  And Unilever believed at that time that all aspects of innovation were going to come from  
**[0:20:31-0:20:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:20:31):**  inside the company.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:20:32):**  That has thankfully fundamentally shifted over my career.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:20:36):**  And I know now that we as Kellogg are good at some things, very good at some things,  
**[0:20:44-0:20:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:20:44):**  but also that we absolutely will depend on partnerships, relationships that can be with  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:20:51):**  current companies, relationships that can be with startups and the like.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:20:56):**  And that just adds more fun to the whole conversation as far as I'm concerned, because it stops  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:21:02):**  being a conversation about who owns what.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:21:06):**  And it starts being a conversation about how are all of us going to have an impact.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:21:10):**  I would like that to be true.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:21:13):**  I wonder if all of those rooms, everyone sort of saying, how can we grow the pie versus  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:21:17):**  which slices mine?  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:21:19):**  Tell me about some of the trade-offs, partnerships easy to say and hard to do.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:21:23):**  How do you think about the right kind of partners, the areas you want to play?  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:21:27):**  And I guess where are some of the limits as well?  
**[0:21:30-0:21:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:21:30):**  I can't imagine Kellogg's going to be owning and operating farms, although maybe.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:21:33):**  So yeah, some of those limits and some of the types of partnerships you think make more  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:21:37):**  sense.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:21:38):**  Never say never to anything, but highly unlikely that Kellogg would back integrate to own farms.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:21:44):**  Highly unlikely that Kellogg would back integrate to process grains.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:21:48):**  There are people who are better suited to doing that.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:21:50):**  A live example that we have looking at plant protein.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:21:55):**  So investing in startups that are able to produce plant proteins, we invested a number  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:22:00):**  of years ago in MycoTech.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:22:02):**  This is plant protein from fungal base, basically.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:22:06):**  And with that, they have other investments from other parts of the food company.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:22:11):**  We're happy to work with them and sit with them, because what that does is allows us  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:22:15):**  to very early on test the kinds of plant proteins they're producing, see how compatible they  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:22:20):**  are in terms of making great tasting foods that can be accessible, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:22:24):**  What we are also interested in is indirectly supporting programs like irrigation programs  
**[0:22:31-0:22:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:22:31):**  or measurement programs in the farming space, where because of our scale, we can be a key  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:22:38):**  partner in setting up a standardization of measurement.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:22:41):**  That matters.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:22:42):**  It matters a lot because then other people will join such partnerships and you suddenly  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:22:47):**  are able to create value.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:22:49):**  You mentioned plant based before and I sensed some, I don't know, skepticism or hesitant  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:22:53):**  in your voice there, Nigel, around this term plant based.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:22:55):**  How do you think about that term and what does it mean to Kellogg?  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:22:59):**  Straightforward term like that can be a double edged sword.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:23:01):**  So there is a strong argument that Kellogg was one of the first plant based companies.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:23:06):**  That's what W.K.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:23:07):**  Kellogg did 116 some years ago.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:23:10):**  However, in recent years, that's become very clearly a bandwagon for a lot of people who  
**[0:23:17-0:23:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:23:17):**  are designing foods that may not be nutritionally better foods and may not really be providing  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:23:25):**  a direction for the food business, for the agriculture sector that is a better place  
**[0:23:29-0:23:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:23:29):**  to go.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:23:30):**  So I'm always somewhat skeptical about cliches and those beautiful phrases.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:23:37):**  And so the one thing that's important to me.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:23:40):**  Absolutely, we need to eat more diverse plant based diets in the future.

**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:23:49):**  The scientist in me knows that there's plenty of proof of that if we're going to attack

**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:24:04):**  of what plant based is, because this needs to not be the next fad.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:24:10):**  This needs to be the way that when we look back in 50 years time or 30 years time or

**[0:24:23-0:24:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:24:23):**  The parallel I draw, I remember the mid 90s when we had the first dot com bubble and there  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:24:32):**  were some companies that started in that dot com bubble that are still around today.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:24:37):**  And that's one of the biggest companies in the world.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:24:39):**  Amazon's a great example.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:24:40):**  I remember buying my first book from Amazon probably in about 96 97 if my memory serves.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:24:46):**  But there are many companies that aren't there today because they took a very narrow version  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:24:50):**  of what the dot com was going to be.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:24:53):**  And more importantly, what the four ramifications of the Internet were going to be.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:24:57):**  I think we're in a change in the food system and the way that people look at food and the

**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:04):**  I think we're in a change that is of similar proportions to that dot com change.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:09):**  But it wasn't all clear in 1996 97.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:12):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:13):**  I agree with the system change.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:16):**  One thing I wanted to come back to that you said Nigel is around this kind of association  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:19):**  that's getting made nowadays between plant based and health.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:23):**  And one of my favorite products as a kid was I go waffles.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:28):**  I would say plant based but perhaps not the healthiest of product.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:32):**  You could your Pringles pop tarts, fruit loops, arguably plant based, but I wouldn't say the  
**[0:25:37-0:25:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:37):**  nutritional pinnacle.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:39):**  What's your response to that?  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:40):**  I think these things get grouped together and it's potentially dangerous.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:42):**  I go back to what I just said about don't look at plant based as being just one thing.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:46):**  Plant based is also looked at as not being enjoyable.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:48):**  Those foods are all enjoyable.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:50):**  Kellogg is not trying to claim that Pringles are something which is going to transform  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:55):**  your well being other than your mental well being perhaps because you eat Pringles with  
**[0:25:59-0:26:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:25:59):**  friends and their moments of enjoyment.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:01):**  But also, most importantly, Kellogg's has a broad portfolio of foods.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:09):**  And that is the most critical thing.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:10):**  And it's not just about Kellogg's foods either.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:12):**  We firmly support a diverse diet.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:16):**  That's what people have got to be eating.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:18):**  I really like what you said about systems thinking and the systems perspective.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:22):**  That's a lot how we think and believe that change will really come from that broader  
**[0:26:26-0:26:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:26):**  perspective.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:27):**  And yet I know I find myself in a lot of conversations where people just want a more black and white  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:32):**  answer than the kind of nuanced, oh, but yes, we need to change the mid supply chain.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:37):**  And then there's these other incentives.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:38):**  And yeah, it's not as easy when you think about natural systems as just a black and  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:42):**  white answer.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:43):**  Do you have any advice for me on providing a bit more systems thinking and nuanced into  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:48):**  conversations when other people just want a black and white answer?  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:52):**  I think it's a tremendous challenge because we're taught from a very young age, that very  
**[0:26:56-0:26:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:56):**  deterministic approach.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:26:59):**  And it's only in recent years that we're starting to see the world and everything around us  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:27:05):**  from a system perspective.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:27:07):**  When we talk about issues like climate change, suddenly you can't think about that as being  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:27:12):**  point occurrences.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:27:13):**  This is a transformation of the overall system.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:27:16):**  So the way that I like to help people think about it is stop thinking about the entities  
**[0:27:23-0:27:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:27:23):**  and start thinking about the interactions.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:27:26):**  And if you can get people to just say, think about the interactions and look at the natural  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:27:32):**  world, the natural world is a set of interactions.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:27:36):**  The natural world doesn't produce waste because the waste of one process becomes the fuel  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:27:43):**  of another process.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:27:45):**  And so you can start to paint this picture of interdependency.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:27:49):**  You can start to paint more of a map.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:27:52):**  And for me, it's a conversation.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:27:55):**  It's always a conversation for people because you can begin to get people to think like  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:00):**  that.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:01):**  You can begin to move them from structure to processes.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:04):**  You can begin that.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:05):**  And then suddenly you slide back to yes, but yes, but.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:09):**  And that's okay.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:10):**  That's okay because it is a very different way of looking at it.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:15):**  I have to ask Nigel, as we wrap up here, Telleg recently announced that it'll spin off into  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:20):**  three separate companies.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:23):**  How do you think that will impact your work and some of the trends and opportunities we've  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:27):**  talked about today?  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:28):**  I'm very clear that we'll just give greater strategic focus to the different elements  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:32):**  of the work.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:33):**  The reason that we are spinning the three companies is because they have very different  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:39):**  strategic needs.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:40):**  One is a, we call it a plant-based company, but it is essentially about meat replacement.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:46):**  That company is competing in a very different world today than our core North American cereal  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:53):**  business, which is competing in a very different world to our global snacks business.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:28:57):**  And so it's important that we unleash the potential and power of each of those businesses  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:29:02):**  and to do that makes enormous sense that they're able to plot their own strategic paths and  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:29:07):**  therefore we have to spin.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:29:09):**  But if I go back to the core issues facing those businesses, the issues around the ingredients  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:29:14):**  they source, the issues around transforming those ingredients into culturally relevant  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:29:20):**  accessible foods and the issues of wellbeing and nutrition for people going to the future,

**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:29:28):**  Talking to Nigel about innovation and the future of food from the Kellogg perspective  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:29:31):**  left me with a couple solid takeaways and some lingering questions.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:29:35):**  First, I appreciated the three dimensions of change Nigel identified for the food system.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:29:41):**  Changing populations and incomes have been a talking point for ages, but I liked the  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:29:45):**  attention he paid to the idea of aging populations and how this is increasing the focus on food  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:29:50):**  as nutrition, as well as enjoyment.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:29:52):**  I think his ideas around changing markets and diversity of delivery mechanisms was also  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:29:57):**  interesting though I wish he would have said more about the third factor, how Kellogg is  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:30:01):**  thinking about changing ingredients and ingredient streams going forward.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:30:04):**  Next, I was interested to hear Nigel's insider perspective on change within food organizations,  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:30:11):**  especially his assertion that the sector waited too long for consumers to buy into the sustainable  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:30:16):**  food narrative when the risk to organizations was already present.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:30:20):**  As we think about ESG and climate disclosure reporting here at Tenacious, especially when  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:30:25):**  it comes to scope through emissions, as Nigel discussed, we're seeing a growing awareness  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:30:30):**  of this threat and expect to see more companies responding in new ways as the industry moves  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:30:35):**  beyond the idea that sustainability is just a marketing term or a box to tick.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:30:40):**  Finally, I resonated with Nigel's call for a systems-based approach and I liked his tactic  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:30:46):**  of asking people to think about interactions rather than entities.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:30:49):**  I also appreciated his pointing out that the response to such prompting is often yes, but.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:30:55):**  The status quo way of thinking is not systems-based and converting people to thinking that way  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:30:59):**  whether they're customers, lawmakers, business leaders, or investors is no easy task.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:31:05):**  Though Nigel resisted much of my prying to hear about what specific innovations or ideas  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:31:10):**  his R&D team are cooking up, we'll be watching closely to see how Kellogg and their competitors  
**[0:31:15-0:31:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:31:15):**  navigate the challenges ahead that he's identified.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:31:18):**  To bring us full circle here, I think this conversation tied to, for me, why we'll be  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/systems-thinking-and-the-legacy-of-big-food-with-dr-nigel-hughes-kellogg#t=0:31:23):**  talking a bit more about Tenacious and our Fund2 fundraise here on the podcast.

**[0:00:21-0:00:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:00:21):**  are looking at agtech startups as an opportunity. But it's not always obvious what exactly working  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:00:28):**  in an agtech startup will be like or why you'd choose a startup over a big company.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:00:32):**  I thought there were other problems around the world, bigger problems potentially, that  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:00:37):**  people weren't looking at. That's Soroush Pour, who left the world of

**[0:00:47-0:00:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:00:47):**  You'll also hear from Alyssa Welker. It was fun because nothing was figured out.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:00:54):**  We were just writing our job descriptions as we went because nobody knew what would  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:00:57):**  actually work. Alyssa's first job after college had her working  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:01:02):**  for a high-growth venture-backed startup where every day she'd cold call farmers across the

**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:01:12):**  But as I said, this episode isn't just for graduates. Meet Karen Thomas, who had been  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:01:16):**  working as an electrician and manager in large companies before trading it in for the fast-paced

**[0:01:28-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:01:28):**  fast-paced industry, but I wouldn't go back. The beauty of startups, and especially agtech,  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:01:36):**  is that there are roles for people with all sorts of different skills and expertise. And  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:01:41):**  there are opportunities to define completely new roles that don't even exist yet.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:01:45):**  And as you'll hear, working in an agtech startup can be full of challenges and setbacks, but  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:01:50):**  also massive opportunities. Let's dig in with Sarush, who's now head of engineering at Vow,  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:01:56):**  a cellular ag company. Going back to the early days, Sarush left university not really knowing  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:02:02):**  what he wanted to do. I just thought a lot of things were interesting  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:02:05):**  and didn't know what I was doing. But I had a very good friend of mine who was very into  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:02:10):**  startups. He'd been reading about it for a long time and thought it was a really interesting  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:02:15):**  space to get into and even tried a couple himself. And he pretty much dragged me into  
**[0:02:20-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:02:20):**  my first startup internship. There was a serial entrepreneur in Germany, actually. And he  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:02:27):**  said, come work with me this summer, come do this. And I kind of said, okay, I don't  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:02:32):**  really know what I'm doing anyway, so I'll go with you. And it didn't take long, two,  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:02:36):**  three, four weeks into that experience, I knew this was for me. We actually ended up  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:02:41):**  not doing the internship, but starting a company with that serial entrepreneur. And this good  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:02:47):**  friend of mine became my first co-founder. And the ability to kind of just like see a  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:02:52):**  problem, do something about it, put something out there, no matter what walk of life you  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:02:56):**  came from, just to see what stuck and what added value to the world, I was hooked forever  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:01):**  and the rest is history. What was that startup? What was that problem  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:05):**  in that product or startup? So it was an online financial education company  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:11):**  called WealthLift. So it was pretty much, we saw the problem of people at that age of  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:17):**  life, particularly university or a few years afterwards, will get coming into their first  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:21):**  career earnings, but they really know what to do with it. And we kind of saw two main  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:26):**  ways people kind of made mistakes. One was like sticking it in a bank account and doing  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:30):**  nothing with it, which is really not good for the long term, or getting into kind of  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:34):**  snake oil stuff. So we started to write about and build interactive videos and articles  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:39):**  about index investing, like getting into the stock market in a safe and reasonable way,  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:45):**  and trying to contribute that. So that became our first company.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:49):**  How did it go? Pretty well for our first company. I mean,  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:52):**  we made all the mistakes you could possibly make in a company. But we got some engagement.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:56):**  We had about, by the end of it, about 80,000 registered users. And we had revenue coming  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:01):**  in from referrals to stock brokerages. And we eventually, a couple of years later, sold  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:07):**  the company to a European web company that did a lot of these kind of content websites  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:11):**  for people to kind of learn about topics. I would say that's pretty successful in the  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:15):**  startup game. Not as successful as some of your later successes, which we'll talk about,  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:19):**  but definitely an 80,000, you know, it's a pretty good number, especially when you're  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:23):**  talking about ag tech. I think there are probably very few startups that have 80,000 users.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:28):**  So then what happened? You sold that company and went immediately into another?  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:32):**  Yeah. So we did that right in the middle of university. So we took a little bit of time  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:36):**  off university. So I went back and finished. I studied mechanical engineering over in the  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:40):**  States. So I finished that. Did a bunch of kind of startup ideas with my co-founder,  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:46):**  that same co-founder and another good friend of mine. Some of them stuck, some of them  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:49):**  had some successes, but we ultimately realized, Hey, you know what? We don't really know what  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:55):**  we want to do, what problems we want to solve. We didn't know why these problems were deeply  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:00):**  important because we were trying to kind of come up with them on a whiteboard out of the  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:04):**  blue. So I was like, if I want to understand problems that actual people are having that  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:09):**  actually hurt, I need to go out there and just be in the world, you know, talk to customers,  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:14):**  talk to individuals. So I went over to San Francisco and joined a company called Plaid,  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:20):**  which became my next stage of my career.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:24):**  Plaid is a FinTech startup that builds software to connect people with their bank accounts.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:28):**  It has been pretty successful. In 2020, Visa announced plans to acquire Plaid for over  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:33):**  $5 billion.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:35):**  Plaid was a really great company that was up and coming. So at this point it was about  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:41):**  10, 11 people. I had a couple of both the founder and an early employee I was good friends  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:46):**  with and I could see they were doing something really special and that it was a place I could  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:50):**  learn a lot. And that's really what drew me to them.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:53):**  Yeah, it's interesting that we talk a lot in AgTech about like, you need to understand  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:57):**  the problems and the users. And it's so interesting, especially for someone coming out of uni that  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:06:00):**  maybe doesn't have as much life experience to have felt all those problems, or especially  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:06:05):**  if you want to go into a new industry that you didn't grow up in, like you actually don't  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:06:08):**  know where the issues are. And so all you could do is focus on the technology.

**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:06:23):**  Do you have any example of any stupid things that you built that turned out not to work  
**[0:06:26-0:06:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:06:26):**  or like ideas that you had that you thought were good?  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:06:29):**  There were so many, I don't even know which ones were worth looking at. I mean, some of  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:06:33):**  them like we just didn't maybe go deep enough and they actually did turn out to some of  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:06:38):**  them be real things. We just didn't understand it. So we looked at, for example, on robotics  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:06:44):**  integrators, we spoke with a bunch of robotics integrators and had this idea, for example,  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:06:49):**  like could you take different robotic devices and abstract away some of the differences  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:06:55):**  there and deal with that? But as soon as we realized the very long purchase cycles for  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:00):**  some of those things, we walked away. Not immediately walked away, but we kind of got  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:04):**  discouraged. So there weren't even necessarily bad ideas as we didn't have that conviction  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:09):**  to follow through and get to a good result.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:12):**  Right. So tell me a little bit about the Plaid journey from just a couple of people to what  
**[0:07:16-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:16):**  it ended up being.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:17):**  Yeah. So I joined as an early software engineer. I was a very young team. Most people were  
**[0:07:22-0:07:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:22):**  in their twenties or thirties and Plaid had found some really interesting problems. Like  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:29):**  they found out that essentially banks were not super easy to work with as external vendors.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:34):**  If you were trying to build a budgeting tool or a retirement planning tool or any of these  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:39):**  things, the banks weren't very willing to handle that data. So Plaid was essentially  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:42):**  finding ways to get to that data in ways that the customer wanted to be able to do without  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:48):**  the bank's permission necessarily. So it was this wild ride where we were trying to use  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:54):**  mobile apps and web apps and whatever else to get access to that data. And then at the  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:00):**  same time, our own systems were kind of falling over all the time. So it became this game  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:05):**  of let's get to the data and then let's make sure our infrastructure actually works. And  
**[0:08:09-0:08:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:09):**  over time it went from this very like hacky, just make it work, glue operation to actually  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:16):**  we're turning into a real piece of banking infrastructure, financial infrastructure that  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:22):**  people rely on.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:23):**  So why you decided to leave and come back to Australia? Tell us a little bit about that  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:27):**  and ultimately ending up in food and ag.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:30):**  Yeah, there was a few pieces to that. I guess the first was I thought financial infrastructure,  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:35):**  banking infrastructure, that's all important, but there's plenty of smart people already  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:40):**  getting into those fields for a host of reasons. I thought there were other problems around  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:45):**  the world, bigger problems potentially that people weren't looking at. So I wanted to  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:49):**  kind of dig into those. And when I left Plaid, I still didn't know what those things would  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:52):**  be, but I had a sense that there was something else out there for me. On a personal level,  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:58):**  I was, you know, the stage of a company that I love the most is that founding moment that  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:09:03):**  those early years, which are so hard and so risky, but also so necessary. There's no company  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:09:09):**  that gets a hundred plus employees without going through that zero to a hundred. And  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:09:13):**  so that was really exciting for me and something I want to get back to. And then finally, as  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:09:18):**  far as like the States and Australia went, I, you know, I was in the Bay area, I was  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:09:23):**  in San Francisco for Plaid. And I think the Bay area is a very special place. It really  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:09:28):**  is a Mecca for technology, but I was quite convinced that there were other places around  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:09:34):**  the world that you could do really amazing things. And if you were the kind of individual  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:09:39):**  that wanted to start one of these things, you also needed to be kind of rooted in a  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:09:43):**  place for a while to be really successful. And for me, I thought quality of life, lots  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:09:49):**  of natural advantages to Australia, Australia and Sydney in particular were the right place  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:09:54):**  for me. So I made my way back here so that I could get started on that same journey.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:09:59):**  Tell me about that. Why, why Sydney? Why Australia?  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:10:02):**  Yeah, I think the States is a funny place. I mean, it has huge advantages in many ways.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:10:07):**  One of the biggest is just the size of the common market is massive, but it's also, for  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:10:13):**  anybody who's been there, who's also lived in Australia, it's a little bit of a wild  
**[0:10:17-0:10:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:10:17):**  West in terms of things like cooperation between public and private. It's way worse than it  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:10:24):**  is here in Australia. When you look at ability to enforce laws, also much worse, you know,  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:10:30):**  all of these things. And I was quite convinced that if you could leverage some of Australia's  
**[0:10:35-0:10:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:10:35):**  benefits, things like having a highly educated, highly trusted workforce, instead of institutions  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:10:43):**  where you could actually collaborate between public and private and, you know, then reach  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:10:48):**  out into the rest of the world to get to access to bigger markets that you could actually  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:10:52):**  build some really, really special businesses here. And I'd seen companies like Atlassian  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:10:57):**  and Canva prove that, you know, who had found something really special, been dedicated to  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:02):**  the local ecosystem and tapped into a massive workforce and a massive set of resources to  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:06):**  expand to the rest of the world. And I was convinced that you could do that again and  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:10):**  again. And there were some disadvantages to places like the Bay Area around cost of living,  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:16):**  around access to immigration visas, access to talent that were holding it back from,  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:22):**  you know, producing some of these businesses. So I thought Australia was a better place  
**[0:11:25-0:11:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:25):**  for me overall.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:27):**  And food and ag, did that come with, when you started thinking about impact and other  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:31):**  ways to use your, your skill set and experience, was that top of mind or were there other things  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:36):**  on that list?  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:38):**  It was, it was pretty quick. So it wasn't top of mind when I walked out, cause I really  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:41):**  didn't know too much about lots of industries beyond what I'd worked in, but it was only  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:46):**  a few months after I left Plaid that I really started to get caught onto the, to the food  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:52):**  and ag ecosystem. I looked at a few areas that I found either just personally interesting  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:57):**  or something changed, it was changing in the world or that there was a critical need. And  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:12:02):**  I talked to a few people about the food system and that really sparked a lot of thoughts  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:12:07):**  in my mind. So for one, simply the scale of the food system as the, essentially the world's  
**[0:12:13-0:12:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:12:13):**  largest user of land, water, in many cases, greenhouse gas emissions, the scale of impact  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:12:20):**  on our culture, around human cultures, around the world, all of these things showed me just

**[0:12:30-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:12:30):**  well, you know, challenges around food security, around health, around environmental, kind  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:12:36):**  of taking care of our environment that weren't fully addressed, or at least were in the early  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:12:41):**  stages of starting to be addressed. So I kind of connected those dots and said, actually,  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:12:46):**  if you can really figure out a couple of big problems here, you could have a really, really  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:12:50):**  big impact.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:12:51):**  Soroush knew from his experience in other startups that to understand the problems growers  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:12:56):**  and people along the supply chain were facing, he'd need some hands-on experience. And as  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:13:01):**  you're probably already aware, getting to the heart of the big problems in ag is not  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:13:05):**  easy. It's super complex, which Soroush also found out.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:13:10):**  No human can actually figure out all this stuff, right? So I would try and learn something  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:13:15):**  and delve into it and then write about it, either personally, privately, or publicly,  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:13:20):**  and follow those. And then things like the air table. So essentially like a table of  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:13:25):**  here are the problems and here's how they connect and here's how their group was. My  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:13:30):**  attempt to kind of wrangle that complexity, like wrangle that into something I could understand.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:13:36):**  But over time, like as I started to kind of build this stuff out, I also realized like,  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:13:40):**  I've got to be concrete, like something, I've got to put something down, right? Something,  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:13:44):**  take an act on something. One of the first things I did was actually just work on farms.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:13:49):**  So I went over to New Zealand for a few months and just worked on farms and just worked with  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:13:55):**  farmers. So I helped take care of dairy cows down in the Southeast in North cargo and also  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:02):**  pick fruit and veg, just kind of talking to people and seeing it up close. So this was  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:07):**  all kind of like part of my hands on journey. And then I started to write down specific  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:12):**  problems I saw. I was like, oh, that piece of machinery, like doesn't talk to the other  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:16):**  piece of machinery so that farmer can't like figure out, you know, the answers to the question  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:21):**  that he's been trying to figure out, or he's got this really complicated way of figuring  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:24):**  it out. So I started kind of writing these down. And then as I was getting to the end  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:29):**  of that discovery period, I just started trying them out being like, okay, let's turn this  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:34):**  into like a mini product, pork to a farmer. Let's turn this into a food product and see  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:39):**  if a supermarket will be interested. So I started taking those concepts and kind of  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:42):**  just playing around with them with actual customers.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:45):**  Did you find that the ag industry and I guess the food industry too was pretty receptive  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:50):**  to you going on that journey and going through that process, especially as a quote unquote  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:54):**  outsider from the industry?  
**[0:14:56-0:15:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:56):**  Yeah, it's interesting. I think the overall answer is yes. I think two groups of people  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:04):**  like stay in my mind. One were like farmers and people in the ag world. And then the other  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:10):**  group of people are people who are more academically minded, so people in the kind of university  
**[0:15:15-0:15:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:15):**  and research world. And I found personally that the ag world was quite open and quite  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:23):**  willing to talk to me and quite willing. As soon as they knew I wasn't selling anything,  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:27):**  at least I worked there very willing. The academic world was less impressed and sometimes  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:33):**  I had to kind of get through a couple of like, why are you here and where's your PhD kind  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:37):**  of conversations. But overall, that was my impression of the ag world was pretty open.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:41):**  As long as I wasn't selling anything, the academic world, I had to jump through a few  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:45):**  more hoops before they would take me seriously.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:48):**  With so many ag tech related opportunities to choose from, Soroush eventually settled  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:53):**  on alternative proteins and joined the team at Vow. But why was he drawn to protein as  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:57):**  a global sustainability issue?  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:59):**  The kind of the 20,000 foot view is that I kind of looked at the food system and I said,  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:16:05):**  the part that seems that it needs the most work for this thing to be around in 20, 30,  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:16:10):**  40, 50 years and for us to still be able to enjoy it is animal agriculture. It's the most  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:16:16):**  resource intensive part of the system. And with 7 billion people on the planet, soon  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:16:21):**  to be 10 billion, we couldn't do it the same ways and expect good results or the same results.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:16:27):**  So that's the area that kind of sucked me in. And I looked at all the different alternatives  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:16:31):**  in that world from plant-based to cellular agriculture to others as well as, you know,  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:16:37):**  algal proteins and then refinements to the way we do animal agriculture as well. And  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:16:41):**  I actually thought multiple of them were actually quite promising. It's not just one that's  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:16:45):**  going to sweep the world and fix it all. I don't think that's true. But then I actually  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:16:50):**  started looking at specific concepts, specific product concepts to play around with there.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:16:55):**  Found Vow in that process. I can tell you a little bit more about it, but the long and  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:16:59):**  short of it is I thought what they were doing was smart and I wanted to automate a lot of  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:17:04):**  the work that they did in the lab and in their R&D work. Started a little consulting shop  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:17:09):**  around that and ended up saying, actually, you know what, we'll get further, faster and  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:17:15):**  better and have more impact if we join forces. And that's why I joined Vow.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:17:20):**  Tell me a little bit about what Vow does and why you picked them.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:17:24):**  So Vow is a cultured meat company. So what that means is we're creating meat without  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:17:30):**  having to raise an animal. So you take a small biopsy, you take a small snippet of muscle  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:17:36):**  tissue from an animal without hurting it permanently. And then you can grow that up. So in culture  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:17:42):**  at small scale, that looks like something you do in a lab in like a flask. At larger  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:17:46):**  scale, it looks more like a fermentation tank. So something like you grew up in yeast for  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:17:51):**  for yogurt or beer. So that's what, that's the kind of the fundamental technology. Vow  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:17:57):**  specifically is looking at it differently to a lot of companies around the world. So  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:18:00):**  most companies around the world are saying, oh, we can take this and just make beef, you  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:18:05):**  know, but without raising an animal. And what we're saying is actually you can take this  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:18:10):**  technology and do so much more with this, like so much more that consumers will care  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:18:15):**  about and give them a lot more choice in the process. So what we're thinking about is can  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:18:20):**  we build a cell library, like a library of these biopsies, these cells from animals,  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:18:25):**  from all around the world, from all different animals, from all different cuts of meat,  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:18:28):**  and grow up and create brand new culinary experiences, brand new sensory experiences  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:18:33):**  that you've never seen before, that you've never gotten to enjoy before. The one that

**[0:19:44-0:19:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:19:44):**  organic, corn and soybeans are bad. And my view of agriculture and food world was just

**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:19:57):**  What do I believe? And it totally shaped ever since then, the past 10 plus years. So I,  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:20:03):**  studied environmental science with a focus on food and agriculture, as well as had a

**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:20:13):**  environmental and social perspectives. Did a lot of work on understanding smaller scale

**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:20:31):**  Yeah, it's such an interesting journey. My journey was a little bit similar in just going  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:20:35):**  from like, big ag is evil to like, no big ag is part of a huge part of the solution  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:20:40):**  and not evil at all. And there's a reason we got here and just a whole different journey.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:20:44):**  How would you sum up your perspective on that nowadays? Like, I'm sure it's still evolving.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:20:48):**  But what would your what would your hot take be now?  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:20:50):**  Yeah, I would say it's totally evolving every day. I think that it has to be somewhere in  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:20:55):**  the middle from my perspective, we can't take, okay, it all has to be small scale organic,  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:00):**  we would need, we would need so many more farmers to do that, you know, my grandparents  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:06):**  were the first ones, the generation that chose to leave the farm, and I've had so many conversations  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:11):**  with my grandma about making that decision. And so I also look at it of like, okay, if  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:15):**  I want this utopian vision of we're all going to go back to the land, that means that we  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:20):**  lose our choices and what we do as well. So from that perspective, I look at it as like,  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:25):**  we need large scale agriculture, we need small scale agriculture, but I also think that we  
**[0:21:30-0:21:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:30):**  need to be meeting in the middle, I think that there's a lot of technologies from large  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:33):**  scale ag that can be used to help make kind of smaller scale systems more efficient, as  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:38):**  well as I do think that big ag system and larger scale agriculture has a lot of changing  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:45):**  that needs to happen. So I don't think that big ag is evil. I do think that there's a  
**[0:21:50-0:21:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:50):**  lot of positive change that can be made by kind of combining principles from small scale  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:57):**  and large scale together.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:59):**  It's this passion for change and a desire to avoid the big bureaucracies and red tape  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:22:04):**  of large companies that's led Alyssa into the world of ag tech startups.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:22:09):**  So I come from my family. So my dad has worked at some of the large agriculture corporations.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:22:16):**  Monsanto is headquartered in St. Louis, so kind of like have that lens of like was interested  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:22:21):**  in agriculture. My mom is also a serial entrepreneur. And coming out of school, I was like, I can't  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:22:27):**  envision myself going and working for several thousand person company, as well as I'm like  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:22:32):**  not super jazzed about going and working for kind of one of the big ag companies.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:22:37):**  But I also knew there was no way I was going to learn what the actual agriculture system  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:22:41):**  looked like in the US and what the landscape looked like without being inside some company  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:22:47):**  to some degree and kind of expanding my horizons that way. And so I actually joined Farmers  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:22:53):**  Business Network, FBN.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:22:56):**  Farmers Business Network is probably one of the most famous ag tech startups. They're  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:22:59):**  an online marketplace, among other things, and have raised over five hundred and fifty  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:23:03):**  million dollars to date. But Alyssa joined in the early days of FBN, which, as she explains,  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:23:09):**  had its benefits and its drawbacks.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:23:12):**  Like the day that they posted, they were just starting their inside sales team in Sioux  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:23:16):**  Falls, South Dakota. So I was the first hire for that position and moved from Philadelphia  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:23:21):**  to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, right out of undergrad, which was an experience.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:23:25):**  How big was FBN when you joined?  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:23:28):**  I was employee number 60. And I think when I left four years later, they were at over  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:23:35):**  400. And I'm actually not sure what they're at now. So it was three years, just like crazy,  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:23:41):**  totally crazy growth and a really awesome experience.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:23:44):**  Yeah, that is, I would say, like classically what we would call a high growth startup.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:23:50):**  Tell me a little bit about your roles there and what that journey was like.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:23:54):**  Yeah, it was a really, really cool time to get on board. I was like this just graduated  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:24:01):**  school as well as they were like just starting their office. So there really wasn't yet.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:24:05):**  The office is brand new. There's no company culture. We worked off of our desks, our standing  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:24:10):**  desks where I stacked Yeti coolers on top of each other. And so it was like a very cool,  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:24:15):**  super early stage startup. Definitely just like figuring things out as we went.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:24:20):**  You know, I remember, so basically they're building out the model of like, can inside  
**[0:24:25-0:24:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:24:25):**  sales work for agriculture? There's always this like belief that to do sales and agriculture,  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:24:32):**  you have to drive up the driveway and go shake the farmer's hand. And they wanted to see  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:24:38):**  if it was possible to do it differently.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:24:40):**  Do you want to describe what inside sales is?  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:24:43):**  Yeah, so I was cold calling farmers. There were some days I cold called over 100 farmers  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:24:48):**  a day, had zero desire to be in sales in the long run, but knew that it was a really good  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:24:54):**  place to start. So yeah, I had a list of farmers and I would cold call farmers every day and

**[0:25:05-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:25:05):**  business network.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:25:06):**  And so everything from calling and just kind of like saying what it was to actually closing  
**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:25:12):**  the sale. So it was cool. You know, sometimes inside sales just does the beginning of the  
**[0:25:16-0:25:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:25:16):**  pipeline. But I had the opportunity to do it all the way through, which was really cool.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:25:20):**  And it because there was no playbook for what works and what didn't work. It was a really  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:25:25):**  fun time. So like get to write your own rules of what did and didn't work. I think, while  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:25:31):**  I don't know why I'm not in sales now, and I left sales like nine months after I started,  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:25:37):**  it was fun because nothing was figured out. And that, that I've actually loved, I actually  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:25:43):**  haven't ever been in a position where like somebody has been in that position beforehand.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:25:47):**  Like I love, you know, we were just writing our job descriptions as we went because nobody  
**[0:25:51-0:25:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:25:51):**  knew what would actually work.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:25:54):**  Do you remember what you said when you'd call a farmer? Like, like I have cold calling horror  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:00):**  stories just from like wanting someone to come on the podcast or whatever needed to  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:04):**  call about an investment we're looking at. But do you remember what you'd say when you'd  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:07):**  call?  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:08):**  We had, well, it's been on the time of year, obviously, farming is such a seasonal business,  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:13):**  like sometimes it'd be like, you know, Hi, my name is Alyssa. I'm with farmers business  
**[0:26:17-0:26:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:17):**  network calling because there's other farmers in your area that are joining FBN to improve  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:25):**  their corn yields or to determine what seed variety is best on with your soil type. And  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:31):**  then always ending with a question. So you know, it was that classic, like figuring out  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:35):**  what worked in sales, as well as figuring out what worked with farmers in that specific  
**[0:26:39-0:26:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:39):**  area. You know, I was calling everywhere from North Dakota farmers, Missouri, you know,  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:46):**  you'd get the occasional East Coast farmer, like just all over the place. And so it was  
**[0:26:51-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:51):**  like, figuring out what messaging works where and when and, and who and I like I spoke Spanish  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:58):**  to one farmer because he picked up and he didn't speak English. I was like, well, you  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:02):**  know, here we go. Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:06):**  What do you mean for maybe someone listening who doesn't think about playbooks or has experience  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:12):**  in sales or startups? Like what's an example of kind of building the playbooks or writing  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:16):**  your job description while it was happening?  
**[0:27:19-0:27:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:19):**  Yeah, to me, it is incredibly fun and incredibly unknown from the sense of when I was interviewing  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:27):**  for the position, like so many things that were said in the interview weren't actually  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:31):**  true to the job, but only because nobody really knew. But it's, it's fun because you get to  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:36):**  basically take the skills that you do have, and what you do know how to do and like, bring  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:40):**  your own spin on it.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:42):**  What's an example of that with the job description? Like what what's is there an example of something  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:45):**  you like thought would be true? And then you're like, Oh, this like doesn't exist yet?  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:48):**  Well, yeah. So like, you know, I was like, Oh, you're gonna have to make, you're gonna  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:52):**  have to have like five good phone calls a day. I didn't know I was gonna have to call  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:56):**  100 farmers to get to those five good phone calls in my head, I was gonna be on the phone  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:00):**  like much less than like robo calling 100 farmers. Part of that is sometimes they're  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:05):**  working off of like lead lists and, and different things where numbers aren't valid, whatever  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:10):**  it may be. And so, you know, I think part of it is just like going with the flow and  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:15):**  figuring out what works it even, you know, for example, a lot of sales organizations,  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:19):**  once they're established, it's like, this is how many times you call somebody, this  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:23):**  is the email you send, this is what the demo looks like. And because none of that was created,  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:29):**  it was so fun to get to build that. So it's like, well, I don't know what email works  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:34):**  best. So I'm gonna like, you know, I ended up being the person that wrote the templates  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:37):**  for everybody. And I started a webinar series for FBA and then kind of had the chance to  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:43):**  like do so many things that at a larger company or even an established position, I would have  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:48):**  never had the opportunity to do because they knew what worked already. Whereas in those  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:52):**  early days, because nobody knew what worked, we were sitting in on each other's phone calls  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:57):**  and figuring out what worked. And it was such a kind of like all over the place collaborative  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:29:02):**  environment, which was a lot of fun.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:29:06):**  Another thing that's different about working in a startup is just how rapidly you can rise  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:29:09):**  through the ranks if the company is successful in its growth. But in such a fast paced, rapidly  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:29:14):**  changing environment, it's also possible to get lost in the sea of changes.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:29:19):**  So I joined in May of 2016. And I, about like two, three months later, I was like a peer,  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:29:33):**  peer manager. So I was like helping to manage a team of folks, other inside sales reps that  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:29:39):**  were kind of in the same position as myself. And then nine months later, I moved into a  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:29:44):**  new business line that I've been starting on specialty crop marketing, and kind of running  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:29:49):**  operations for that. And then I moved into kind of customer success, customer growth  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:29:53):**  role. And so I think one of the things that I learned is like, when something is growing  
**[0:29:58-0:30:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:29:58):**  that fast, there's, there's both infinite possibilities, but there's also, you have  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:05):**  to carve out a space for yourself that works. Because I feel like especially as a young  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:09):**  person coming in, you become this person that wears a ton of different hats. And it's very  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:14):**  easy to get lost in the shuffle. And then all of a sudden, you don't have any expertise  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:18):**  in one specific thing. Companies are hiring folks with expertise for that thing. And it's  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:23):**  hard to kind of carve out that space for yourself.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:27):**  That's so true. I think in the early days, startups need generalists. And so they need  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:31):**  like people that can just do anything. And then as they grow, they need more specialists.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:35):**  And so what's the role for generalists? Like go find another startup, or you've carved  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:38):**  out an expertise in having done those general things and, you know, grown one particular  
**[0:30:43-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:43):**  area and develop that expertise.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:44):**  Yeah. Yeah. And ultimately at FBN, I didn't find that. I wasn't able to find kind of like  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:50):**  carving out my role and figuring out what I wanted to do or what I was really good at.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:55):**  But Alyssa did develop a bunch of skills through her time at FBN. In particular, understanding  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:59):**  how to connect with and talk and listen to farmers.

**[0:31:09-0:31:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:31:09):**  this person that knew so many of the farmers, knew how the farmers thought as well as because  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:31:15):**  I had worked in both the Sioux Falls, South Dakota office, as well as the San Francisco,  
**[0:31:19-0:31:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:31:19):**  California, there was also just like a ton of people and like communication and advocating  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:31:27):**  for the sales team back to the California office and the California office helping like  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:31:31):**  the sales team understand like there's some major cultural differences that also came  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:31:35):**  into play. And so it was interesting where I felt like I was adding value near the end  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:31:40):**  of my time at FBN. In some ways, I didn't feel that way because I didn't have my, you  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:31:45):**  know, at that time, FBN had grown to be pretty large and I didn't have like an area where  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:31:49):**  I felt like, oh, this is where I can really grow and see myself growing and building and  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:31:55):**  is ultimately one of the reasons I left.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:31:57):**  Yeah. I think that kind of culture comment is really interesting that it's something  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:01):**  startups focus on a lot. It's like startup culture and like fail fast and blah, blah,  
**[0:32:06-0:32:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:06):**  blah. But in ag tech especially, there's this kind of challenge of like adding value to  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:13):**  farmers and giving them stuff that that will improve the bottom line that is proven that  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:17):**  isn't snake oil with this tension of like grow and sell and iterate and fail fast. And  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:23):**  it sounds like you experienced that both in like the cold calling and in the San Francisco  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:26):**  versus Sioux Falls office. Like talk a little bit about how that played out.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:30):**  Yeah, it's totally different. I think one of the most beneficial things of starting  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:35):**  in the role that I did, you know, cold calling 100 farmers a day was the fact that I learned  
**[0:32:39-0:32:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:39):**  one, I learned how to talk to farmers and to my whole education in the agriculture technology  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:46):**  and in the commodity agriculture space in the US was from talking to farmers. Like,  
**[0:32:51-0:32:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:51):**  I wouldn't pretend that I knew what I was talking about. I would like it on the phone  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:54):**  and be like, you know, I grew up going to the farm, like my grandparents are farmers,  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:58):**  and I could talk the talk, but I would also say, like, tell me more like I had zero idea.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:33:03):**  And I think that starting from the farmer perspective, and starting from like the customer  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:33:09):**  perspective was, was honestly where I feel like I ultimately could add the most value  
**[0:33:14-0:33:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:33:14):**  because so many of the, you know, it's very kind of sales team focused versus versus kind  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:33:22):**  of management. And that's how it is, I think, in a lot of startups where it's like, you  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:33:25):**  have the people on the phones or on the ground. And then you have the people making the strategic  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:33:28):**  decisions. But I think it's so important to have that like communication loop of like,  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:33:34):**  what are farmers actually saying and like, to be able to kind of bridge that gap was  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:33:38):**  a was a really cool experience. And one of the most important things that in roles in  
**[0:33:43-0:33:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:33:43):**  position since then that I take with me of like, I've been in farmer facing roles ever  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:33:47):**  since and think that like building out the customer experience for the end user for the  
**[0:33:52-0:33:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:33:52):**  farmer is incredibly important. And it's, you have to balance farmers being very skeptical  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:33:59):**  of everything because they're being sold to all the time with the kind of like startup  
**[0:34:05-0:34:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:05):**  culture of like, Oh, we have to move really fast and, and being able to be that person  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:08):**  that's trusted to like, hey, let's pump the brakes a little bit. So we do it right and  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:13):**  do right by the farmer. But also knowing how startups work, and being able to meld those  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:19):**  two is definitely something that I really gained from from my time and startups in both  
**[0:34:23-0:34:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:23):**  Silicon Valley and in outside.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:25):**  Yeah, for sure. One of the things that I can imagine listeners thinking as they're hearing  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:30):**  this is like cold calling 100 farmers a day like that totally reinforces my view of ag  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:36):**  tech startups just being these snake oil salesmen that are like sell at all costs, and it's  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:40):**  a half big product, and they're not adding any value. What would your response to that  
**[0:34:45-0:34:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:45):**  be?  
**[0:34:46-0:34:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:46):**  Yeah, I mean, I would say one is it is like a number when you're on a sales team part  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:54):**  of it like no matter what type of sales it is, it is a numbers game. But it was actually  
**[0:34:59-0:35:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:59):**  the number of conversations I would actually have with farmers was much more discussing  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:35:06):**  like problem solutions. Like it wasn't like it was like it was more of an interview than  
**[0:35:10-0:35:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:35:10):**  anything else. Like thinking about this podcast of like, Oh, you get to talk to so many people  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:35:13):**  when you're doing this podcast. For me, it was kind of somewhat similar of, okay, today,  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:35:18):**  I'm calling farmers in North Dakota. I'm just like, asking what's what's happening on their  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:35:23):**  farm, you know, it came by when I was at FBM, there was such a suite of products, everything  
**[0:35:28-0:35:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:35:28):**  from data support to crop marketing to chemical and seed sales that like, not every it's not  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:35:36):**  going to fit for every farmer. But if you like find a specific need that does make sense,  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:35:40):**  then it works. So I think a big part of it is like thinking about sales is having a conversation.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:35:45):**  And thinking about farmers is like not, oh, this is like somebody I'm selling to, but  
**[0:35:49-0:35:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:35:49):**  like, farmers do have a lot of needs. And there are a lot of promising. There's a lot  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:35:55):**  of promise in certain agriculture technology solutions, but they're very skeptical of it  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:00):**  because of there's a lot of ag tech solutions that aren't that that really aren't designed  
**[0:36:05-0:36:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:05):**  to work for farmers. And so I think having the chance to like really treat each conversation  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:11):**  as a conversation and as like, let me find your problem, you know, versus just selling  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:16):**  something made it like much, one much more palatable for me, I didn't want to be that  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:21):**  like snake snake oil salesperson. And to really like made me feel like, oh, like this, this  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:27):**  can actually help this farmer, which I really liked.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:31):**  Melissa makes it sound easy now, but she's had to have some tricky conversations with  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:35):**  farmers across the US, especially when she tells them her background is in environmental  
**[0:36:39-0:36:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:39):**  science and that she's vegetarian.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:43):**  It's like automatic phone down hang up. Like there's there's been farmers like one time  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:47):**  I was on the phone with this farmer. And we had already been talking for, you know, we've  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:52):**  had multiple phone calls, and we were very far along of like, you know, he's really interested  
**[0:36:56-0:36:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:56):**  in purchasing. And I got to talking more about my background. And I told him, you know, I  
**[0:36:59-0:37:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:59):**  studied environmental science. And he said, you know, if you would have told me that three  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:37:03):**  weeks ago, or if you were to tell my brother that, like, I would hang up the phone on you  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:37:08):**  right now. And not every farmer is that way. But I would say there's right now, especially  
**[0:37:13-0:37:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:37:13):**  in the US agriculture system, there's such this push and pull between environmental,

**[0:43:49-0:43:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:43:49):**  so really appealing to me instead of trying to pull rock and tonnes of rock out of the  
**[0:43:57-0:44:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:43:57):**  ground and crush it up for concrete and just that impact on the environment. So what Go

**[0:44:11-0:44:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:11):**  company to work for, essentially.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:14):**  So you heard about the magnet robots and you were hooked.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:18):**  Tell us a little bit about what Go Terra does. Like, I'm sure when you first heard that,  
**[0:44:22-0:44:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:22):**  you were like, wait, we're installing a what for a who? Like, that's not your everyday  
**[0:44:25-0:44:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:25):**  job. What was that like?  
**[0:44:26-0:44:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:26):**  Yeah. So it was just a little side project. And to hear that we were installing light  
**[0:44:31-0:44:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:31):**  and power for robots that managed maggots, I was a bit blown away to start with. I'm  
**[0:44:38-0:44:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:38):**  like, how does this even work? And not being in that side of the industry, we'd never heard  
**[0:44:45-0:44:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:45):**  of Go Terra before. So it was quite surprising to see or hear about how Go Terra manages  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:52):**  food waste using robots and maggots.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:55):**  What was the conversation like to actually think about coming on board? Like, especially  
**[0:45:00-0:45:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:45:00):**  given some of the scale of projects you were working on and the size of companies and the  
**[0:45:04-0:45:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:45:04):**  size of your team, thinking about going to a still relatively early stage startup that's  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:45:10):**  high growth and venture capital backed. And what was the decision like for you to make  
**[0:45:15-0:45:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:45:15):**  that change?  
**[0:45:16-0:45:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:45:16):**  It was really appealing in the sense that like Olympia's got a big drive and very passionate  
**[0:45:24-0:45:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:45:24):**  about what she does in the industry that she works for. And when you're talking to someone  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:45:30):**  that you could potentially be working for that has that much passion, it gives you the  
**[0:45:35-0:45:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:45:35):**  drive to go, this company hasn't just started from nowhere. They've done a lot of background  
**[0:45:43-0:45:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:45:43):**  work to get to this point. And being a startup company, there is those challenges that a  
**[0:45:51-0:45:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:45:51):**  well-established company already has a lot of procedures and policies in place and whatnot,  
**[0:45:57-0:46:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:45:57):**  which sometimes with a startup that's still coming in place.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:46:03):**  Now that's your job, right? Now you've got to build on this.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:46:06):**  That is my job. So it keeps me very busy. So it definitely has its challenges coming  
**[0:46:11-0:46:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:46:11):**  across to a startup company. But what Go Terra is trying to achieve in that space and for  
**[0:46:19-0:46:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:46:19):**  what it's trying to do for the environment, that hard work isn't really of a concern.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:46:26):**  What was it like? Were you surprised by anything or any examples of how different it really  
**[0:46:32-0:46:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:46:32):**  felt once you got into it? Yeah. So the projects run definitely differently  
**[0:46:36-0:46:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:46:36):**  to a major construction where it's still trial and error sometimes with being a startup like  
**[0:46:44-0:46:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:46:44):**  they've got new iterations coming out and where it's trial and error to see what does  
**[0:46:50-0:46:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:46:50):**  or doesn't work, which you have plenty of setbacks. And it's just one thing that you  
**[0:46:56-0:47:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:46:56):**  can't let get you down. It's just, what do we need to do next? Or what do we need to  
**[0:47:01-0:47:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:47:01):**  try next to make this part of the machine or this robot work? So yeah, it was a different  
**[0:47:08-0:47:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:47:08):**  just it's a different speed. Do you find that like, are you kind of well  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:47:13):**  suited to that environment? Like it can be quite hard to, oh, we've got to move fast  
**[0:47:17-0:47:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:47:17):**  and there's all this uncertainty and probably more responsibility of like, oh, if I don't  
**[0:47:22-0:47:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:47:22):**  do this, no one will like, whereas, you know, in a big company, maybe there's other people  
**[0:47:25-0:47:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:47:25):**  that fall back on. What was that? I don't know if you have any examples or what that  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:47:28):**  was like for you, if those things are true. In the mining game that there are always third

**[0:47:54-0:48:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:47:54):**  the same time with like a whole lot of varied skills and experiences. So you try and just  
**[0:48:02-0:48:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:48:02):**  utilize the guys you have on hand. One because of the money is not there. And when you're

**[0:48:36-0:48:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:48:36):**  Go Terra, like when, when do you arrive, when do you leave, what kinds of stuff are you  
**[0:48:42-0:48:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:48:42):**  doing?  
**[0:48:43-0:48:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:48:43):**  So they're definitely, they can be long hours being in a startup. And that's only because  
**[0:48:48-0:48:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:48:48):**  like you do take a lot of ownership trying to get either jobs on the road or things progress  
**[0:48:53-0:49:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:48:53):**  through on an average day, like it's, you know, 10, 12 hours a day, 14 sometimes, but  
**[0:49:02-0:49:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:49:02):**  very fast paced because you're having a lot of traction with new clients or set deadlines.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:49:09):**  So yes, long hours in agtech startups, but that's true of any kind of startup. Soroush,  
**[0:49:14-0:49:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:49:14):**  who's worked in startups in and outside of agtech says that while much is the same, there  
**[0:49:19-0:49:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:49:19):**  are a few key differences with agtech in his experience and with Australia versus the US.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:49:25):**  Couple of key differences. One, as a biotech startup, I'm not surrounded by lots and lots  
**[0:49:31-0:49:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:49:31):**  of software engineers. Science does come from a different culture, more rooted in academia  
**[0:49:37-0:49:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:49:37):**  and credentialing. So that some of that stuff is definitely new to me and not just that,  
**[0:49:42-0:49:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:49:42):**  there's a different way of working in general. And then the other is, I think Australia is  
**[0:49:47-0:49:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:49:47):**  a little bit different from the US. I mean, I think in the US it's taken as a given that  
**[0:49:52-0:49:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:49:52):**  everybody works themselves kind of to the, you know, to their absolute limits for better  
**[0:49:57-0:50:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:49:57):**  or for worse, even sometimes to the detriment or actually often in the detriment of outcomes.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:02):**  Whereas I find that Australians are a little bit more focused on outcomes and working smart  
**[0:50:08-0:50:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:08):**  rather than working hard. And we try and foster kind of a little bit of both, like understanding  
**[0:50:12-0:50:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:12):**  that we have to work hard and work really long to be able to achieve the big things  
**[0:50:16-0:50:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:16):**  that we want to, but still actually being more focused on outcomes and working a little  
**[0:50:20-0:50:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:20):**  smarter than I think we did even at Plaid, I would say.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:24):**  So what time do you start in the morning and finish up at night?  
**[0:50:26-0:50:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:26):**  Well, I don't want to make it seem like this is the team's hours, this is my hours. So  
**[0:50:31-0:50:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:31):**  there's a definitely a distinction. But for me personally, I start at nine in the morning.

**[0:50:42-0:50:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:42):**  And that's honestly just because I love what I do. And I think of the kind of like the  
**[0:50:46-0:50:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:46):**  weekdays as my bow time and the weekends as the rest of my lifetime.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:51):**  So do you really not work on the weekends? You manage to do that?  
**[0:50:54-0:50:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:54):**  Yeah, mostly. I think if I do anything on the weekend, it's only because something,  
**[0:50:58-0:51:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:58):**  you know, I get like a jolt of energy or something or it's legitimately something that only can  
**[0:51:03-0:51:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:51:03):**  be done on the weekends. But it's a pretty rare thing for me.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:51:06):**  Long hours aren't for everyone. And that's worth considering before joining a startup.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:51:10):**  But one of the big benefits is the really strong team culture where everyone's constantly  
**[0:51:15-0:51:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:51:15):**  doing whatever it takes to move the mission forward. That's what Karen likes the most  
**[0:51:19-0:51:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:51:19):**  about being in a startup.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:51:20):**  We've all got the vision of where we want to head. So everyone just gets in and helps  
**[0:51:26-0:51:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:51:26):**  get the job done. And if something goes wrong, everyone stays back and puts in the hard yards  
**[0:51:33-0:51:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:51:33):**  to just keep the company progressing forward where sometimes there's tendencies in multinational  
**[0:51:41-0:51:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:51:41):**  companies or big companies that they sort of lose sight a little bit of sometimes it  
**[0:51:48-0:51:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:51:48):**  feels like they lose sight of the employees in a sense. And you feel like you're just  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:51:55):**  a number to the company where you're there just to get the job done and that's it. And  
**[0:52:00-0:52:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:52:00):**  so that was really appealing with Go Terra. Everyone's involved. Olympia being the CEO,  
**[0:52:07-0:52:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:52:07):**  she's out on the tractor, you know, shoveling waste as well. Yeah, the same just with everyone  
**[0:52:13-0:52:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:52:13):**  else which is an eye-opener when coming from some larger companies where it'd be fairly  
**[0:52:22-0:52:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:52:22):**  wouldn't happen essentially.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:52:24):**  Yeah, it's fairly something. I think it wouldn't happen. Not to mention Go Terra is unique  
**[0:52:29-0:52:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:52:29):**  in that you literally are shoveling waste. Like that's not a metaphorical statement.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:52:34):**  Yeah, literally shoveling waste. Yep. Shoveling waste onto conveyors and going through your  
**[0:52:40-0:52:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:52:40):**  packaging which isn't the most glorious part of the job but everyone does it. So as part  
**[0:52:48-0:52:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:52:48):**  of a team, it doesn't matter what position you're in within Go Terra. Everyone has their  
**[0:52:53-0:52:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:52:53):**  fair crack at shoveling the waste.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:52:57):**  But aside from the shoveling, startups create an opportunity to rapidly learn new skills.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:53:02):**  After Alyssa left FBN, she continued to work in agtech startups with companies like Florissat,  
**[0:53:07-0:53:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:53:07):**  a cloud-based crop analytics company and now Steward, a crowdfunding platform for diversified  
**[0:53:12-0:53:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:53:12):**  farms which has thrown her into the finance industry as much as agriculture.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:53:18):**  So I'm currently at a company called Steward that is a sustainable investment platform  
**[0:53:23-0:53:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:53:23):**  for diversified, virginate farms. So we're primarily focused on anything outside of the  
**[0:53:28-0:53:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:53:28):**  commodity agriculture space primarily because there's funding options for the corn and soybean  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:53:33):**  growers that are out there or other commodity crops. I talk about corn and soybeans because  
**[0:53:37-0:53:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:53:37):**  I'm from Missouri and currently in Michigan. So I talk about Midwest crops. So Steward  
**[0:53:42-0:53:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:53:42):**  is a platform for those farms that don't really have alternative funding options. It's like  
**[0:53:47-0:53:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:53:47):**  the finance world of agriculture which I knew nothing about before joining. And so it's  
**[0:53:51-0:53:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:53:51):**  really cool to learn more about farm financing and the specific challenges that farmers face  
**[0:53:57-0:54:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:53:57):**  with gaining access to capital, particularly these small diversified farms that are doing  
**[0:54:02-0:54:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:54:02):**  something totally different. And even, you know, I'm working with a farmer right now  
**[0:54:07-0:54:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:54:07):**  that is a cattle farmer in Eastern Oregon and he just can't, he wants to grass finish  
**[0:54:15-0:54:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:54:15):**  the whole way through and he can't get a loan from his FSA office because that means holding  
**[0:54:19-0:54:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:54:19):**  onto the cattle for an extra 15 months. So it's even kind of these farms that are doing  
**[0:54:23-0:54:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:54:23):**  anything at the fringes that don't fit into like the model that the FSA or the US kind  
**[0:54:29-0:54:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:54:29):**  of agriculture banking system has built. We take on all those types of projects and so  
**[0:54:35-0:54:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:54:35):**  it's been really cool to learn everything from like micro dairies to learning about  
**[0:54:41-0:54:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:54:41):**  smaller scale production methods like high tunnels and working on the shoulders of the  
**[0:54:45-0:54:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:54:45):**  season, all the way to, you know, this regenerative beef farmer that I'm talking about.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:54:50):**  In addition to learning new skills, Alyssa is putting her farmer-facing sales and listening  
**[0:54:54-0:54:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:54:54):**  skills to work.  
**[0:54:55-0:55:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:54:55):**  So my day to day, I manage kind of the farmer experience. So we're still a very small company.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:55:01):**  I think I was employee number eight or nine. So we're very small, still building it out,  
**[0:55:07-0:55:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:55:07):**  figuring out what works and I'm managing and working on the whole farmer experience side.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:55:12):**  So right now I am working with a lot of farmers, everything from kind of the initial application  
**[0:55:18-0:55:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:55:18):**  all the way to getting their product live. And it's both a, I'm on the phone with farmers,  
**[0:55:22-0:55:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:55:22):**  but also helping our product team think about how can farmers interact with the product  
**[0:55:28-0:55:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:55:28):**  and what will work and everything from phone calls with farmers, emails to working on kind  
**[0:55:35-0:55:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:55:35):**  of bigger strategy.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:55:37):**  How do farmers think and work and how do we, what types of partnerships would work? And  
**[0:55:41-0:55:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:55:41):**  it's really cool because it has a lot of finance folks. Like it's primarily a finance company.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:55:46):**  And so internally we have a lot of these discussions of we have people with finance backgrounds  
**[0:55:52-0:55:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:55:52):**  and there's a couple of us with agriculture backgrounds and figuring out how to meld our  
**[0:55:56-0:56:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:55:56):**  specialties and knowledge to create a product for farmers that really works.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:00):**  But I absolutely love it. It's a really fun team. It's a very mission driven company and  
**[0:56:05-0:56:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:05):**  it's really cool. It's a totally remote work environment. And so learning how to communicate  
**[0:56:12-0:56:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:12):**  on Slack, my manager uses not just on Slack, but like my manager uses video messages. So  
**[0:56:17-0:56:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:17):**  rather than typing out a long memo, he'll just record a five minute video screen share  
**[0:56:22-0:56:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:22):**  or video of himself explaining something. And he is in New Zealand. And so on the completely  
**[0:56:28-0:56:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:28):**  different time zone, it works really well. So it's been cool to figure out the asynchronous  
**[0:56:33-0:56:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:33):**  work lifestyle and really make it work.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:37):**  In many ways, Alyssa is proof that where you start in an industry like ag tech, which for  
**[0:56:41-0:56:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:41):**  Alyssa was cold calling a hundred farmers a day, isn't necessarily where you end up.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:45):**  But before we wrap up this episode, we'll leave you with some final tips from each of  
**[0:56:50-0:56:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:50):**  our guests. Here's Karen.

**[0:56:59-0:57:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:59):**  you sometimes think that you have that sense of job security where in a startup, there's  
**[0:57:07-0:57:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:57:07):**  so many unknowns where not in terms of job security, but just because when you're trying  
**[0:57:13-0:57:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:57:13):**  to design new technology or new products, you just got to have confidence and what you're

**[0:57:48-0:57:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:57:48):**  together, like we all eat three times a day. It's something that everybody can relate to.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:57:53):**  So advice for people looking into get into the ag food tech space is just go on a LinkedIn,  
**[0:57:59-0:58:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:57:59):**  go into networks and actually just like reach out to people because people are so willing  
**[0:58:04-0:58:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:58:04):**  to help. And I think that's probably true across other startups as well. There is ultimately  
**[0:58:10-0:58:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:58:10):**  like a lot of people, if you just ask them what they're doing and treat it as a life

### Agtech - So What?  (2021-01-13)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agthentic Group. I'm Sarah Nolet.  This is the second episode in our two-part AgTech Career series, which we're bringing  to you in collaboration with the Future Farmers Network. I know a lot of people, whether you've  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:00:16):**  just graduated from college or high school or are looking to switch industries mid-career,  are looking at agtech startups as an opportunity. But it's not always obvious what exactly working  in an agtech startup will be like or why you'd choose a startup over a big company.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:00:32):**  I thought there were other problems around the world, bigger problems potentially, that  people weren't looking at. That's Soroush Pour, who left the world of  fintech to take on a more meaningful challenge around food and sustainability in agtech.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:00:47):**  You'll also hear from Alyssa Welker. It was fun because nothing was figured out.  We were just writing our job descriptions as we went because nobody knew what would  actually work. Alyssa's first job after college had her working  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:01:02):**  for a high-growth venture-backed startup where every day she'd cold call farmers across the  Midwest. And Alyssa is a vegetarian, so you'll hear how that went down.  But as I said, this episode isn't just for graduates. Meet Karen Thomas, who had been  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:01:16):**  working as an electrician and manager in large companies before trading it in for the fast-paced  agtech startup world. It can be definitely a busy and a fast-moving,  fast-paced industry, but I wouldn't go back. The beauty of startups, and especially agtech,  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:01:36):**  is that there are roles for people with all sorts of different skills and expertise. And  there are opportunities to define completely new roles that don't even exist yet.  And as you'll hear, working in an agtech startup can be full of challenges and setbacks, but  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:01:50):**  also massive opportunities. Let's dig in with Sarush, who's now head of engineering at Vow,  a cellular ag company. Going back to the early days, Sarush left university not really knowing  what he wanted to do. I just thought a lot of things were interesting  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:02:05):**  and didn't know what I was doing. But I had a very good friend of mine who was very into  startups. He'd been reading about it for a long time and thought it was a really interesting  space to get into and even tried a couple himself. And he pretty much dragged me into  
**[0:02:20-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:02:20):**  my first startup internship. There was a serial entrepreneur in Germany, actually. And he  said, come work with me this summer, come do this. And I kind of said, okay, I don't  really know what I'm doing anyway, so I'll go with you. And it didn't take long, two,  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:02:36):**  three, four weeks into that experience, I knew this was for me. We actually ended up  not doing the internship, but starting a company with that serial entrepreneur. And this good  friend of mine became my first co-founder. And the ability to kind of just like see a  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:02:52):**  problem, do something about it, put something out there, no matter what walk of life you  came from, just to see what stuck and what added value to the world, I was hooked forever  and the rest is history. What was that startup? What was that problem  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:05):**  in that product or startup? So it was an online financial education company  called WealthLift. So it was pretty much, we saw the problem of people at that age of  life, particularly university or a few years afterwards, will get coming into their first  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:21):**  career earnings, but they really know what to do with it. And we kind of saw two main  ways people kind of made mistakes. One was like sticking it in a bank account and doing  nothing with it, which is really not good for the long term, or getting into kind of  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:34):**  snake oil stuff. So we started to write about and build interactive videos and articles  about index investing, like getting into the stock market in a safe and reasonable way,  and trying to contribute that. So that became our first company.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:03:49):**  How did it go? Pretty well for our first company. I mean,  we made all the mistakes you could possibly make in a company. But we got some engagement.  We had about, by the end of it, about 80,000 registered users. And we had revenue coming  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:01):**  in from referrals to stock brokerages. And we eventually, a couple of years later, sold  the company to a European web company that did a lot of these kind of content websites  for people to kind of learn about topics. I would say that's pretty successful in the  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:15):**  startup game. Not as successful as some of your later successes, which we'll talk about,  but definitely an 80,000, you know, it's a pretty good number, especially when you're  talking about ag tech. I think there are probably very few startups that have 80,000 users.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:28):**  So then what happened? You sold that company and went immediately into another?  Yeah. So we did that right in the middle of university. So we took a little bit of time  off university. So I went back and finished. I studied mechanical engineering over in the  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:40):**  States. So I finished that. Did a bunch of kind of startup ideas with my co-founder,  that same co-founder and another good friend of mine. Some of them stuck, some of them  had some successes, but we ultimately realized, Hey, you know what? We don't really know what  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:04:55):**  we want to do, what problems we want to solve. We didn't know why these problems were deeply  important because we were trying to kind of come up with them on a whiteboard out of the  blue. So I was like, if I want to understand problems that actual people are having that  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:09):**  actually hurt, I need to go out there and just be in the world, you know, talk to customers,  talk to individuals. So I went over to San Francisco and joined a company called Plaid,  which became my next stage of my career.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:24):**  Plaid is a FinTech startup that builds software to connect people with their bank accounts.  It has been pretty successful. In 2020, Visa announced plans to acquire Plaid for over  $5 billion.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:35):**  Plaid was a really great company that was up and coming. So at this point it was about  10, 11 people. I had a couple of both the founder and an early employee I was good friends  with and I could see they were doing something really special and that it was a place I could  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:05:50):**  learn a lot. And that's really what drew me to them.  Yeah, it's interesting that we talk a lot in AgTech about like, you need to understand  the problems and the users. And it's so interesting, especially for someone coming out of uni that  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:06:00):**  maybe doesn't have as much life experience to have felt all those problems, or especially  if you want to go into a new industry that you didn't grow up in, like you actually don't  know where the issues are. And so all you could do is focus on the technology.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:06:12):**  Exactly, exactly. Focus on the technology, focus on the fads, and that's not really going  to have you be ahead of the curve and catching problems that are real problems before anybody  else does.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:06:23):**  Do you have any example of any stupid things that you built that turned out not to work  or like ideas that you had that you thought were good?  There were so many, I don't even know which ones were worth looking at. I mean, some of  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:06:33):**  them like we just didn't maybe go deep enough and they actually did turn out to some of  them be real things. We just didn't understand it. So we looked at, for example, on robotics  integrators, we spoke with a bunch of robotics integrators and had this idea, for example,  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:06:49):**  like could you take different robotic devices and abstract away some of the differences  there and deal with that? But as soon as we realized the very long purchase cycles for  some of those things, we walked away. Not immediately walked away, but we kind of got  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:04):**  discouraged. So there weren't even necessarily bad ideas as we didn't have that conviction  to follow through and get to a good result.  Right. So tell me a little bit about the Plaid journey from just a couple of people to what  
**[0:07:16-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:16):**  it ended up being.  Yeah. So I joined as an early software engineer. I was a very young team. Most people were  in their twenties or thirties and Plaid had found some really interesting problems. Like  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:29):**  they found out that essentially banks were not super easy to work with as external vendors.  If you were trying to build a budgeting tool or a retirement planning tool or any of these  things, the banks weren't very willing to handle that data. So Plaid was essentially  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:07:42):**  finding ways to get to that data in ways that the customer wanted to be able to do without  the bank's permission necessarily. So it was this wild ride where we were trying to use  mobile apps and web apps and whatever else to get access to that data. And then at the  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:00):**  same time, our own systems were kind of falling over all the time. So it became this game  of let's get to the data and then let's make sure our infrastructure actually works. And  over time it went from this very like hacky, just make it work, glue operation to actually  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:16):**  we're turning into a real piece of banking infrastructure, financial infrastructure that  people rely on.  So why you decided to leave and come back to Australia? Tell us a little bit about that  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:27):**  and ultimately ending up in food and ag.  Yeah, there was a few pieces to that. I guess the first was I thought financial infrastructure,  banking infrastructure, that's all important, but there's plenty of smart people already  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:40):**  getting into those fields for a host of reasons. I thought there were other problems around  the world, bigger problems potentially that people weren't looking at. So I wanted to  kind of dig into those. And when I left Plaid, I still didn't know what those things would  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:08:52):**  be, but I had a sense that there was something else out there for me. On a personal level,  I was, you know, the stage of a company that I love the most is that founding moment that  those early years, which are so hard and so risky, but also so necessary. There's no company  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:09:09):**  that gets a hundred plus employees without going through that zero to a hundred. And  so that was really exciting for me and something I want to get back to. And then finally, as  far as like the States and Australia went, I, you know, I was in the Bay area, I was  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:09:23):**  in San Francisco for Plaid. And I think the Bay area is a very special place. It really  is a Mecca for technology, but I was quite convinced that there were other places around  the world that you could do really amazing things. And if you were the kind of individual  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:09:39):**  that wanted to start one of these things, you also needed to be kind of rooted in a  place for a while to be really successful. And for me, I thought quality of life, lots  of natural advantages to Australia, Australia and Sydney in particular were the right place  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:09:54):**  for me. So I made my way back here so that I could get started on that same journey.  Tell me about that. Why, why Sydney? Why Australia?  Yeah, I think the States is a funny place. I mean, it has huge advantages in many ways.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:10:07):**  One of the biggest is just the size of the common market is massive, but it's also, for  anybody who's been there, who's also lived in Australia, it's a little bit of a wild  West in terms of things like cooperation between public and private. It's way worse than it  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:10:24):**  is here in Australia. When you look at ability to enforce laws, also much worse, you know,  all of these things. And I was quite convinced that if you could leverage some of Australia's  benefits, things like having a highly educated, highly trusted workforce, instead of institutions  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:10:43):**  where you could actually collaborate between public and private and, you know, then reach  out into the rest of the world to get to access to bigger markets that you could actually  build some really, really special businesses here. And I'd seen companies like Atlassian  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:10:57):**  and Canva prove that, you know, who had found something really special, been dedicated to  the local ecosystem and tapped into a massive workforce and a massive set of resources to  expand to the rest of the world. And I was convinced that you could do that again and  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:10):**  again. And there were some disadvantages to places like the Bay Area around cost of living,  around access to immigration visas, access to talent that were holding it back from,  you know, producing some of these businesses. So I thought Australia was a better place  
**[0:11:25-0:11:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:25):**  for me overall.  And food and ag, did that come with, when you started thinking about impact and other  ways to use your, your skill set and experience, was that top of mind or were there other things  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:36):**  on that list?  It was, it was pretty quick. So it wasn't top of mind when I walked out, cause I really  didn't know too much about lots of industries beyond what I'd worked in, but it was only  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:11:46):**  a few months after I left Plaid that I really started to get caught onto the, to the food  and ag ecosystem. I looked at a few areas that I found either just personally interesting  or something changed, it was changing in the world or that there was a critical need. And  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:12:02):**  I talked to a few people about the food system and that really sparked a lot of thoughts  in my mind. So for one, simply the scale of the food system as the, essentially the world's  largest user of land, water, in many cases, greenhouse gas emissions, the scale of impact  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:12:20):**  on our culture, around human cultures, around the world, all of these things showed me just  how impactful this area could be. And then I saw some challenges on the other side as  well, you know, challenges around food security, around health, around environmental, kind  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:12:36):**  of taking care of our environment that weren't fully addressed, or at least were in the early  stages of starting to be addressed. So I kind of connected those dots and said, actually,  if you can really figure out a couple of big problems here, you could have a really, really  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:12:50):**  big impact.  Soroush knew from his experience in other startups that to understand the problems growers  and people along the supply chain were facing, he'd need some hands-on experience. And as  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:13:01):**  you're probably already aware, getting to the heart of the big problems in ag is not  easy. It's super complex, which Soroush also found out.  No human can actually figure out all this stuff, right? So I would try and learn something  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:13:15):**  and delve into it and then write about it, either personally, privately, or publicly,  and follow those. And then things like the air table. So essentially like a table of  here are the problems and here's how they connect and here's how their group was. My  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:13:30):**  attempt to kind of wrangle that complexity, like wrangle that into something I could understand.  But over time, like as I started to kind of build this stuff out, I also realized like,  I've got to be concrete, like something, I've got to put something down, right? Something,  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:13:44):**  take an act on something. One of the first things I did was actually just work on farms.  So I went over to New Zealand for a few months and just worked on farms and just worked with  farmers. So I helped take care of dairy cows down in the Southeast in North cargo and also  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:02):**  pick fruit and veg, just kind of talking to people and seeing it up close. So this was  all kind of like part of my hands on journey. And then I started to write down specific  problems I saw. I was like, oh, that piece of machinery, like doesn't talk to the other  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:16):**  piece of machinery so that farmer can't like figure out, you know, the answers to the question  that he's been trying to figure out, or he's got this really complicated way of figuring  it out. So I started kind of writing these down. And then as I was getting to the end  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:29):**  of that discovery period, I just started trying them out being like, okay, let's turn this  into like a mini product, pork to a farmer. Let's turn this into a food product and see  if a supermarket will be interested. So I started taking those concepts and kind of  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:42):**  just playing around with them with actual customers.  Did you find that the ag industry and I guess the food industry too was pretty receptive  to you going on that journey and going through that process, especially as a quote unquote  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:14:54):**  outsider from the industry?  Yeah, it's interesting. I think the overall answer is yes. I think two groups of people  like stay in my mind. One were like farmers and people in the ag world. And then the other  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:10):**  group of people are people who are more academically minded, so people in the kind of university  and research world. And I found personally that the ag world was quite open and quite  willing to talk to me and quite willing. As soon as they knew I wasn't selling anything,  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:27):**  at least I worked there very willing. The academic world was less impressed and sometimes  I had to kind of get through a couple of like, why are you here and where's your PhD kind  of conversations. But overall, that was my impression of the ag world was pretty open.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:41):**  As long as I wasn't selling anything, the academic world, I had to jump through a few  more hoops before they would take me seriously.  With so many ag tech related opportunities to choose from, Soroush eventually settled  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:15:53):**  on alternative proteins and joined the team at Vow. But why was he drawn to protein as  a global sustainability issue?  The kind of the 20,000 foot view is that I kind of looked at the food system and I said,  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:16:05):**  the part that seems that it needs the most work for this thing to be around in 20, 30,  40, 50 years and for us to still be able to enjoy it is animal agriculture. It's the most  resource intensive part of the system. And with 7 billion people on the planet, soon  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:16:21):**  to be 10 billion, we couldn't do it the same ways and expect good results or the same results.  So that's the area that kind of sucked me in. And I looked at all the different alternatives  in that world from plant-based to cellular agriculture to others as well as, you know,  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:16:37):**  algal proteins and then refinements to the way we do animal agriculture as well. And  I actually thought multiple of them were actually quite promising. It's not just one that's  going to sweep the world and fix it all. I don't think that's true. But then I actually  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:16:50):**  started looking at specific concepts, specific product concepts to play around with there.  Found Vow in that process. I can tell you a little bit more about it, but the long and  short of it is I thought what they were doing was smart and I wanted to automate a lot of  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:17:04):**  the work that they did in the lab and in their R&D work. Started a little consulting shop  around that and ended up saying, actually, you know what, we'll get further, faster and  better and have more impact if we join forces. And that's why I joined Vow.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:17:20):**  Tell me a little bit about what Vow does and why you picked them.  So Vow is a cultured meat company. So what that means is we're creating meat without  having to raise an animal. So you take a small biopsy, you take a small snippet of muscle  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:17:36):**  tissue from an animal without hurting it permanently. And then you can grow that up. So in culture  at small scale, that looks like something you do in a lab in like a flask. At larger  scale, it looks more like a fermentation tank. So something like you grew up in yeast for  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:17:51):**  for yogurt or beer. So that's what, that's the kind of the fundamental technology. Vow  specifically is looking at it differently to a lot of companies around the world. So  most companies around the world are saying, oh, we can take this and just make beef, you  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:18:05):**  know, but without raising an animal. And what we're saying is actually you can take this  technology and do so much more with this, like so much more that consumers will care  about and give them a lot more choice in the process. So what we're thinking about is can  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:18:20):**  we build a cell library, like a library of these biopsies, these cells from animals,  from all around the world, from all different animals, from all different cuts of meat,  and grow up and create brand new culinary experiences, brand new sensory experiences  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:18:33):**  that you've never seen before, that you've never gotten to enjoy before. The one that  we often talk about, and it captures the imagination, is the Galapagos turtle. So Charles Darwin  went around the world on the HMS Beagle, and he would try food from all around the world,  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:18:49):**  because that's what you do if you're a naturalist in that time period. And he had these like  incredible culinary experiences. And it's fascinating that we could do that again, give  people these incredible culinary experiences without hurting conservation efforts and actually  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:19:04):**  possibly aiding conservation efforts. So that's what Vow is all about. It's about creating  the world's best, most delicious, most sustainable meat through whatever animals we can get access  through this brand new technology that is cultured meat.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:19:19):**  Like Sarush, Alyssa Welker has spent most of her career in startups. She grew up in  the suburbs of St. Louis, Missouri and loved regularly visiting her great-grandparents'  farm. But when she went to college, she remembers basically being taught that big ag is, well,  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:19:32):**  evil.  When I went to school my freshman year of college, I was studying environmental science,  and I had a professor that from day one, it's all big ag is evil, has to be all small scale,  
**[0:19:44-0:19:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:19:44):**  organic, corn and soybeans are bad. And my view of agriculture and food world was just  like blown open. And it was that college freshman year moment of like, what do I actually think?  What do I believe? And it totally shaped ever since then, the past 10 plus years. So I,  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:20:03):**  studied environmental science with a focus on food and agriculture, as well as had a  peace and justice concentration. So very much looked at food and agriculture from both the  environmental and social perspectives. Did a lot of work on understanding smaller scale  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:20:18):**  and regional food systems, but kind of also always had that lens of I'm from the Midwest,  I'm from corn and soybean country and really wanting to understand what big ag also looked  like.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:20:31):**  Yeah, it's such an interesting journey. My journey was a little bit similar in just going  from like, big ag is evil to like, no big ag is part of a huge part of the solution  and not evil at all. And there's a reason we got here and just a whole different journey.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:20:44):**  How would you sum up your perspective on that nowadays? Like, I'm sure it's still evolving.  But what would your what would your hot take be now?  Yeah, I would say it's totally evolving every day. I think that it has to be somewhere in  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:20:55):**  the middle from my perspective, we can't take, okay, it all has to be small scale organic,  we would need, we would need so many more farmers to do that, you know, my grandparents  were the first ones, the generation that chose to leave the farm, and I've had so many conversations  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:11):**  with my grandma about making that decision. And so I also look at it of like, okay, if  I want this utopian vision of we're all going to go back to the land, that means that we  lose our choices and what we do as well. So from that perspective, I look at it as like,  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:25):**  we need large scale agriculture, we need small scale agriculture, but I also think that we  need to be meeting in the middle, I think that there's a lot of technologies from large  scale ag that can be used to help make kind of smaller scale systems more efficient, as  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:38):**  well as I do think that big ag system and larger scale agriculture has a lot of changing  that needs to happen. So I don't think that big ag is evil. I do think that there's a  lot of positive change that can be made by kind of combining principles from small scale  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:21:57):**  and large scale together.  It's this passion for change and a desire to avoid the big bureaucracies and red tape  of large companies that's led Alyssa into the world of ag tech startups.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:22:09):**  So I come from my family. So my dad has worked at some of the large agriculture corporations.  Monsanto is headquartered in St. Louis, so kind of like have that lens of like was interested  in agriculture. My mom is also a serial entrepreneur. And coming out of school, I was like, I can't  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:22:27):**  envision myself going and working for several thousand person company, as well as I'm like  not super jazzed about going and working for kind of one of the big ag companies.  But I also knew there was no way I was going to learn what the actual agriculture system  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:22:41):**  looked like in the US and what the landscape looked like without being inside some company  to some degree and kind of expanding my horizons that way. And so I actually joined Farmers  Business Network, FBN.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:22:56):**  Farmers Business Network is probably one of the most famous ag tech startups. They're  an online marketplace, among other things, and have raised over five hundred and fifty  million dollars to date. But Alyssa joined in the early days of FBN, which, as she explains,  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:23:09):**  had its benefits and its drawbacks.  Like the day that they posted, they were just starting their inside sales team in Sioux  Falls, South Dakota. So I was the first hire for that position and moved from Philadelphia  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:23:21):**  to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, right out of undergrad, which was an experience.  How big was FBN when you joined?  I was employee number 60. And I think when I left four years later, they were at over  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:23:35):**  400. And I'm actually not sure what they're at now. So it was three years, just like crazy,  totally crazy growth and a really awesome experience.  Yeah, that is, I would say, like classically what we would call a high growth startup.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:23:50):**  Tell me a little bit about your roles there and what that journey was like.  Yeah, it was a really, really cool time to get on board. I was like this just graduated  school as well as they were like just starting their office. So there really wasn't yet.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:24:05):**  The office is brand new. There's no company culture. We worked off of our desks, our standing  desks where I stacked Yeti coolers on top of each other. And so it was like a very cool,  super early stage startup. Definitely just like figuring things out as we went.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:24:20):**  You know, I remember, so basically they're building out the model of like, can inside  sales work for agriculture? There's always this like belief that to do sales and agriculture,  you have to drive up the driveway and go shake the farmer's hand. And they wanted to see  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:24:38):**  if it was possible to do it differently.  Do you want to describe what inside sales is?  Yeah, so I was cold calling farmers. There were some days I cold called over 100 farmers  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:24:48):**  a day, had zero desire to be in sales in the long run, but knew that it was a really good  place to start. So yeah, I had a list of farmers and I would cold call farmers every day and  I was doing everything from, you know, at that time, nobody had heard of FBN or a farmer's  
**[0:25:05-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:25:05):**  business network.  And so everything from calling and just kind of like saying what it was to actually closing  the sale. So it was cool. You know, sometimes inside sales just does the beginning of the  
**[0:25:16-0:25:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:25:16):**  pipeline. But I had the opportunity to do it all the way through, which was really cool.  And it because there was no playbook for what works and what didn't work. It was a really  fun time. So like get to write your own rules of what did and didn't work. I think, while  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:25:31):**  I don't know why I'm not in sales now, and I left sales like nine months after I started,  it was fun because nothing was figured out. And that, that I've actually loved, I actually  haven't ever been in a position where like somebody has been in that position beforehand.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:25:47):**  Like I love, you know, we were just writing our job descriptions as we went because nobody  knew what would actually work.  Do you remember what you said when you'd call a farmer? Like, like I have cold calling horror  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:00):**  stories just from like wanting someone to come on the podcast or whatever needed to  call about an investment we're looking at. But do you remember what you'd say when you'd  call?  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:08):**  We had, well, it's been on the time of year, obviously, farming is such a seasonal business,  like sometimes it'd be like, you know, Hi, my name is Alyssa. I'm with farmers business  network calling because there's other farmers in your area that are joining FBN to improve  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:25):**  their corn yields or to determine what seed variety is best on with your soil type. And  then always ending with a question. So you know, it was that classic, like figuring out  what worked in sales, as well as figuring out what worked with farmers in that specific  
**[0:26:39-0:26:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:39):**  area. You know, I was calling everywhere from North Dakota farmers, Missouri, you know,  you'd get the occasional East Coast farmer, like just all over the place. And so it was  like, figuring out what messaging works where and when and, and who and I like I spoke Spanish  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:26:58):**  to one farmer because he picked up and he didn't speak English. I was like, well, you  know, here we go. Yeah, exactly.  What do you mean for maybe someone listening who doesn't think about playbooks or has experience  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:12):**  in sales or startups? Like what's an example of kind of building the playbooks or writing  your job description while it was happening?  Yeah, to me, it is incredibly fun and incredibly unknown from the sense of when I was interviewing  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:27):**  for the position, like so many things that were said in the interview weren't actually  true to the job, but only because nobody really knew. But it's, it's fun because you get to  basically take the skills that you do have, and what you do know how to do and like, bring  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:40):**  your own spin on it.  What's an example of that with the job description? Like what what's is there an example of something  you like thought would be true? And then you're like, Oh, this like doesn't exist yet?  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:27:48):**  Well, yeah. So like, you know, I was like, Oh, you're gonna have to make, you're gonna  have to have like five good phone calls a day. I didn't know I was gonna have to call  100 farmers to get to those five good phone calls in my head, I was gonna be on the phone  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:00):**  like much less than like robo calling 100 farmers. Part of that is sometimes they're  working off of like lead lists and, and different things where numbers aren't valid, whatever  it may be. And so, you know, I think part of it is just like going with the flow and  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:15):**  figuring out what works it even, you know, for example, a lot of sales organizations,  once they're established, it's like, this is how many times you call somebody, this  is the email you send, this is what the demo looks like. And because none of that was created,  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:29):**  it was so fun to get to build that. So it's like, well, I don't know what email works  best. So I'm gonna like, you know, I ended up being the person that wrote the templates  for everybody. And I started a webinar series for FBA and then kind of had the chance to  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:43):**  like do so many things that at a larger company or even an established position, I would have  never had the opportunity to do because they knew what worked already. Whereas in those  early days, because nobody knew what worked, we were sitting in on each other's phone calls  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:28:57):**  and figuring out what worked. And it was such a kind of like all over the place collaborative  environment, which was a lot of fun.  Another thing that's different about working in a startup is just how rapidly you can rise  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:29:09):**  through the ranks if the company is successful in its growth. But in such a fast paced, rapidly  changing environment, it's also possible to get lost in the sea of changes.  So I joined in May of 2016. And I, about like two, three months later, I was like a peer,  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:29:33):**  peer manager. So I was like helping to manage a team of folks, other inside sales reps that  were kind of in the same position as myself. And then nine months later, I moved into a  new business line that I've been starting on specialty crop marketing, and kind of running  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:29:49):**  operations for that. And then I moved into kind of customer success, customer growth  role. And so I think one of the things that I learned is like, when something is growing  that fast, there's, there's both infinite possibilities, but there's also, you have  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:05):**  to carve out a space for yourself that works. Because I feel like especially as a young  person coming in, you become this person that wears a ton of different hats. And it's very  easy to get lost in the shuffle. And then all of a sudden, you don't have any expertise  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:18):**  in one specific thing. Companies are hiring folks with expertise for that thing. And it's  hard to kind of carve out that space for yourself.  That's so true. I think in the early days, startups need generalists. And so they need  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:31):**  like people that can just do anything. And then as they grow, they need more specialists.  And so what's the role for generalists? Like go find another startup, or you've carved  out an expertise in having done those general things and, you know, grown one particular  
**[0:30:43-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:43):**  area and develop that expertise.  Yeah. Yeah. And ultimately at FBN, I didn't find that. I wasn't able to find kind of like  carving out my role and figuring out what I wanted to do or what I was really good at.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:30:55):**  But Alyssa did develop a bunch of skills through her time at FBN. In particular, understanding  how to connect with and talk and listen to farmers.  I mean, I think part of it came from because I joined the company so early on, I just became  
**[0:31:09-0:31:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:31:09):**  this person that knew so many of the farmers, knew how the farmers thought as well as because  I had worked in both the Sioux Falls, South Dakota office, as well as the San Francisco,  California, there was also just like a ton of people and like communication and advocating  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:31:27):**  for the sales team back to the California office and the California office helping like  the sales team understand like there's some major cultural differences that also came  into play. And so it was interesting where I felt like I was adding value near the end  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:31:40):**  of my time at FBN. In some ways, I didn't feel that way because I didn't have my, you  know, at that time, FBN had grown to be pretty large and I didn't have like an area where  I felt like, oh, this is where I can really grow and see myself growing and building and  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:31:55):**  is ultimately one of the reasons I left.  Yeah. I think that kind of culture comment is really interesting that it's something  startups focus on a lot. It's like startup culture and like fail fast and blah, blah,  
**[0:32:06-0:32:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:06):**  blah. But in ag tech especially, there's this kind of challenge of like adding value to  farmers and giving them stuff that that will improve the bottom line that is proven that  isn't snake oil with this tension of like grow and sell and iterate and fail fast. And  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:23):**  it sounds like you experienced that both in like the cold calling and in the San Francisco  versus Sioux Falls office. Like talk a little bit about how that played out.  Yeah, it's totally different. I think one of the most beneficial things of starting  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:35):**  in the role that I did, you know, cold calling 100 farmers a day was the fact that I learned  one, I learned how to talk to farmers and to my whole education in the agriculture technology  and in the commodity agriculture space in the US was from talking to farmers. Like,  
**[0:32:51-0:32:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:32:51):**  I wouldn't pretend that I knew what I was talking about. I would like it on the phone  and be like, you know, I grew up going to the farm, like my grandparents are farmers,  and I could talk the talk, but I would also say, like, tell me more like I had zero idea.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:33:03):**  And I think that starting from the farmer perspective, and starting from like the customer  perspective was, was honestly where I feel like I ultimately could add the most value  because so many of the, you know, it's very kind of sales team focused versus versus kind  
**[0:33:22-0:33:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:33:22):**  of management. And that's how it is, I think, in a lot of startups where it's like, you  have the people on the phones or on the ground. And then you have the people making the strategic  decisions. But I think it's so important to have that like communication loop of like,  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:33:34):**  what are farmers actually saying and like, to be able to kind of bridge that gap was  a was a really cool experience. And one of the most important things that in roles in  position since then that I take with me of like, I've been in farmer facing roles ever  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:33:47):**  since and think that like building out the customer experience for the end user for the  farmer is incredibly important. And it's, you have to balance farmers being very skeptical  of everything because they're being sold to all the time with the kind of like startup  
**[0:34:05-0:34:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:05):**  culture of like, Oh, we have to move really fast and, and being able to be that person  that's trusted to like, hey, let's pump the brakes a little bit. So we do it right and  do right by the farmer. But also knowing how startups work, and being able to meld those  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:19):**  two is definitely something that I really gained from from my time and startups in both  Silicon Valley and in outside.  Yeah, for sure. One of the things that I can imagine listeners thinking as they're hearing  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:30):**  this is like cold calling 100 farmers a day like that totally reinforces my view of ag  tech startups just being these snake oil salesmen that are like sell at all costs, and it's  a half big product, and they're not adding any value. What would your response to that  
**[0:34:45-0:34:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:45):**  be?  Yeah, I mean, I would say one is it is like a number when you're on a sales team part  of it like no matter what type of sales it is, it is a numbers game. But it was actually  
**[0:34:59-0:35:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:34:59):**  the number of conversations I would actually have with farmers was much more discussing  like problem solutions. Like it wasn't like it was like it was more of an interview than  anything else. Like thinking about this podcast of like, Oh, you get to talk to so many people  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:35:13):**  when you're doing this podcast. For me, it was kind of somewhat similar of, okay, today,  I'm calling farmers in North Dakota. I'm just like, asking what's what's happening on their  farm, you know, it came by when I was at FBM, there was such a suite of products, everything  
**[0:35:28-0:35:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:35:28):**  from data support to crop marketing to chemical and seed sales that like, not every it's not  going to fit for every farmer. But if you like find a specific need that does make sense,  then it works. So I think a big part of it is like thinking about sales is having a conversation.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:35:45):**  And thinking about farmers is like not, oh, this is like somebody I'm selling to, but  like, farmers do have a lot of needs. And there are a lot of promising. There's a lot  of promise in certain agriculture technology solutions, but they're very skeptical of it  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:00):**  because of there's a lot of ag tech solutions that aren't that that really aren't designed  to work for farmers. And so I think having the chance to like really treat each conversation  as a conversation and as like, let me find your problem, you know, versus just selling  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:16):**  something made it like much, one much more palatable for me, I didn't want to be that  like snake snake oil salesperson. And to really like made me feel like, oh, like this, this  can actually help this farmer, which I really liked.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:31):**  Melissa makes it sound easy now, but she's had to have some tricky conversations with  farmers across the US, especially when she tells them her background is in environmental  science and that she's vegetarian.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:43):**  It's like automatic phone down hang up. Like there's there's been farmers like one time  I was on the phone with this farmer. And we had already been talking for, you know, we've  had multiple phone calls, and we were very far along of like, you know, he's really interested  
**[0:36:56-0:36:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:36:56):**  in purchasing. And I got to talking more about my background. And I told him, you know, I  studied environmental science. And he said, you know, if you would have told me that three  weeks ago, or if you were to tell my brother that, like, I would hang up the phone on you  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:37:08):**  right now. And not every farmer is that way. But I would say there's right now, especially  in the US agriculture system, there's such this push and pull between environmental,  you know, water rights and kind of farmers feeling this like the scapegoats for climate  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:37:26):**  change, and like agriculture and production. And so it's interesting to have the environmental  science background, as well as I'm a vegetarian, that is not something like I ever tell farmers.  And it's gotten me into some really interesting situations. You know, on the road, ending  
**[0:37:42-0:37:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:37:42):**  up at farms for dinner, and ultimately, though, has led to some really fruitful discussions.  That's awesome. And makes sense. And it is always Yeah, definitely a different experience  when you're on farm. Any any good stories that come from any of those experiences?  
**[0:37:57-0:38:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:37:57):**  Yeah, I mean, I would say one of my favorite, one of my favorite memories, so I was out  in the middle of nowhere, Nebraska, in the middle of winter, we're at this, like just  this small show I learned, I know a crazy amount about yellow field peas, which is like  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:38:12):**  one of the main protein isolates for alternative meat, which is really expanding growing in  western Nebraska as a prominent crop. So I was out there doing just like a very small  event with some farmers in the area. And one of the farmers that was the member asked,  
**[0:38:27-0:38:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:38:27):**  you know, hey, like, do you want to come to dinner? You know, there was, I think, three  other folks from my company that were there. And, you know, slowly one by one, everybody's  like, No, I can't go, I can't go, I can't go. I didn't really have an excuse not to  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:38:37):**  go other than my flight was really early the next morning, I had to drive to Denver, his  farm was in the opposite direction. And he had been talking about having the bore that  his brother got the bore meat from Christmas that his brother got for him for dinner. And  
**[0:38:53-0:38:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:38:53):**  like, like I said, I don't ever tell farmers that I'm a vet, like, it eventually maybe  comes up once I have like established a relationship, but definitely not something that I say like,  Hey, I'm a vegetarian. So anyway, we make it through the day. And all of a sudden, this  
**[0:39:07-0:39:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:39:07):**  farmer comes out with this hand drawn map of how to get to his house. And it's like,  you know, my wife's been cooking all day, here's the phone number, here's the address,  we can't wait to see you and have you guys over and he kind of handed it out. And I found  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:39:19):**  out that none of my other co workers could go and I was like, I cannot not show up to  this dinner. So I get in my rental car, it's the middle of January, Western Nebraska, like  icy roads, just like trying to make it there end up on this like, end up at a dead end  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:39:33):**  the directions, either I didn't follow them great, or he didn't write them out. Great.  So eventually, eventually make it to this farmer's house. And the table was set for  like 12. And I was like, the only person that made it so first of all, I was like, I am  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:39:48):**  so happy that I came. And second of all, it turned into this like, really beautiful two  to three hour discussion about food and family and about like, why they grow food, why they  grow what they do, and why I eat what I eat. And like, you know, they he this farmer had  
**[0:40:07-0:40:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:40:07):**  grown up, he was like now living in the house that he grew up in, and like had only ever  lived like, in the house next door. And like, we're coming from such different places in  the world, but like learning that through just breaking bread and having food, we could  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:40:21):**  have that conversation. And I was like, you know, they like, here's the board that we're  talking about. I was like, you know, I'll try a bite, but actually, I'm a vegetarian.  And it opened up this actually really lovely conversation where I was like, y'all have  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:40:32):**  a bite, but like, these are my reasons for being a vegetarian. And it it turned out to  be a really, really cool discussion where once once the relationship was built enough,  like actual discussions can come from that. And that's what I found kind of across the  
**[0:40:48-0:40:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:40:48):**  board, which which has been really cool.  I absolutely love that story from Melissa, because it's all about bridging the gap, something  we're really passionate about at agtech. So what we see agtech as being a place of unusual  
**[0:41:00-0:41:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:41:00):**  suspects, what I mean is, for ag to continue to thrive, it needs to involve people from  a wide variety of skill sets and backgrounds. And startups are perfect places for this to  happen where designers, engineers, salespeople, scientists, farmers and communicators all  
**[0:41:16-0:41:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:41:16):**  come together to solve big problems. It's where traditional skills can be used in the  most unconventional and impactful ways. Karen Thomas is a perfect example of this. As a  trained electrician, he never expected to work in a startup. And when he joined food  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:41:31):**  waste startup, go Terra, he definitely never expected to learn so much about maggots.  Definitely does. Yeah, it's just turning, putting power on and turning some robots on  to process food waste. Trying to manage insects, health and well being is a totally different  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:41:53):**  side of the plate I've been on before.  Karen is the head of operations at go Terra, an Australian company that builds waste management  infrastructure using biological processes, in some cases, maggots. Their modular systems  
**[0:42:07-0:42:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:42:07):**  run on site. For example, one was recently installed at brand guru, a large high rise  complex in downtown Sydney to manage food waste from the offices and restaurants. This  is a far cry from where Karen began his career working on the electronics for pokey machines  
**[0:42:22-0:42:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:42:22):**  in the Outback town of Alice Springs. Non Aussie listeners, pokey machines are slot  machines.  It was essentially just maintaining and servicing poke machines and just the electrical equipment  
**[0:42:36-0:42:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:42:36):**  within the machines.  Yeah, right. Definitely not something I've ever thought about. The kind of engineering  behind one of those machines probably tends not to be the kind of state of mind you're  
**[0:42:44-0:42:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:42:44):**  in when you're sitting there playing.  Yeah, it's a good way to learn why you don't play poke machines.  What do you mean by that?  
**[0:42:55-0:43:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:42:55):**  It's just how they're set up in the program. They're, you know, casinos aren't wealthy  for giving away money.  Clearly Karen's passion was not in the gaming industry and he soon left to work in mining  
**[0:43:09-0:43:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:43:09):**  and concrete. This was a real eye opener for him in terms of the environmental damage these  industries can cause. And it got him thinking more about sustainability. But Karen says  it was mainly luck and meeting Go Terra's founder, Olympia, that led him to Agtech.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:43:23):**  I was just lucky by a lucky chance. So I started, I got onto a project which was actually for  Go Terra and we were doing a lighting and power, just electrical install for their main  facility here in Canberra. And that's where I met Olympia. And that's where we got talking  
**[0:43:42-0:43:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:43:42):**  about what Go Terra is all about and what their business models were. And it was just  so really appealing to me instead of trying to pull rock and tonnes of rock out of the  ground and crush it up for concrete and just that impact on the environment. So what Go  
**[0:44:04-0:44:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:04):**  Terra stands for and the drive that they have, I just thought, well, this could be a better  company to work for, essentially.  So you heard about the magnet robots and you were hooked.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:17):**  Yeah.  Tell us a little bit about what Go Terra does. Like, I'm sure when you first heard that,  you were like, wait, we're installing a what for a who? Like, that's not your everyday  
**[0:44:25-0:44:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:25):**  job. What was that like?  Yeah. So it was just a little side project. And to hear that we were installing light  and power for robots that managed maggots, I was a bit blown away to start with. I'm  
**[0:44:38-0:44:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:38):**  like, how does this even work? And not being in that side of the industry, we'd never heard  of Go Terra before. So it was quite surprising to see or hear about how Go Terra manages  food waste using robots and maggots.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:44:55):**  What was the conversation like to actually think about coming on board? Like, especially  given some of the scale of projects you were working on and the size of companies and the  size of your team, thinking about going to a still relatively early stage startup that's  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:45:10):**  high growth and venture capital backed. And what was the decision like for you to make  that change?  It was really appealing in the sense that like Olympia's got a big drive and very passionate  
**[0:45:24-0:45:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:45:24):**  about what she does in the industry that she works for. And when you're talking to someone  that you could potentially be working for that has that much passion, it gives you the  drive to go, this company hasn't just started from nowhere. They've done a lot of background  
**[0:45:43-0:45:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:45:43):**  work to get to this point. And being a startup company, there is those challenges that a  well-established company already has a lot of procedures and policies in place and whatnot,  which sometimes with a startup that's still coming in place.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:46:03):**  Now that's your job, right? Now you've got to build on this.  That is my job. So it keeps me very busy. So it definitely has its challenges coming  across to a startup company. But what Go Terra is trying to achieve in that space and for  
**[0:46:19-0:46:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:46:19):**  what it's trying to do for the environment, that hard work isn't really of a concern.  What was it like? Were you surprised by anything or any examples of how different it really  felt once you got into it? Yeah. So the projects run definitely differently  
**[0:46:36-0:46:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:46:36):**  to a major construction where it's still trial and error sometimes with being a startup like  they've got new iterations coming out and where it's trial and error to see what does  or doesn't work, which you have plenty of setbacks. And it's just one thing that you  
**[0:46:56-0:47:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:46:56):**  can't let get you down. It's just, what do we need to do next? Or what do we need to  try next to make this part of the machine or this robot work? So yeah, it was a different  just it's a different speed. Do you find that like, are you kind of well  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:47:13):**  suited to that environment? Like it can be quite hard to, oh, we've got to move fast  and there's all this uncertainty and probably more responsibility of like, oh, if I don't  do this, no one will like, whereas, you know, in a big company, maybe there's other people  
**[0:47:25-0:47:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:47:25):**  that fall back on. What was that? I don't know if you have any examples or what that  was like for you, if those things are true. In the mining game that there are always third  party companies you can and mechanical companies that you can, you know, lie back onto for  
**[0:47:41-0:47:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:47:41):**  different help to install machines or using cranes or whatnot for different parts of installations  where in a startup, you might still have a very small team, but it's a skilled team at  the same time with like a whole lot of varied skills and experiences. So you try and just  
**[0:48:02-0:48:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:48:02):**  utilize the guys you have on hand. One because of the money is not there. And when you're  dealing with, you know, multimillion dollar projects to being in a startup, you got your  set sort of budgets that you're trying to stick within and keep redesigning or reiterating  
**[0:48:24-0:48:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:48:24):**  different parts of the machine or in like the installation to be better off.  What's the kind of day, and if there is such a thing, an average day for yourself at, at  Go Terra, like when, when do you arrive, when do you leave, what kinds of stuff are you  
**[0:48:42-0:48:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:48:42):**  doing?  So they're definitely, they can be long hours being in a startup. And that's only because  like you do take a lot of ownership trying to get either jobs on the road or things progress  
**[0:48:53-0:49:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:48:53):**  through on an average day, like it's, you know, 10, 12 hours a day, 14 sometimes, but  very fast paced because you're having a lot of traction with new clients or set deadlines.  So yes, long hours in agtech startups, but that's true of any kind of startup. Soroush,  
**[0:49:14-0:49:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:49:14):**  who's worked in startups in and outside of agtech says that while much is the same, there  are a few key differences with agtech in his experience and with Australia versus the US.  Couple of key differences. One, as a biotech startup, I'm not surrounded by lots and lots  
**[0:49:31-0:49:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:49:31):**  of software engineers. Science does come from a different culture, more rooted in academia  and credentialing. So that some of that stuff is definitely new to me and not just that,  there's a different way of working in general. And then the other is, I think Australia is  
**[0:49:47-0:49:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:49:47):**  a little bit different from the US. I mean, I think in the US it's taken as a given that  everybody works themselves kind of to the, you know, to their absolute limits for better  or for worse, even sometimes to the detriment or actually often in the detriment of outcomes.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:02):**  Whereas I find that Australians are a little bit more focused on outcomes and working smart  rather than working hard. And we try and foster kind of a little bit of both, like understanding  that we have to work hard and work really long to be able to achieve the big things  
**[0:50:16-0:50:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:16):**  that we want to, but still actually being more focused on outcomes and working a little  smarter than I think we did even at Plaid, I would say.  So what time do you start in the morning and finish up at night?  
**[0:50:26-0:50:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:26):**  Well, I don't want to make it seem like this is the team's hours, this is my hours. So  there's a definitely a distinction. But for me personally, I start at nine in the morning.  Some days I will actually fix it, finish at six, but I often will go nine, 10 or whatever.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:42):**  And that's honestly just because I love what I do. And I think of the kind of like the  weekdays as my bow time and the weekends as the rest of my lifetime.  So do you really not work on the weekends? You manage to do that?  
**[0:50:54-0:50:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:50:54):**  Yeah, mostly. I think if I do anything on the weekend, it's only because something,  you know, I get like a jolt of energy or something or it's legitimately something that only can  be done on the weekends. But it's a pretty rare thing for me.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:51:06):**  Long hours aren't for everyone. And that's worth considering before joining a startup.  But one of the big benefits is the really strong team culture where everyone's constantly  doing whatever it takes to move the mission forward. That's what Karen likes the most  
**[0:51:19-0:51:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:51:19):**  about being in a startup.  We've all got the vision of where we want to head. So everyone just gets in and helps  get the job done. And if something goes wrong, everyone stays back and puts in the hard yards  
**[0:51:33-0:51:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:51:33):**  to just keep the company progressing forward where sometimes there's tendencies in multinational  companies or big companies that they sort of lose sight a little bit of sometimes it  feels like they lose sight of the employees in a sense. And you feel like you're just  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:51:55):**  a number to the company where you're there just to get the job done and that's it. And  so that was really appealing with Go Terra. Everyone's involved. Olympia being the CEO,  she's out on the tractor, you know, shoveling waste as well. Yeah, the same just with everyone  
**[0:52:13-0:52:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:52:13):**  else which is an eye-opener when coming from some larger companies where it'd be fairly  wouldn't happen essentially.  Yeah, it's fairly something. I think it wouldn't happen. Not to mention Go Terra is unique  
**[0:52:29-0:52:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:52:29):**  in that you literally are shoveling waste. Like that's not a metaphorical statement.  Yeah, literally shoveling waste. Yep. Shoveling waste onto conveyors and going through your  packaging which isn't the most glorious part of the job but everyone does it. So as part  
**[0:52:48-0:52:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:52:48):**  of a team, it doesn't matter what position you're in within Go Terra. Everyone has their  fair crack at shoveling the waste.  But aside from the shoveling, startups create an opportunity to rapidly learn new skills.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:53:02):**  After Alyssa left FBN, she continued to work in agtech startups with companies like Florissat,  a cloud-based crop analytics company and now Steward, a crowdfunding platform for diversified  farms which has thrown her into the finance industry as much as agriculture.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:53:18):**  So I'm currently at a company called Steward that is a sustainable investment platform  for diversified, virginate farms. So we're primarily focused on anything outside of the  commodity agriculture space primarily because there's funding options for the corn and soybean  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:53:33):**  growers that are out there or other commodity crops. I talk about corn and soybeans because  I'm from Missouri and currently in Michigan. So I talk about Midwest crops. So Steward  is a platform for those farms that don't really have alternative funding options. It's like  
**[0:53:47-0:53:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:53:47):**  the finance world of agriculture which I knew nothing about before joining. And so it's  really cool to learn more about farm financing and the specific challenges that farmers face  with gaining access to capital, particularly these small diversified farms that are doing  
**[0:54:02-0:54:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:54:02):**  something totally different. And even, you know, I'm working with a farmer right now  that is a cattle farmer in Eastern Oregon and he just can't, he wants to grass finish  the whole way through and he can't get a loan from his FSA office because that means holding  
**[0:54:19-0:54:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:54:19):**  onto the cattle for an extra 15 months. So it's even kind of these farms that are doing  anything at the fringes that don't fit into like the model that the FSA or the US kind  of agriculture banking system has built. We take on all those types of projects and so  
**[0:54:35-0:54:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:54:35):**  it's been really cool to learn everything from like micro dairies to learning about  smaller scale production methods like high tunnels and working on the shoulders of the  season, all the way to, you know, this regenerative beef farmer that I'm talking about.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:54:50):**  In addition to learning new skills, Alyssa is putting her farmer-facing sales and listening  skills to work.  So my day to day, I manage kind of the farmer experience. So we're still a very small company.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:55:01):**  I think I was employee number eight or nine. So we're very small, still building it out,  figuring out what works and I'm managing and working on the whole farmer experience side.  So right now I am working with a lot of farmers, everything from kind of the initial application  
**[0:55:18-0:55:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:55:18):**  all the way to getting their product live. And it's both a, I'm on the phone with farmers,  but also helping our product team think about how can farmers interact with the product  and what will work and everything from phone calls with farmers, emails to working on kind  
**[0:55:35-0:55:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:55:35):**  of bigger strategy.  How do farmers think and work and how do we, what types of partnerships would work? And  it's really cool because it has a lot of finance folks. Like it's primarily a finance company.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:55:46):**  And so internally we have a lot of these discussions of we have people with finance backgrounds  and there's a couple of us with agriculture backgrounds and figuring out how to meld our  specialties and knowledge to create a product for farmers that really works.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:00):**  But I absolutely love it. It's a really fun team. It's a very mission driven company and  it's really cool. It's a totally remote work environment. And so learning how to communicate  on Slack, my manager uses not just on Slack, but like my manager uses video messages. So  
**[0:56:17-0:56:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:17):**  rather than typing out a long memo, he'll just record a five minute video screen share  or video of himself explaining something. And he is in New Zealand. And so on the completely  different time zone, it works really well. So it's been cool to figure out the asynchronous  
**[0:56:33-0:56:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:33):**  work lifestyle and really make it work.  In many ways, Alyssa is proof that where you start in an industry like ag tech, which for  Alyssa was cold calling a hundred farmers a day, isn't necessarily where you end up.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:45):**  But before we wrap up this episode, we'll leave you with some final tips from each of  our guests. Here's Karen.  Well, it's just to give it a go, because when you come from a big company or a corporation,  
**[0:56:59-0:57:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:56:59):**  you sometimes think that you have that sense of job security where in a startup, there's  so many unknowns where not in terms of job security, but just because when you're trying  to design new technology or new products, you just got to have confidence and what you're  
**[0:57:21-0:57:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:57:21):**  doing come with an open mind that and the vision that what we're doing is for the right  reason and it's just hard work to get there. So it can be definitely a busy and a fast  moving, like fast paced industry. But I wouldn't go back.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:57:40):**  Our agriculture and food system, I view as one of the same. So even though I'm more on  the agriculture side, I still think I also work in the food space. And when those come  together, like we all eat three times a day. It's something that everybody can relate to.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:57:53):**  So advice for people looking into get into the ag food tech space is just go on a LinkedIn,  go into networks and actually just like reach out to people because people are so willing  to help. And I think that's probably true across other startups as well. There is ultimately  
**[0:58:10-0:58:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:58:10):**  like a lot of people, if you just ask them what they're doing and treat it as a life  interview versus, hey, can I have a job? It'll open up hundreds of possibilities.  My first piece of advice is do it because there is a huge, huge amount of opportunity,  
**[0:58:29-0:58:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:58:29):**  a huge amount of important unsolved problems, far more than I think you'll find in places  like Software as a Service or building the next social media app. I really do believe  that. Secondly, I think just get involved. I mean, what I mean by that is like one of  
**[0:58:48-0:58:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:58:48):**  the things that really differentiates people who are successful in startups versus who  aren't, I think is just simply bias towards action. So not people who talk about it, who  think about it, who intellectualize it, but just jump in. So whether that's helping out  
**[0:59:02-0:59:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:59:02):**  a farmer or writing some code for somebody or doing it, just by trying something, just  by seeing what sticks, you will learn faster than people around you. And you'll be around  to solve the important problem when you find it, when somebody finds you with it. So just  
**[0:59:20-0:59:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:59:20):**  get started, get involved with anybody you can, find collaborators, put ideas out there,  write about it. As long as you're biasing towards action, you will find the problems  that really gravitate for you.  
**[0:59:35-0:59:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/13/what-its-really-like-to-work-in-an-agtech-startup#t=0:59:35):**  And that's it for another episode of AgTech So What.

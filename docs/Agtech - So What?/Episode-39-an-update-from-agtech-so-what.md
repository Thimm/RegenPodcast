### Agtech - So What?  (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 04:29:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome back to Ag Tech So What. My name is Sarah Nolette, your host and the  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:00:07):**  founder of AgTentic, a boutique strategy advisory firm working to help bring more practical,  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:00:12):**  useful technologies and new business models to agriculture. This episode is a bit different  
**[0:00:17-0:00:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:00:17):**  and I promise I'll keep it short. We don't have a guest today, just some reflections  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:00:20):**  from me and an update on where Ag Tech So What is headed over the coming episodes. Over  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:00:25):**  the past about 10 episodes and what we called season two, we featured more guests on the  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:00:30):**  Ag side rather than the Ag Tech side. So farmers, agronomists, consultants, and a few researchers.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:00:36):**  I love these episodes because I got to learn a ton. I don't come from an Ag background  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:00:41):**  and it's really important to talk to folks with expertise in the Ag side as much as on  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:00:45):**  the Ag Tech side. Hopefully there was a lot for you all to learn as well, whether you  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:00:49):**  do come from Ag or Ag Tech. In listening back, we've noticed that some themes are emerging.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:00:55):**  For example, adoption of technology and agriculture is a big one that we've covered. We covered  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:00:59):**  this both from the research side and from the farmer side and a bit from consultants  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:01:03):**  and agronomists as well. Another one is farmers getting involved in creating technologies  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:01:08):**  or even creating Ag Tech startups. So we heard from several guests like Will McSmith, Chris  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:01:13):**  McVauklin and Chris and Carl Lippert, sorry, on their journey from Ag into Ag Tech. This  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:01:18):**  is a big area that we're passionate about at AgTentic is harnessing and unlocking the  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:01:23):**  power of producers and Ag experts to actually create or be part of creating Ag Tech companies  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:01:29):**  or technologies for practical use in agriculture. And I'm sure we'll cover more of that in the  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:01:34):**  future. Moving forward, rather than have these themes just kind of emerge as they did and  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:01:39):**  as I follow different lines of questioning, we want to be much more intentional and focused  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:01:43):**  in what we're covering with each guest. So we're going to be doing four episodes segments  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:01:49):**  on a specific theme. Four episodes where we cover one theme from a couple of different  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:01:53):**  angles, whether that's from investors and farmers and agronomists or depending on who  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:01:58):**  the guests are, really looking at a particular theme from a couple of different angles over  
**[0:02:02-0:02:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:02:02):**  four episodes. And we're really thrilled to have on board some partners to make this possible.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:02:09):**  Themes that we'll cover include social license and the role of technology, new value chains  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:02:13):**  and premium products, novel farming systems and many more that we have thought of and  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:02:18):**  some I'm sure we haven't thought of yet. Our first theme will be getting Ag Tech ready,  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:02:22):**  which will be brought to you in partnership with Decipher. We're really excited to have  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:02:26):**  content partners like Decipher so we can focus in on specific themes and create helpful,  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:02:31):**  practical blog posts for each episode. We'll also be summarizing each theme. So what we've  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:02:36):**  learned over those four episodes, both what was recorded and what you might not have heard  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:02:40):**  on the podcast into an ebook that will be available for download. Other improvements  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:02:46):**  that we'll be making over the coming episodes are things like shorter episodes. We've heard  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:02:50):**  from you that they're a bit long and maybe I talk too much, so we'll be cutting them  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:02:55):**  down and keeping them to less than 30 minutes, really hoping to hit that commute time and  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:03:01):**  keeping it right on target. We'll also be going back to a mix of guests, so we'll definitely  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:03:05):**  still be featuring farmers and ag experts, but we'll also be including ag tech experts  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:03:10):**  like investors and startups as well as agribusinesses. Our guests will be Australian, but also over  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:03:16):**  seas experts and innovators as well. And finally, we'll be experimenting with a range of formats  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:03:22):**  like events, conference talks and panels, reflections from the authentic team, and of  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:03:26):**  course the traditional interview format. And last one, we're also going to create a new  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:03:31):**  logo or a real logo at all, which I'm personally really excited about. So many exciting times  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357501#t=0:03:36):**  ahead and a couple of changes. Thank you as always for your support as a listener or supporter

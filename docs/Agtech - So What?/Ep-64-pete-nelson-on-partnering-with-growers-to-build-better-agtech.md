**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:00:28):**  We also looked at more ag-focused places like St. Louis.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:00:32):**  And today's guest, Pete Nelson, is a champion in one of these places, Tennessee.

**[0:01:26-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:01:26):**  of crops or production approaches could we put into the market that would work for the  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:01:33):**  large row crop farmers in the Mississippi Delta, but that would also be pushing some

**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:01:50):**  which having farmers at the table was the obvious thing you had to do.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:01:55):**  And then from there, we've gotten more and more into some of the ag technologies, ag

**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:01):**  So starting out as a farmer, always working with farmers, and that's just to me the obvious  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:06):**  way.

**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:13):**  So what is AgLaunch and how did it get started?  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:17):**  So AgLaunch is a network of farmers that has stemmed out of two things.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:22):**  One is what was called the Rural Challenge.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:25):**  It was our Tennessee Farm Bureau, our Tennessee Department of Ag, and our local ag university,  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:29):**  University of Tennessee, developing a strategic plan for how to grow more enterprises in rural  
**[0:02:36-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:36):**  Tennessee that would benefit farmers.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:38):**  That was in 2012.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:39):**  In 2015, we wrote a business plan funded by USDA that built on that theme that said how  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:46):**  if we look at all the transitions that are in front of us in terms of technology and  
**[0:02:50-0:02:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:50):**  innovation, how do farmers most benefit from that, and how can they have a stake in that  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:57):**  and essentially be investors in time, energy, otherwise, into the deals that are being developed,  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:04):**  and will that change the quality and lucrativeness of each of the deals?  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:10):**  And so we essentially represent a group of farmers, and as part of that, are assembling  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:16):**  an ecosystem that includes all the normal stuff you would expect, incubation capacity.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:22):**  We have an accelerator program we run for row crops.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:25):**  We're teasing out doing one for livestock.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:28):**  That's on a year-round cadence that we go through recruitment cycle and then make some  
**[0:03:31-0:03:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:31):**  investments and grow towards field trials.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:34):**  So that's moving the Farm Credit Fund with our partner, ANOVA.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:39):**  They're making investments.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:40):**  We've had a perfect exit, and we see that work kind of expanding into other regions  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:44):**  across the country.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:46):**  But underneath all that is a group of farmers.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:48):**  And at least in the United States, I think we're the only one running a nationally known  
**[0:03:53-0:04:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:53):**  acceleration program and working through investment that is owned exclusively by farmers.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:00):**  What Pete is describing is a pretty non-traditional model for accelerator programs in ag tech.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:05):**  So how does it actually work commercially?  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:07):**  Who pays?  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:09):**  When I say that, there's a bunch of different sort of management structures, but the Ag  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:14):**  Launch Initiative is a nonprofit organization.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:18):**  So we're a 501c3 IRS designated nonprofit.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:22):**  And we do that because we get revenue from and project money from the federal government,  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:28):**  state government, and philanthropy with the goal of stimulating small businesses and rural  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:33):**  economies and also dealing with urban food deserts, food systems.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:38):**  And so the nonprofit piece is what kind of allows it to be driven.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:42):**  Certainly one of the things that's probably most unique about the program is the way in  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:45):**  which farmers are involved and get equity in the companies.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:48):**  Can you tell us more about that?  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:50):**  Our sister organization is Ag Launch Partners, which is a group of farmers that are organized

**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:05:15):**  for this.

**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:05:19):**  was about the chasm and early adopters versus mainstream.

**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:05:35):**  who are like that.

**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:05:42):**  Everybody else is at some level of being a follower behind that, much more traditional  
**[0:05:47-0:05:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:05:47):**  in thinking.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:05:48):**  And what most of the folks that are out that don't know agriculture, they are either dealing

**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:00):**  We have this many growers and we all know, you look at it and you go, well, those are

**[0:06:07-0:06:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:07):**  And then that rest of everybody are much more recalcitrant than just other sectors that  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:15):**  might have slower adopters.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:17):**  So that's still the environment.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:18):**  The biggest thing that's changing is, at least in our view, is that what's called the disappearing  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:25):**  middle and that's the, it's not really a farm size, but it's a mentality size.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:30):**  So this is where you get all the sociology information around the average farmer is 60  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:34):**  years old.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:35):**  There's no succession plan, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:37):**  They're sort of waiting for the commodity markets to be right, traditionally growing  
**[0:06:42-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:42):**  corn and soybeans.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:44):**  That sort of mindset around agriculture is fundamentally shifting.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:48):**  And so what you have is two pockets of farmers.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:52):**  Some are really, really, really big farms and some are really, really small local farms  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:57):**  that are both entrepreneurs in the way that they think.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:00):**  And this has nothing to do, again, it's farm size is one way to think about it, but this  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:04):**  is about how you bring entrepreneurship together.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:06):**  So those two types of farms, the leadership, are pretty identical in terms of personality  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:13):**  types, how they think about entrepreneurship.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:15):**  That's who we're targeting.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:17):**  And the assumption is that folks that are sort of following trends are going to come  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:21):**  along with it.

**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:23):**  So to answer your question, simply, Cass, we're still targeting by nature early adopter,  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:28):**  first generation, use case farmers.

**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:37):**  looks to other growers.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:39):**  Long term, we believe there's going to be a lot more, what we're now terming as early  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:43):**  adopters, a lot more farmers that are entrepreneurial and innovative just by the nature of where  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:47):**  agriculture is going.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:48):**  And so the percentage of those is going to go up.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:51):**  But the overall percentage probably of farmers as we think about it now may go down.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:57):**  Yeah.

**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:08:01):**  looking at all the very earliest rural sociology of adoption papers.

**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:08:10):**  And the correlation was so strongly in favor of basically the larger the farm, the more

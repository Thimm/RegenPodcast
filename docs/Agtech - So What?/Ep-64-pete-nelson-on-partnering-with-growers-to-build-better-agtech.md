### Agtech - So What?  (2020-04-08)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast, brought to you by Agthentik.  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  And today I'm joined by a guest host, Cass Mao.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:00:12):**  Cass is a principal advisor at Agthentik, and she's joining me today because of a report  we wrote on agtech ecosystems.  Basically, we looked at what's happening in the United States and teased out lessons for  
**[0:00:25-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:00:25):**  Australia.  But we didn't just look at Silicon Valley.  We also looked at more ag-focused places like St. Louis.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:00:32):**  And today's guest, Pete Nelson, is a champion in one of these places, Tennessee.  Pete is the president at AgLaunch, an innovation development organization that supports agtech  through what they call a farmer-centric innovation model, something that's very close to our  
**[0:00:48-0:01:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:00:48):**  hearts.  Cass and I asked Pete about what this means, how they do it, and how having growers at  the table fundamentally changes outcomes for startups and for regional communities.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:01:01):**  Here's Pete.  I've been around agriculture my whole life, and I was moved back to the South in the 90s  to start an organic, small organic farm.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:01:13):**  And at that point, there was not a lot of activity that's happening now around local  food systems and organic acres.  And what I got really interested in in the 90s was crop diversification and what kind  
**[0:01:26-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:01:26):**  of crops or production approaches could we put into the market that would work for the  large row crop farmers in the Mississippi Delta, but that would also be pushing some  of the long-term sustainability goals that I had, that being environmental but also job  
**[0:01:43-0:01:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:01:43):**  creation, economic well-being, et cetera.  And so the first 10 years of my career, it was focused on the specialty crop piece of  which having farmers at the table was the obvious thing you had to do.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:01:55):**  And then from there, we've gotten more and more into some of the ag technologies, ag  tech.  It's just been a natural offshoot.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:01):**  So starting out as a farmer, always working with farmers, and that's just to me the obvious  way.  If you're going to build something, capturing that knowledge base is fundamental to getting  
**[0:02:12-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:12):**  everything off the ground.  So what is AgLaunch and how did it get started?  So AgLaunch is a network of farmers that has stemmed out of two things.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:22):**  One is what was called the Rural Challenge.  It was our Tennessee Farm Bureau, our Tennessee Department of Ag, and our local ag university,  University of Tennessee, developing a strategic plan for how to grow more enterprises in rural  
**[0:02:36-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:36):**  Tennessee that would benefit farmers.  That was in 2012.  In 2015, we wrote a business plan funded by USDA that built on that theme that said how  
**[0:02:46-0:03:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:02:46):**  if we look at all the transitions that are in front of us in terms of technology and  innovation, how do farmers most benefit from that, and how can they have a stake in that  and essentially be investors in time, energy, otherwise, into the deals that are being developed,  
**[0:03:04-0:03:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:04):**  and will that change the quality and lucrativeness of each of the deals?  And so we essentially represent a group of farmers, and as part of that, are assembling  an ecosystem that includes all the normal stuff you would expect, incubation capacity.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:22):**  We have an accelerator program we run for row crops.  We're teasing out doing one for livestock.  That's on a year-round cadence that we go through recruitment cycle and then make some  
**[0:03:31-0:03:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:31):**  investments and grow towards field trials.  So that's moving the Farm Credit Fund with our partner, ANOVA.  They're making investments.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:40):**  We've had a perfect exit, and we see that work kind of expanding into other regions  across the country.  But underneath all that is a group of farmers.  
**[0:03:48-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:03:48):**  And at least in the United States, I think we're the only one running a nationally known  acceleration program and working through investment that is owned exclusively by farmers.  What Pete is describing is a pretty non-traditional model for accelerator programs in ag tech.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:05):**  So how does it actually work commercially?  Who pays?  Yeah.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:09):**  When I say that, there's a bunch of different sort of management structures, but the Ag  Launch Initiative is a nonprofit organization.  So we're a 501c3 IRS designated nonprofit.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:22):**  And we do that because we get revenue from and project money from the federal government,  state government, and philanthropy with the goal of stimulating small businesses and rural  economies and also dealing with urban food deserts, food systems.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:38):**  And so the nonprofit piece is what kind of allows it to be driven.  Certainly one of the things that's probably most unique about the program is the way in  which farmers are involved and get equity in the companies.  
**[0:04:48-0:05:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:04:48):**  Can you tell us more about that?  Our sister organization is Ag Launch Partners, which is a group of farmers that are organized  around data, land, knowledge, specific regions and crops that are the ones that are actually  
**[0:05:03-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:05:03):**  in the middle of some of the deals that we're involved in.  And those two things run, it's really a public-private sort of partnership all kind of under one  umbrella.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:05:10):**  Yeah.  I listened to the Tim Hamrick's podcast you did, the interview you did in preparation  for this.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:05:16):**  And one of the things that you started talking about with Tim towards the end of that conversation  was about the chasm and early adopters versus mainstream.  It got me really curious about whether the farmers that you work with through Ag Launch  
**[0:05:26-0:05:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:05:26):**  Partners, whether they identify as early adopters or whether there are some more mainstream  and more representative of the broader majority of farmers, whether there's people in there  who are like that.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:05:37):**  You've got that three, four, five percent that are the real crazy early adopters.  Everybody else is at some level of being a follower behind that, much more traditional  in thinking.  
**[0:05:48-0:06:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:05:48):**  And what most of the folks that are out that don't know agriculture, they are either dealing  with that three, four, five percent and they're really enthusiastic.  You all and I have seen plenty of slides.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:00):**  We have this many growers and we all know, you look at it and you go, well, those are  the crazy people that would be involved in any new thing you were doing or anybody else.  And then that rest of everybody are much more recalcitrant than just other sectors that  
**[0:06:15-0:06:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:15):**  might have slower adopters.  So that's still the environment.  The biggest thing that's changing is, at least in our view, is that what's called the disappearing  
**[0:06:25-0:06:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:25):**  middle and that's the, it's not really a farm size, but it's a mentality size.  So this is where you get all the sociology information around the average farmer is 60  years old.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:35):**  There's no succession plan, et cetera, et cetera.  They're sort of waiting for the commodity markets to be right, traditionally growing  corn and soybeans.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:44):**  That sort of mindset around agriculture is fundamentally shifting.  And so what you have is two pockets of farmers.  Some are really, really, really big farms and some are really, really small local farms  
**[0:06:57-0:07:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:06:57):**  that are both entrepreneurs in the way that they think.  And this has nothing to do, again, it's farm size is one way to think about it, but this  is about how you bring entrepreneurship together.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:06):**  So those two types of farms, the leadership, are pretty identical in terms of personality  types, how they think about entrepreneurship.  That's who we're targeting.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:17):**  And the assumption is that folks that are sort of following trends are going to come  along with it.  And we do that.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:23):**  So to answer your question, simply, Cass, we're still targeting by nature early adopter,  first generation, use case farmers.  But as we scale through the field days and our various programs, we're given a lot of  
**[0:07:37-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:37):**  looks to other growers.  Long term, we believe there's going to be a lot more, what we're now terming as early  adopters, a lot more farmers that are entrepreneurial and innovative just by the nature of where  
**[0:07:47-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:47):**  agriculture is going.  And so the percentage of those is going to go up.  But the overall percentage probably of farmers as we think about it now may go down.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:07:56):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I think certainly with the report that we wrote, we went down the rabbit hole of  
**[0:08:01-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:08:01):**  looking at all the very earliest rural sociology of adoption papers.  And it looks a lot at the role of size in mediating farmers willingness to adopt technology.  And the correlation was so strongly in favor of basically the larger the farm, the more  
**[0:08:14-0:08:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:08:14):**  likely they were to be an early adopter.  So tell me more about why you think that.  If you think about businesses that need high capitalization or they need an IT person to  
**[0:08:25-0:08:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:08:25):**  help them scale, but what we try not to lose sight of is the folks that are sort of leading  the development of these hyper localized food systems, even if it's like poor college kids  and they're not making a good living, but they're trying to figure out a new way to  
**[0:08:39-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:08:39):**  grow leafy greens year round using climate control or they're trying to figure out whatever  the technology is.  Those are hyper early adopters.  
**[0:08:49-0:09:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:08:49):**  They're just under resourced.  And so part of our approach has been get the crazy small local food folks and the crazy  big ag folks and make sure those are both in our network.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:09:01):**  At Ag Launch, Pete and his team bring these different kinds of farmers together to share  the different ways that they're innovating and to give the startups they work with, both  in ag tech and value adding, a broader view of agriculture.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:09:14):**  This feedback helps the startups to improve their products and scale their companies.  We've now done about 30 companies through this system on the tech side and over half  dozen on the value add, meaning we're growing or processing an actual crop or something  
**[0:09:30-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:09:30):**  with a different type of margin.  But in those tech companies, I mean, those companies have been selected by a group of  farmers to participate.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:09:40):**  That's the primary part of our program is how do they interact, how do they grow working  with the farmers.  And it's really interesting that we had one of our most successful panels that we did.  
**[0:09:50-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:09:50):**  They're three partners, a one acre year round leafy green producer that literally looks  like he's a local food person off of a poster, you know, with the straw hat and all that.  A 2000 acre corn, cotton, soybean rotation, no-till farmer that's kind of more mom and  
**[0:10:08-0:10:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:10:08):**  pop, but a larger grower.  And then a 50,000 acre farm management company that is like a six generation farm operation.  All three of those, which you would never normally think would be operating together.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:10:20):**  That team itself has given some of the best advice as an aggregate of anything you're  going to find in the world.  And that's because they've been working together for a good long amount of time.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:10:31):**  From an actual startup perspective, companies like Shepherd that's building a labor management  software system to just to help you understand real cost of what it takes to run your operation  from a labor perspective and how to deploy labor.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:10:44):**  They've been able to run pilots across all those farm sizes and not only get the data  back and the information back, but actually get an aggregate, the feedback from the different  farmer groups on their solution.

One of the things that we think about a lot with coaching startups is being a startup  
**[0:11:09-0:11:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:11:09):**  is being overwhelmed with advice and feedback and the art of listening enough to your customers,  but having a really strong conviction about the direction of the product and where it's  going to go.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:11:20):**  So that way you don't perhaps overcorrect for your first few customers in a way that  maybe blocks you from reaching the rest of the market.  Have you seen companies fall into that trap in AgLaunch or if not, how have you seen them  
**[0:11:30-0:11:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:11:30):**  avoid it?  When a startup gets to us, typically they have been through a program, and I don't want  to start naming them, but we all know, like what we did a couple of years ago Sarah, when  
**[0:11:41-0:11:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:11:41):**  we were looking into inventory, all the accelerator program, that some of them are big name accelerator  programs, some of them are more regional.  But typically a startup has been through one of those programs, think they have their sort  
**[0:11:52-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:11:52):**  of solution set, proof of concept, at least ready.  Some of them already have sales and generally don't have an idea at all what it's really  going to take or what their value proposition is when you get to a farm level.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:12:05):**  And so that's been surprising.  You would think that that would not be that way, but that's been almost universal.  What you will find is that our network of farmers have not been doing this a long enough  
**[0:12:14-0:12:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:12:14):**  time and participating.  They're giving advice fundamentally different than how you would think about if a focus  group was pulled together for Bayer or Curteva to find out about the next type of seed or  
**[0:12:28-0:12:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:12:28):**  a group that didn't really understand farming was kind of, let's pull some growers together  and see what they have to say about something.  So I would say no, in fact, our farmers are the ones, because we believe in peer to peer  
**[0:12:39-0:12:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:12:39):**  marketing, we don't believe things are necessarily going to get scaled to the big companies,  that that's not the most effective way to get a real technology to market, et cetera,  that we think that there's no way you could actually survive or have something viable  
**[0:12:53-0:13:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:12:53):**  as we're now seeing in the landscape without this network giving feedback at the beginning.  Now to your point on multiple cooks in the kitchen, we have to do a lot of energy with  our mentors and our investor partners and everybody to understand our model, because  
**[0:13:11-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:13:11):**  what we're advising companies to do is in a lot of ways very different than what they're  going to get from somewhere else.  Build a three-year research plan, work with land grants and extension and a bunch of boring  
**[0:13:22-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:13:22):**  stuff like that, making sure if you've got a water efficiency technology, then University  of Georgia and Kansas State, Manhattan, the water schools need to be publishing and writing  about what you're doing, three-year field plan, how to have the growers participating  
**[0:13:41-0:13:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:13:41):**  in the ramp up and stage that appropriately, all those things that sound so boring compared  to like, go sell it and break it and sell it and break it and sell it and break it.  We fundamentally just don't believe that works in agriculture and it's a small group of people,  
**[0:13:55-0:14:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:13:55):**  all things considered, and everybody knows what's going on.  And so we feel like that's one of the reasons there have been so many failures, it's just  a complete disconnect with how to actually interact with the industry.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:14:06):**  Pete believes that the ag launch model of having growers involved earlier will actually  change how ag tech is adopted and how a startup can go from working with just early adopter  farmers to building something that gets in the hands of the mainstream and still adds  
**[0:14:21-0:14:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:14:21):**  value.  You're always going to have growers that aren't on the front lines, but what was going to  happen, we believe, is that the early adopters, instead of it just being they're trying a  
**[0:14:34-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:14:34):**  product out for somebody and then maybe it works and giving a little bit of sort of feedback  that because they're in the middle of the deals, the way those get brought to the later  adopter growers are going to be fundamentally different.  
**[0:14:49-0:15:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:14:49):**  Even more peer-to-peer, even more local distribution, those sort of things.  And so you don't have the same wall that I think you have now if you went through a path  of technology comes out of Silicon Valley, starts beating on some doors, gets a few looks  
**[0:15:05-0:15:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:15:05):**  first and then has this huge jump to get over.  You're sort of building the bridge over the chasm as you go about taking this sort of  farmer approach.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:15:16):**  Can you tell us, sorry, about a company that you guys are working with that's doing that?  Yeah, I mean, it's something, yeah, and I will say that's something that's fundamentally  different with fourth wave technologies than third wave technology.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:15:27):**  If you're putting a trait out there or a mode of action, a synthetic chemical, it's either  we're ready to sell or we're not.  There's some pre-regulated trials and a few things that can go on, but it's either ready  
**[0:15:40-0:15:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:15:40):**  or not.  And so with this, it can be baked along the way a little bit as long as the growers risk  is remunerated correctly.  
**[0:15:49-0:16:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:15:49):**  So a great example is we're building with our farmer network side by side with Rabbit  Tractor out of Indiana.  It's a small autonomy, swarm autonomy play to do cover crops, core storage sampling,  
**[0:16:03-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:16:03):**  other things.  But we are in the third year of developing the product, working with Zach and his team,  but we're right now planting cover crops.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:16:12):**  We planted crops last fall after corn and actually using it and working on it.  And growers in our network have letters of intent to do more of it this year.  And that's a great example because you're both, we're taking advantage of what Zach's  
**[0:16:28-0:16:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:16:28):**  built and we're actually getting cover crops in the field.  But really the process beyond that is we're building acres into proving that two autonomous  vehicles can communicate with each other and plant and what that looks like from energy  
**[0:16:43-0:16:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:16:43):**  efficiency and building value in the company at the same time.  And the fact that the grower is not just getting the benefit of, hey, cool, I get some cover  crops planted, but they're also getting the benefit of they own part of the company that's  
**[0:16:57-0:17:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:16:57):**  getting value created.  That's a great example of like when this thing's working, it's going to have those two elements  happening at the same time.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:17:06):**  When you originally explained this model, Pete, to growers, did it kind of click automatically  for some?  Or were they like a bit skeptical of doing this kind of work and be rewarded in that  
**[0:17:18-0:17:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:17:18):**  kind of way versus a more traditional kind of cash or fee for service?  I mean, if farmers trust you, I mean, first of all, I'll say is that the initial farmers  that are in our network, Scott Fullen, Grant Norwood, but Scott in particular, we've been  
**[0:17:34-0:17:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:17:34):**  screwing around with these ideas for 12, 13 years.  Most of the farmers were involved in the network that we're finding across the country are  folks that were involved with Chicago Climate Exchange and figuring out carbon in the 90s  
**[0:17:49-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:17:49):**  in the early 2000s, et cetera, et cetera.  Same thing with cover crops, these other things.  And so generally the pitch of join a network and potentially own part of a portfolio and  
**[0:18:03-0:18:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:18:03):**  help relook at the entire way this ecosystem that we believe is not functioning well now  can be built, there's not anybody that's innovative in ag on a farm level that wouldn't be into  that pitch.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:18:15):**  Now then the question is, are you trusted?  Have you built the network with the groups that tech folks think are probably boring  in long term?  
**[0:18:23-0:18:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:18:23):**  USDA, Farm Bureau, to do what we're doing, it's not just selling the grower.  You have to bring along all the institutions that are traditional ag institutions and kind  of get everybody rolling in the same direction.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:18:37):**  So the other thing is our whole deal, we're innovating as we go.  And so we're building this with the farmers.  They're part of it every step.  
**[0:18:47-0:19:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:18:47):**  Beyond just trials and building trust, Pete is looking at other ways to help startups  get to market faster and with better products.  We're working right now on building a data commons where all of our acres and growers  
**[0:19:01-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:19:01):**  would have all of their field level data aggregated that could then be used by our startup partners  faster quicker than kind of going from farm to farm and some of the ways we've been doing.  That's just now being built after 12 months of talking about it as one of the next steps.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:19:18):**  Or like the fund that we worked with, with ANOVA, with Farm Credit, that came out of  discussions with the farmers.  We can't count on traditional venture capital in ag that are folks that have come out of  
**[0:19:31-0:19:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:19:31):**  some of the big companies or sitting in some of the big urban centers.  We've got to figure out capital sources that are aligned with our timing and etc.  Those are just two examples.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:19:40):**  But I just want to make sure you guys are getting the impression, which I think you  are.  This is not a fully just sign up that works as we're building it.  
**[0:19:49-0:20:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:19:49):**  We continue to add pieces, learn from additional farmers and keep pushing it like that.  Most things in agriculture take a while to build and for sure models like this that are  pushing the envelope and non-traditional do.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:20:02):**  Do you have any stories of things that you've tried that haven't worked, like an engagement  with a grower or a type of model or something you thought might work and it totally didn't?  One of the things that led us down the tech area is just our long experience with propping  
**[0:20:20-0:20:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:20:20):**  up alternative crops in traditional row crop areas and just how hard that is.  So from a career perspective, there's me and several others in our ecosystem that have  spent a long time trying to work on propping up things that technically should work, winter  
**[0:20:37-0:20:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:20:37):**  oil seeds, alternative grains, others that have been a much longer slog than we thought.  That's one of the things that have led us into, can we use our network of growers and  get some tech things moving quicker and faster?  
**[0:20:49-0:20:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:20:49):**  And so that'd be a big example of a whole area that is just so complex.  There are so many pieces.  The margins are tight that have been really, really hard to get up and moving.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:20:59):**  Another thing in our current model that is not, right now we are still operating where  each farmer, although we're organized as a business unit, each farmer generally has their  own deal with each startup.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:21:14):**  And so we put the deals together, they're favorable for everybody, but there's risk  involved in that the farmers are not able to pull all the deals.  We're building that out now.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:21:24):**  And so that would be one, although I don't have a glaring failure, but that's a clear  thing that long-term without actually getting everybody's risk and reward pulled a little  better, that's going to be a hard slog for us to kind of keep going the way that we're  
**[0:21:36-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:21:36):**  doing.  And then we've had some companies, some of them in hindsight we should have seen immediately  that just even though we had explained, here's what we're doing, here's how to interact with  
**[0:21:46-0:21:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:21:46):**  our farm partners, they just right off the bat, they've been listening to somebody on  one of the coasts and they just couldn't help themselves.  So the moment they got in the door, they're like, here's how you sign up.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:21:58):**  We're ready to sell you.  And those universally have gone nowhere and have turned into, you know, there's no company  that has done that that is still in business yet.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:22:08):**  I'll just put it that way.  Do you get pushback about this model from like, are there people who kind of are not  sold I guess on this?  
**[0:22:16-0:22:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:22:16):**  Another challenge we've been thinking a lot about is the individual nature of some of  these interventions.  Like it's one farmer with one startup and that's a lot of effort for one thing.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:22:25):**  And yes, you hope that that goes really well and spreads adoption and they become champions,  but the leverage point can sometimes feel quite small.  I feel like that the overall community is really small and are generally people all  
**[0:22:39-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:22:39):**  of like goodwill.  So we get along, I think, with all the different, if you put it in groups, folks that are running  accelerators and venture capital, the commodity groups.  
**[0:22:48-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:22:48):**  Now I have not heard as many people say what we sort of clearly say is we fundamentally  believe that this is, you know, we're entering this fourth wave of innovation.  The first wave was domestication, second wave was industrialization, the third wave were

And that we fundamentally believe the yield increases from those technologies have had  
**[0:23:22-0:23:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:23:22):**  a inverse correlation to the profitability of farmers and that the ecosystems built around  those technologies are perfect for those types of technologies, but that's not what consumers  want anymore.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:23:35):**  And so as we go into the fourth wave, you guys touched on in your report, IT functions,  AI, robotics, biologics, lower regulatory barrier technologies, that there's going to  be an entirely different ecosystem that emerges.  
**[0:23:49-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:23:49):**  Our case is that should be owned by farmers or partly owned by farmers.  The jury is still out on that, but, and there are plenty of people I think that shoot at  that.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:24:00):**  I mean, you know, there's four big seed companies, biotech companies, and they spend  $6 billion a year on R&D, blah, blah, blah, blah.  How could we possibly create a disruptive engine in the midst of things like that?  
**[0:24:15-0:24:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:24:15):**  Because we believe in US agriculture, you know, we have plus trillion dollars worth  of farm-based assets, largely in land, but also in equipment and processing capability.  And because there's farmers and the smartest people playing the game, if they can be networked  
**[0:24:30-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:24:30):**  together, and we have the data and we're unlocking capital sources, we believe that what we're  building is the way to build the right ecosystem for the fourth wave and that that'll take  off and that we're building the way that it will be done.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:24:47):**  And that's something that what nobody can argue with is it despite all the quote unquote  investment that's happened to date, this thing is not a winner by a long shot right now.  We're still talking about exits that happened three years ago.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:24:59):**  Yeah.  Tell us more about the crop diversification.  Like I love the idea that disruption and changing farming practices and systems to align with  
**[0:25:09-0:25:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:25:09):**  consumers isn't about just precision agriculture.  There's also a role for new farming systems and new aspects of diversification.  Do you have any exciting examples of that?  
**[0:25:19-0:25:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:25:19):**  Yeah, I mean, we're working, I mean, you know, whether they're, you know, you guys are farm  people, so they'll be exciting to you guys, hopefully for the podcast.  We're working, you know, it's all about capturing where are there groups of growers that you  
**[0:25:32-0:25:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:25:32):**  can grow something and process it with a decent enough margin that you're not competing with  the basis number for other competing crops, et cetera.  So we're working with a group of growers right now led by growing acres farms on the Tennessee  
**[0:25:46-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:25:46):**  River that they're in a floodplain, which means for everybody listening that for them,  sometimes it's wet all the way into the spring and they have limited options for getting  a summer crop in.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:26:00):**  So it's either late season soybeans or something else.  So they've been growing just traditional grain sorghum as a feed product for the last six,  seven years.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:26:12):**  And they're in this area where their own Tennessee River, they're kind of isolated from the big  grain handlers and they've been growing grain sorghum.  What we're now doing is working with Texas A&M and some other seed companies to identify  
**[0:26:26-0:26:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:26:26):**  higher value sorghums and building out a whole sort of matrix of growers with identity preservation  around tying into specialty markets around food and beverage.  So that would be non-gluten, some of the high fiber, high protein varieties and building  
**[0:26:43-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:26:43):**  some independent markets for each one of those specialty sorghums.  And so these aren't glamorous, but decent margin and then leveraging the technologies  and everything else we're doing to help prop those up.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:26:58):**  Another one would be, we've got in the Mississippi Delta 13 million acres of prime farmland in  a given year, about 700,000 of that is in winter wheat.  And so you basically have 12 million plus acres in a given year open for another crop  
**[0:27:14-0:27:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:27:14):**  because we're in the south growing cover crops.  If you try to grow radishes or turnips or depending on the cover crop, you get a ton  of biomass just because we have less freezing.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:27:26):**  And so now you have a huge problem with too much material in the field.  So we've been experimenting with using different types of winter oil seeds that you actually  harvest for a crop, but still get a cover crop benefit and have a customer here in Memphis  
**[0:27:39-0:27:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:27:39):**  that's interested in those.  So those are kind of two examples.  One of the things we bring to alternative crop work is a very realistic farm system  
**[0:27:49-0:27:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:27:49):**  approach which you don't see often and folks are trying to bring some of these new crops  to market.  And so we sort of bring that in the technology is obvious.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:27:59):**  You can theoretically create new crop insurance models or different ways of thinking about  herbicide carryover or other things if you've got better data at the field level, which  is how those play off each other.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:28:10):**  Cool.  That's so interesting.  The kind of ability for local ice-food systems to actually pop up and be profitable and effective  
**[0:28:16-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:28:16):**  locally is something that we are, I think, still working towards as a vision here in  Australia.  I would say just as different conversations we've had with people in Australia and stuff,  
**[0:28:26-0:28:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:28:26):**  you all and others, the pockets of people doing this work are out there.  One of the problems we've all had in agriculture, including Australia, certainly in the US,  is we've either been organized around specific commodities or specific initiatives, renewable  
**[0:28:44-0:28:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:28:44):**  energy, or now it's ag tech, when really those are kind of placeholders to get a little flag  going to get some people around really bigger concepts.  And so if we can put the right flag up there, those kind of things where we're just saying,  
**[0:28:58-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:28:58):**  we are about creating businesses, rural, urban, that feed people, that connect farmers into  real opportunity for long-term solvency for the farmers, for the environment.  That's what we're into doing, and we're going to creatively come up with capital sources  
**[0:29:14-0:29:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:29:14):**  and others depending on the margin.  That's what is needed here is some vision around what actually needs to be built.  Right now, we're still in this infancy state, as I think you kind of alluded to in your  
**[0:29:25-0:29:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:29:25):**  report, where we're sort of, right now, we're more like, how do we flip some houses and  buy a dud and polish it a little bit, flip it to one of the big companies?  That's still the stage we're at, and there's a much deeper, more interesting way to think  
**[0:29:38-0:29:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:29:38):**  about this.  What have you seen that's been promising in the last few years of changes in mindsets  or approaches that make it look like perhaps the kind of maturity of thinking is improving?  
**[0:29:48-0:30:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:29:48):**  I mean, I in general like the fact that, and you guys have been pretty influential in this  I think as well, is that if folks at least are talking about having farmers, I mean,  when you all started your work, Sarah, with us, with some visibility, you go to these  
**[0:30:04-0:30:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:30:04):**  conferences and stuff, there wouldn't even be a farmer there.  That's sort of changing, but what is also interesting is there's still not this real  sense of like it still is the farmer is the customer, not a partner in developing the  
**[0:30:17-0:30:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:30:17):**  innovation.  That's been kind of an interesting thing to watch it evolve.  From a commercial perspective, that's probably good for us because there's not that many  
**[0:30:24-0:30:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:30:24):**  games in town that really have it organized in an effective way.  Some of the other changes, I mean, I still am of a premise that we're not thinking about  it correctly, meaning I do think there are more conversations now than there was a year  
**[0:30:38-0:30:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:30:38):**  ago on saying maybe traditional venture capital doesn't work the way we want it to work, or  maybe we're not measuring the right thing.  I think there's a more receptive audience to some of the more out there ideas that we're  
**[0:30:52-0:31:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:30:52):**  putting forward, so that's good.  I still think fundamentally there's a bias towards building these ecosystems, either  like you would for IT or how you would for third wave technologies, highly urbanized,  
**[0:31:06-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:31:06):**  a lot of labs and depending on running into engineers at Starbucks kind of thinking, which  is probably not how this is going to ultimately get built out.  As this fourth wave takes hold, and as we do find more ways of breaking down silos and  
**[0:31:21-0:31:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:31:21):**  getting more farmers involved, Pete sees an opportunity to really think differently about  farming systems and about business models.  As we look at some of the startups we're investing in and others are starting to think about  
**[0:31:33-0:31:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:31:33):**  things like we should build companies starting with how a farm in a unique situation operates  labor, fuel, where are the fields, how it works, build technologies from there because  that's what actually makes sense and that's what actually addresses some of the largest  
**[0:31:53-0:32:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:31:53):**  per acre cost.  And then from there pull data in versus some of these initial plays where it was like huge  data sets and field maps, which really had much more to do with big companies understanding  
**[0:32:06-0:32:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:32:06):**  how to manage their seed inventory or their fertilizer inventory, whatever, sort of as  an aggregate than it had to do with really thinking, you know, all the first wave technologies  were not built from the perspective of like how do you really make a farm operate better?  
**[0:32:21-0:32:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:32:21):**  Because if we had built them that way, we'd obviously have a whole different set of tools.  So I think folks are starting to kind of think a little bit differently about that and then  starting to make some more sort of connections across the supply chain like, oh, we don't  
**[0:32:33-0:32:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:32:33):**  grow more specialty crops because of genetics and not wanting to have human labor doing  all the picking.  Now we have tools that could address that.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:32:44):**  It's a tool, you know, it's at least a twofold problem, but we now have some potential tools  that would allow us to address that problem.  What is that doing up for us?  
**[0:32:53-0:33:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:32:53):**  So I think some of that thinking is starting to happen.  Yeah, totally.  We're super excited about the time and, you know, coronavirus is giving us a bit more  
**[0:33:02-0:33:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:33:02):**  of that and pushing us to think really differently about supply chains.  But you know, in a world where we have autonomous vehicles and we have nonchemical weeding technologies,  can we think really differently about weed management proactively slower at different  
**[0:33:17-0:33:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:33:17):**  times of the growing cycle?  You know, and what does that look like for input usage or, you know, adoption of variable  rate now that chemical supply chains are really constrained is starting to go up.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:33:27):**  And so what does that mean for other precision ag practices that otherwise wouldn't get used  or crop rotations?  We just I just heard about an oat milk dairy company that is now working with dairy farmers  
**[0:33:39-0:33:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:33:39):**  to grow those same oats so that a dairy farm can supply both plant based and animal based  dairy products.  So I just like love those examples of what if the food system looks really, really different  
**[0:33:51-0:33:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:33:51):**  and it's not just, you know, alternative proteins, but really different for farmers as well and  the value that they can create and capture.  I love that.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:33:59):**  So one question I wanted to ask was it's probably a conversation we get into all the time about  kind of the role of traditional VC in supporting ag tech.  And obviously we've got the funds here now and so have to come from some point of view  
**[0:34:10-0:34:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:34:10):**  that there is a place for traditional VC, not traditional VC, but venture capital of  some style.  And so I guess I'm interested how you guys have navigated both Lenovo and with external  
**[0:34:20-0:34:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:34:20):**  co-investors this kind of tension between doing things the way that they need to be  done in order to be kind of effective and meaningful in ag and the trials and so on  versus how bringing in those other sources of capital that look more like traditional  
**[0:34:34-0:34:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:34:34):**  venture have gone.  In the largest sense I would say, as you all well know, there's a big difference.  The venture capital model in terms of LPs and a 220 or however it's organized is not  
**[0:34:46-0:35:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:34:46):**  a bad model.  The idea of returns like in their heyday with some of these, you know, a Kleiner Perkins  or like the Sand Hill Road type returns just might not be possible with ag the way we know  
**[0:35:03-0:35:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:35:03):**  it's going to go.  Meaning if you take the, you know, you go ahead and buy into the idea and it was a great  article today about this, but that Roundup Ready technology and BT technology which were  
**[0:35:15-0:35:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:35:15):**  sort of the only real similarity we have to like scaling up software, you know, we know  those are not the kind of solutions we would want to launch into widespread agriculture.  And so I would argue that the real venture capital, meaning they want whatever they want,

Now using the venture capital model like you guys are using or were using where you have  LPs that are maybe aligned with the vision probably is possible with some of these innovations  
**[0:35:49-0:35:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:35:49):**  and technologies.  Meaning after this short term blip where folks are just trying to flip to big companies,  but like long term growth type businesses.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:35:56):**  So I think that there's a place for the model.  We're trying to adapt it by working, for example, with our farm credit bank system in the States.  We have a program called the Rural Business Investment Company program that's through  
**[0:36:08-0:36:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:36:08):**  its license through USDA that allows farm credit banks to be LPs.  And they of course want a venture return, but they also want their farmer owners, they're  all farm co-ops, they want their owners, their farmers to have long term solvency and have  
**[0:36:26-0:36:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:36:26):**  tools that they can use and be able to get more loans.  And so I think we're going to see more and more hybridized investment models where there's  a food company might have a play in it because of supply chain issues and something organized  
**[0:36:42-0:36:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:36:42):**  like a VC might have a play and the government might be doing a low interest loan all along  sort of a more clearly articulated pathway.  Yeah, that's awesome.  
**[0:36:52-0:37:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:36:52):**  I like the, I mean, I could talk forever about what we're interested in seeing long term  as the ecosystem is developed.  Like I mean, another topic for sure is like how startups go from the early stages of doing  
**[0:37:06-0:37:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:37:06):**  stuff that you know, in quotation marks doesn't scale, like doing the things kind of slowly  and well and working really closely with customers.  And then if you start moving towards being a more mainstream company and on a larger  
**[0:37:17-0:37:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:37:17):**  scale, how do you maintain that sort of farmer base of work and credibility as you have less  time to be able to spend doing each and every trial and spending time with each and every  customer?  
**[0:37:28-0:37:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:37:28):**  Yeah, I have a feeling that you guys are sort of thinking along the same way we are in a  lot of ways in terms of what needs to be built to kind of like talk about an ecosystem that's  taking the things that you just said into account and like thinking about this in sort  
**[0:37:43-0:37:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:37:43):**  of a farm level and scale that way versus turning this into a product that scales like  an Uber or something like that.  For the farmers listening to the podcast, what advice would you have for them in, you  
**[0:37:56-0:38:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:37:56):**  know, if they don't live near Ag Launch or haven't gotten involved with us at Farmers  to Founders or some of the work we're doing, what advice would you have for them in thinking  differently about ag tech and innovation and diversification?  
**[0:38:10-0:38:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:38:10):**  Any kind of tips that come to mind for a farmer out there?  First of all, we're always open to learn anywhere farmers are that are interested in these topics.  If you are a grower and farmer listening to this, I really want to encourage you that  
**[0:38:23-0:38:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:38:23):**  it is still the Wild West out there, unlike some of the last wave of technologies that  really had to be developed by big companies, biotechnology, vaccines, others.  A lot of the new stuff is much more like the old elbow grease innovations that we've all  
**[0:38:40-0:38:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/8/ep-64-pete-nelson-on-partnering-with-growers-to-build-better-agtech#t=0:38:40):**  done on our planters or done in our farm shops just accelerated from that.  And so, you know, if you've got a cool idea, I'm happy to try to interact with you and  find others in your locale that can interact with you about helping move it forward.

We can also provide you some of the business planning that we've done to work on organizing

### Agtech - So What?  (2020-01-07)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:22-0:00:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:00:22):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Welcome to 2020 Ag Tech So What, listeners.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:00:42):**  2019 was a big year for us at Agthentic, and for this podcast, we did 26 episodes with  36 guests, ranging from farmers to researchers to investors and entrepreneurs. Thank you  for your support, and as always, if you like what you're hearing, please leave us a review  
**[0:00:59-0:01:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:00:59):**  or share this podcast with a friend. This year, we'll be making a few changes like we  did last year. For example, you'll hear more from the rest of the Agthentic team, not just  me, and we'll be adding more episodes within particular themes. So more on that soon. But  
**[0:01:16-0:01:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:01:16):**  before we change too many things, today's episode is another look at what's happening  with the farmers to founders boot camp cohort. Just like you heard on episode 55 with Ash  at Training Paddock and David at Farm Service Manager, these are startups that are founded  
**[0:01:32-0:01:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:01:32):**  by farmers. The whole idea behind farmers to founders is to put producers and their  challenges at the center of innovation rather than the technologies. So today I chat with  Fi from Bitwise Agronomy and Lee from Farm Simple. When I spoke with Fi, she was in Launceston,  
**[0:01:50-0:02:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:01:50):**  Tasmania at a co-working space in a heritage building. She starts with her background and  how she came to be in Tassie. So I live in Tasmania. I've got a vineyard called Jingles  Creek Vineyard. We've got a really teeny tiny vineyard. And I worked in technology up in  
**[0:02:09-0:02:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:02:09):**  the mainland, in Sydney and Brisbane, and GIS in New Zealand. So we sort of moved down  to Tassie to be close to my husband's family and bought the love of wine and tech together  in Bitwise Agronomy. And yeah, that's sort of where we're at now.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:02:24):**  So good. So you're a Kiwi originally. You moved to Brisbane and were there working in  the tech industry. What did you do there in terms of technology?  Yes, I worked for a company called AECOM, which is a big civil engineering company.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:02:36):**  We set up a technology as a service team where we built custom products that we thought AECOM  needed and I also worked in the GIS world for a while in Sydney.  Cool. So kind of geospatial stuff and some pretty advanced tech too, from what I understand,  
**[0:02:52-0:03:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:02:52):**  some artificial intelligence and things like that. Is that right?  Yeah. We did some predictive analytics systems that we built where we put reformators and  cameras and stuff on cars and could collect all this data and put it into a sort of an  
**[0:03:08-0:03:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:08):**  integrated visualization system to predict gravel road asset management. And we built  systems to help with sort of rapid disaster recovery, like floods and earthquakes where  we can take lots of images and put it up into the cloud and spit out reports and stuff to  
**[0:03:21-0:03:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:21):**  make the teams a lot quicker and efficient.  Wow. Cool. So then you moved to Tassie and you're on this vineyard. Was there a moment  when you said, oh, all that technology could be used in agriculture or how did you kind  
**[0:03:32-0:03:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:32):**  of come up with the idea for Bitwise Agronomy?  Yeah. Look, I don't know whether the idea for the tech came first or the idea for the  vineyard came first. I think when I moved to Tassie, I was like, oh, I'm not sure what  
**[0:03:43-0:03:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:43):**  the tech industry is like down here. And I thought, well, I'll buy a vineyard. And I  have always had a bit of a passion for ag tech coming from an ag background in New Zealand.  And my uncle's really savvy and engineering savvy, I suppose, on his dairy farm. So I  
**[0:03:59-0:04:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:59):**  always sort of thought, oh, there's really good stuff that could be done. So when I came  down here, I thought, if I don't work in tech, I want to work in wine. And then I think in  the back of my mind, there was always this, but I could have a startup around ag tech  
**[0:04:13-0:04:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:04:13):**  and bringing efficiencies to farming.  Very cool. And so tell us about Bitwise Agronomy. What do you actually do? What problem do you  solve and for whom? How does it work?  
**[0:04:22-0:04:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:04:22):**  Yeah. So Bitwise Agronomy is myself and my co-founder, Aaron. And Aaron and I work together  at AECOM. What we do is we basically want to give time back to farmers. So we've got  a product at the moment that we're working on called Green View. And if you can imagine  
**[0:04:41-0:04:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:04:41):**  Street View for crops, and you take imagery, so like a GPS video of the vines, and we sprinkle  a bit of machine learning on top of that. And that allows farmers to look at the information  and look at the grapes back at home. And lots of vineyard owners have multiple sites and  
**[0:04:59-0:05:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:04:59):**  a lot of vines. So they can really have eyes on the ground and view the grapes whenever  they want from the comfort at their home and cut down the time driving and spending wasted  low value time getting between sites and things like that.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:14):**  Very cool. I love that you say, and then we just sprinkle a bit of machine learning as  if that's a thing that most people can just sprinkle. It sounds so casual to you, but  very impressive.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:23):**  Yes. It's a little bit like hundreds of thousands on the top.  So you see this kind of being for the wine industry initially. Do you imagine it has  applications in other industries or you're pretty focused on wine?  
**[0:05:38-0:05:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:38):**  It definitely has applications in other industries. We've kind of looked at building things like  this in the past for road street signs. You can do sort of asset management on those street  signs. But what we're focusing on first is, I suppose, linear crops and horticulture.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:53):**  And then we want to broaden to more general agriculture and then sort of our three to  five year goal is what other industries that haven't got a system like this could use this.  And the fact that we use really affordable cameras, we really want to give machine learning  
**[0:06:08-0:06:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:08):**  to everyone and to do machine learning as a service in an affordable way.  So how do you think that having the vineyard and being a vineyard owner has impacted your  ability to build this agtech company? Does that really bring a lot of kind of on the  
**[0:06:23-0:06:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:23):**  ground expertise and understanding of the problem or was it kind of things you already  knew anyways?  No, I think it was crucial to having the startup and all the products that we've done in the  
**[0:06:34-0:06:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:34):**  past for other companies and now with Bitwise Agronomy, the key factor is having the knowledge  of the problem that you're solving. And unless you're really immersed in that problem and  experiencing it firsthand, you might not get the technology right. And I think that's a  
**[0:06:48-0:07:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:48):**  really important ingredient for success with technology. You don't want to do tech for  the sake of tech and by being on the ground in the vineyard and living through these problems.  And when we first bought the vineyard, because we were such a tiny tiny vineyard, we were  
**[0:07:03-0:07:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:07:03):**  doing everything manually and really understanding the pain points of everything that was going  on and where the time was wasting was. So I think it's given us a really good foundation  to be able to solve these problems. And I think that if you don't understand the problems,  
**[0:07:18-0:07:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:07:18):**  then technology is just technology.  Sophie does have a, as she says, teeny tiny vineyard. She has deep roots in the agriculture  industry and with rural communities. This has given her a passion for ag, as well as  
**[0:07:33-0:07:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:07:33):**  a deeper understanding of what the users of Bitwise Agronomy are going through.  I grew up in New Zealand and my dad's family's been farming forever down in, well, he grew  up in the Centro Atago region and then moved to the North Island. My auntie and uncle were  
**[0:07:52-0:08:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:07:52):**  farming as well. So I grew up on a sheep and beef farm with a little bit of grain and my  auntie and uncle did various things. They had ended up with dairy, but they did deer  and grain as well and had a really, really large property, which is now my cousin's.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:08:07):**  And they've got quite a large dairy farm there. So yeah, I grew up in a rural environment.  There was anywhere between 12 and, I don't know, 30 people at my primary school, my first  primary school, so we're a little tiny wee community. And yeah, I used to love going  
**[0:08:24-0:08:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:08:24):**  to my uncle Stu's farm. He used to be doing really cool things with tinkering with his,  automating his sheds and his all sorts of stuff. And he was always quite innovative.  I think being exposed to that and from a rural ag sector in New Zealand, which I find is  
**[0:08:44-0:08:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:08:44):**  maybe a little bit more advanced than Australia because, you know, I suppose the number one  industry there, so a little bit more investment happens in it. But, you know, I think that  really gave me my passion to come back to the country lifestyle.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:08:57):**  Even though Fi has a mix of ag and quite deep tech experience, starting a company is still  really hard and she constantly has to push herself out of her comfort zone.  Oh, wow. It's been a rollercoaster, I suppose, like all startups and small businesses as  
**[0:09:12-0:09:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:09:12):**  well. For me, the tech and the building of the tech has been the easy side of things  and bringing the team together because that's what I sort of naturally do in the past in  my day job. I think for me, one of the hard things is getting out there in front of people,  
**[0:09:29-0:09:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:09:29):**  telling them what we've got, engaging in the whole like sales process and clients because  I've always sort of been of the nature that I just really want to help people. So I've  got a tendency just to give everything away for free. Oh, you just use it, you know, this  
**[0:09:44-0:10:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:09:44):**  really helps you. I don't care kind of thing. So to really structure a business around it  and, you know, realize that talking to investors and things like that aren't as scary as what  it seems to be. And I think the other thing is that being in a rural setting, you don't  
**[0:10:00-0:10:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:10:00):**  really have access to a network of other startups and I suppose groups that come together like  you have in your startup hubs in Sydney and Brisbane and Melbourne. There's a small community  down here in Taz but, you know, it can feel quite lonely and isolating and it's quite  
**[0:10:16-0:10:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:10:16):**  hard to find those kind of mentors and stuff. So that's why being on Farmers to Founders  has been great for us. So that's definitely one reason. Any other reasons why you joined  Farmers to Founders bootcamp? Oh, there's so many. To have the push and to be challenged  
**[0:10:33-0:10:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:10:33):**  so I meet my own timeframes. Otherwise you can kind of get caught up with, you know,  other life stuff. So, and yeah, just to have that community and access to mentors and,  you know, talk to other people in the industries like the four day intensive that we had in  
**[0:10:50-0:11:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:10:50):**  Sydney was great, you know, talking to the other startups and, you know, successful startups  now and hearing their journeys and, you know, just that energy that you get from being in  the group just, you know, makes you want to do better and do it faster. Awesome. Tell  
**[0:11:04-0:11:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:11:04):**  me a little bit about, Fi, your vision for the future of Bitwise Agronomy. What do you  hope that this company achieves? Yeah, so I'm really passionate about technology, about  ag and also about rural Australia. So what I really want to do is build a great technology  
**[0:11:23-0:11:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:11:23):**  company out of Tasmania, bring really good skills down to Tasmania and give people opportunity  to have the great lifestyle that Tasmania offers, but also be able to work on really  cool technology and cool solutions and, you know, have the best of both worlds and build  
**[0:11:39-0:11:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:11:39):**  the community down here. Tasmania is a cool island that's great for prototyping for, you  know, sort of global businesses and I really want to help bring that to Tasmania. So that  is Fi, co-founder of Bitwise Agronomy. The link to the website is in the show notes,  
**[0:11:57-0:12:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:11:57):**  so definitely check it out. As I said on the David and Ash episode, we'll be bringing you  an update on where all of these teams get to over the course of the three-month Farmers  to Founders Bootcamp. Maybe you'll even get to hear them pitch. Next up is Lee from Farm  
**[0:12:11-0:12:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:12:11):**  Simple. I caught Lee while he was on holiday in Palm Beach, so his audio is a bit rough  because I didn't want to disturb him too much, so thanks for understanding. Lee starts by  talking about his farm. Our farm is based in northern New South Wales near Moree, so  
**[0:12:27-0:12:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:12:27):**  about four hours in land from the coast, five hours in land from the coast. We've had an  exceptionally dry A in more than almost two years and we're looking for the seasons to  change and get back to some sort of normality. And what do you guys normally farm? What's  
**[0:12:44-0:13:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:12:44):**  a normal season like? Yep, so we call ourselves a mixed farm, but we're predominantly cropping,  so we have about 3,000 hectares of country. 72% of it's arable, so that's a mix of wheat,  barley, chickpeas, sorghum, winter and summer crops. And then we run some breeding cattle  
**[0:13:02-0:13:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:13:02):**  as well. On the country, we can't utilise in that system. It's a really tough situation.  We've actually unloaded all of our cattle and we have no crops on the ground and we're  really just waiting for the next season to come around and start again. That's so horrible.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:13:17):**  I think people who haven't been out to the regions that hear about drought and hear about  the season just don't really know what that's like, but it paints a bit of a picture for  them. It's pretty crazy. It's incredible. You look at how hard the taps turned off on  
**[0:13:32-0:13:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:13:32):**  the weather system and we've been on that farm for four generations and the 65 drought  was our benchmark and it's well past what that achieved. A lot drier and there's got  to be some end to it here. Sooner or later, we'll see a change in the weather.  
**[0:13:51-0:14:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:13:51):**  One thing that's hopefully positive that's come out of it is you getting started with  an ag tech startup. Tell us a little bit about that.  Yes, sir. Baby Farm Simple. Three, four years ago now, I had a young guy come and work for  
**[0:14:06-0:14:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:14:06):**  me. He's a software engineer and we were frustrated in just being able to communicate in many  jail farming operations together and other stuff. Matt said, I'll have a go at this and  convert all of those notes in your head and in your top pocket and get it into an app.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:14:26):**  That wasn't really just a fill-me-up basis. It was really how do we have some clear communication  and clear vision of what we're doing in our operations. That took a couple of years to  get my brand and play with on a hobby-type basis. When we came out the other side of  
**[0:14:42-0:15:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:14:42):**  that, we started talking with our local peer group of other farmers and farmers is all  done at home. I said we could use that and I just expanded from there to the stage where  we're now running out of serious concern and we're lucky to pick up the farmers to found  
**[0:15:02-0:15:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:15:02):**  us boot camp and really trying to push along.  I'm interested in the search for a solution because there are quite a few farm management  software products out there, but you felt like what existed just didn't meet the needs.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:15:19):**  Tell me a little bit about why you felt like even though there are products on the market,  nothing was really good enough.  Absolutely, Sarah. We've looked at other solutions and things that are available on the market.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:15:31):**  The key things we were really chasing that we saw were missing was one, was remote connection  irrespective of network coverage. Two was the simplicity of operations from an operator's  point of view. Then three was really starting to customise that data for getting efficiency  
**[0:15:50-0:16:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:15:50):**  in a business. A lot of those other softwares had been little silos looking after niche  parts of our operation and we were really trying to get a broad spectrum software base  that would look after everything from inputs to outputs to everything in between.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:16:07):**  One of the interesting things about the Farmers to Founders boot camp program is that because  the entrepreneurs are farmers, they've actually experienced the problem they're trying to  solve. But to build a business, you have to have more than just one customer. A big focus  
**[0:16:21-0:16:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:16:21):**  for the teams during the boot camp program is talking to other farmers about their challenges  and figuring out if the solutions that the teams have built will work in other farming  systems and other workflows. Lee shares one of these experiences.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:16:35):**  Absolutely. We had a customer who we've been talking with for a long time who had a really  big demand, big suite of things they were trying to chase for a large farming organisation.  In the last three, four months, they've come to us and said, look, we want that simplicity  
**[0:16:53-0:17:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:16:53):**  and we want that broad spectrum type data. They sat down with us and really fleshed out  a lot more of what they see they need for their business. We're trying to look at how  we align that with other customers to make sure that's a whole solution that everyone  
**[0:17:08-0:17:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:17:08):**  uses. That's been terrific because they're testing that database and giving feedback  on the use and how that's operating for them.  When you start those conversations with them, Lee, does it help that you are a farmer as  
**[0:17:23-0:17:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:17:23):**  well? Does that make it easier for them to answer your phone call or have a chat?  Absolutely. I suppose that's been the challenge a little bit for us. We're all engineers in  different strains and we love getting into the tech side of things. The best thing for  
**[0:17:40-0:17:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:17:40):**  us has been learning a little bit more about just sitting and listening to what their issues  are in their business and where they see they need to get sharper and get more efficient.  That's really starting to hone what we're looking at. We really got through and solved  
**[0:17:55-0:18:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:17:55):**  our own issue on our own farm. It was really like, what else is out there? What makes this  a complete solution that hits the majority of the market? That really made a difference  to just sit, listen and get them to unpack their issues.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:09):**  Good. Well, I'm glad our coaching has been useful for something. No, I'm just kidding.  Absolutely.  Anyways. Why did you join the Farmers to Founders bootcamp?  
**[0:18:21-0:18:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:21):**  Look, we were really right, as I just described. We knew our tech in that sense. We can pretty  well build anything in Appland. Give us time and lots of coffee. Our issue is always making  sure it's hitting the mark and understanding how that hits the mark with other farmers,  
**[0:18:42-0:18:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:42):**  other farming businesses. That's the real challenge is. Then how to get to them, how  to one, educate them, show them what we are, connect with what they need and make sure  that delivers value.  
**[0:18:53-0:19:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:53):**  They're the things I would have said, we as founders, it's not where we come from. It's  not what we're good at, marketing, understanding customers. This program really started to  open our eyes on how to get into that.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:19:08):**  What do you see as similarities or differences in being a farmer versus now being a founder  of a startup? Is it similar skill sets or really different? Which one is easier or harder?  Yeah. Look, they're both a challenge. Weather is a challenge at home, so I'm not going to  
**[0:19:25-0:19:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:19:25):**  underwrite what farming is right now. But farmers are terrific at normally solving their  own issue and get really good at that and they seem to hone in on their own issue and  really put them to bed. But being able to translate that to other farming businesses  
**[0:19:41-0:19:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:19:41):**  is always a tough thing.  I see the same in our software packages. This is a solution to how to get better information  in your farming business. We're very close to what our issue was, but it's that how do  
**[0:19:55-0:20:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:19:55):**  you unpack other people's problems and fit that into the package and make it service  multiple businesses and really start to get some efficiency in our business line in broadacre  farming.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:20:08):**  What's your vision for FarmSible? What do you hope you guys achieve, whether that's  in the near term as part of the boot camp or more long term?  Look, the long term is probably our vision. We want to see some efficiency changes in  
**[0:20:21-0:20:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:20:21):**  farming systems. Australia is a very tough climate to run a profitable business in broadacre  farming. In my generation, I've seen the evolutions of GPS and all of the efficiency gains that  Ag has gotten out of that. This next set of efficiency gains are a big suite of, a lot  
**[0:20:44-0:21:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:20:44):**  of it is information and technology tools. A lot of it's human data, a lot of it's machine  data and how that all comes together. I see a real vacuum in trying to get platforms that  will work across lots of those fields and connect lots of information and do really  
**[0:21:01-0:21:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:21:01):**  good analytics on it to provide numbers and direction for businesses as to what's next.  But that's where we want to play. That's where we want to be involved is how do we get Australian  Ag and then international Ag more efficient.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:21:18):**  That's Lee from FarmSible. Now you've met half the cohort. You'll get to meet the rest  of the producer-led teams in a future episode that will also be brought to you by Farmers  to Founders. The other teams are a bit different in that they are value adding what they produce  
**[0:21:33-0:21:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:21:33):**  on their farm rather than building a technology business. So stay tuned to meet those teams.  And again, if you haven't had a chance to check it out, please visit farmerstofounders.com  to learn more about producer-led innovation. Applications are open now for the Farmers  
**[0:21:49-0:22:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:21:49):**  to Founders ideas program. The ideas program is for producers who have an idea for a new  business or want to commercialize an invention. It gives them support and funding to get started  and the tools they need to decide if the idea is actually worth producing. So thanks to

### Agtech - So What?  (Tue, 07 Jan 2020 19:13:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:00:12):**  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:00:17):**  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:00:22):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:00:27):**  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  
**[0:00:31-0:00:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:00:31):**  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Welcome to 2020 Ag Tech So What, listeners.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:00:42):**  2019 was a big year for us at Agthentic, and for this podcast, we did 26 episodes with  
**[0:00:48-0:00:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:00:48):**  36 guests, ranging from farmers to researchers to investors and entrepreneurs. Thank you  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:00:55):**  for your support, and as always, if you like what you're hearing, please leave us a review  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:00:59):**  or share this podcast with a friend. This year, we'll be making a few changes like we  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:01:04):**  did last year. For example, you'll hear more from the rest of the Agthentic team, not just  
**[0:01:09-0:01:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:01:09):**  me, and we'll be adding more episodes within particular themes. So more on that soon. But  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:01:16):**  before we change too many things, today's episode is another look at what's happening  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:01:21):**  with the farmers to founders boot camp cohort. Just like you heard on episode 55 with Ash  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:01:27):**  at Training Paddock and David at Farm Service Manager, these are startups that are founded  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:01:32):**  by farmers. The whole idea behind farmers to founders is to put producers and their  
**[0:01:37-0:01:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:01:37):**  challenges at the center of innovation rather than the technologies. So today I chat with  
**[0:01:43-0:01:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:01:43):**  Fi from Bitwise Agronomy and Lee from Farm Simple. When I spoke with Fi, she was in Launceston,  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:01:50):**  Tasmania at a co-working space in a heritage building. She starts with her background and  
**[0:01:56-0:02:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:01:56):**  how she came to be in Tassie. So I live in Tasmania. I've got a vineyard called Jingles  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:02:04):**  Creek Vineyard. We've got a really teeny tiny vineyard. And I worked in technology up in  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:02:09):**  the mainland, in Sydney and Brisbane, and GIS in New Zealand. So we sort of moved down  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:02:14):**  to Tassie to be close to my husband's family and bought the love of wine and tech together  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:02:20):**  in Bitwise Agronomy. And yeah, that's sort of where we're at now.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:02:24):**  So good. So you're a Kiwi originally. You moved to Brisbane and were there working in  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:02:28):**  the tech industry. What did you do there in terms of technology?  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:02:31):**  Yes, I worked for a company called AECOM, which is a big civil engineering company.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:02:36):**  We set up a technology as a service team where we built custom products that we thought AECOM  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:02:42):**  needed and I also worked in the GIS world for a while in Sydney.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:02:47):**  Cool. So kind of geospatial stuff and some pretty advanced tech too, from what I understand,  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:02:52):**  some artificial intelligence and things like that. Is that right?  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:02:56):**  Yeah. We did some predictive analytics systems that we built where we put reformators and  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:02):**  cameras and stuff on cars and could collect all this data and put it into a sort of an  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:08):**  integrated visualization system to predict gravel road asset management. And we built  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:12):**  systems to help with sort of rapid disaster recovery, like floods and earthquakes where  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:17):**  we can take lots of images and put it up into the cloud and spit out reports and stuff to  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:21):**  make the teams a lot quicker and efficient.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:23):**  Wow. Cool. So then you moved to Tassie and you're on this vineyard. Was there a moment  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:28):**  when you said, oh, all that technology could be used in agriculture or how did you kind  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:32):**  of come up with the idea for Bitwise Agronomy?  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:34):**  Yeah. Look, I don't know whether the idea for the tech came first or the idea for the  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:38):**  vineyard came first. I think when I moved to Tassie, I was like, oh, I'm not sure what  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:43):**  the tech industry is like down here. And I thought, well, I'll buy a vineyard. And I  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:49):**  have always had a bit of a passion for ag tech coming from an ag background in New Zealand.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:53):**  And my uncle's really savvy and engineering savvy, I suppose, on his dairy farm. So I  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:03:59):**  always sort of thought, oh, there's really good stuff that could be done. So when I came  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:04:04):**  down here, I thought, if I don't work in tech, I want to work in wine. And then I think in  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:04:08):**  the back of my mind, there was always this, but I could have a startup around ag tech  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:04:13):**  and bringing efficiencies to farming.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:04:15):**  Very cool. And so tell us about Bitwise Agronomy. What do you actually do? What problem do you  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:04:19):**  solve and for whom? How does it work?  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:04:22):**  Yeah. So Bitwise Agronomy is myself and my co-founder, Aaron. And Aaron and I work together  
**[0:04:27-0:04:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:04:27):**  at AECOM. What we do is we basically want to give time back to farmers. So we've got  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:04:37):**  a product at the moment that we're working on called Green View. And if you can imagine  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:04:41):**  Street View for crops, and you take imagery, so like a GPS video of the vines, and we sprinkle  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:04:48):**  a bit of machine learning on top of that. And that allows farmers to look at the information  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:04:53):**  and look at the grapes back at home. And lots of vineyard owners have multiple sites and  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:04:59):**  a lot of vines. So they can really have eyes on the ground and view the grapes whenever  
**[0:05:03-0:05:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:03):**  they want from the comfort at their home and cut down the time driving and spending wasted  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:11):**  low value time getting between sites and things like that.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:14):**  Very cool. I love that you say, and then we just sprinkle a bit of machine learning as  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:17):**  if that's a thing that most people can just sprinkle. It sounds so casual to you, but  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:22):**  very impressive.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:23):**  Yes. It's a little bit like hundreds of thousands on the top.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:28):**  So you see this kind of being for the wine industry initially. Do you imagine it has  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:35):**  applications in other industries or you're pretty focused on wine?  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:38):**  It definitely has applications in other industries. We've kind of looked at building things like  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:42):**  this in the past for road street signs. You can do sort of asset management on those street  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:48):**  signs. But what we're focusing on first is, I suppose, linear crops and horticulture.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:53):**  And then we want to broaden to more general agriculture and then sort of our three to  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:05:57):**  five year goal is what other industries that haven't got a system like this could use this.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:03):**  And the fact that we use really affordable cameras, we really want to give machine learning  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:08):**  to everyone and to do machine learning as a service in an affordable way.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:14):**  So how do you think that having the vineyard and being a vineyard owner has impacted your  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:19):**  ability to build this agtech company? Does that really bring a lot of kind of on the  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:23):**  ground expertise and understanding of the problem or was it kind of things you already  
**[0:06:28-0:06:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:28):**  knew anyways?  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:29):**  No, I think it was crucial to having the startup and all the products that we've done in the  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:34):**  past for other companies and now with Bitwise Agronomy, the key factor is having the knowledge  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:39):**  of the problem that you're solving. And unless you're really immersed in that problem and  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:43):**  experiencing it firsthand, you might not get the technology right. And I think that's a  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:48):**  really important ingredient for success with technology. You don't want to do tech for  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:53):**  the sake of tech and by being on the ground in the vineyard and living through these problems.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:06:58):**  And when we first bought the vineyard, because we were such a tiny tiny vineyard, we were  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:07:03):**  doing everything manually and really understanding the pain points of everything that was going  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:07:08):**  on and where the time was wasting was. So I think it's given us a really good foundation  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:07:12):**  to be able to solve these problems. And I think that if you don't understand the problems,  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:07:18):**  then technology is just technology.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:07:22):**  Sophie does have a, as she says, teeny tiny vineyard. She has deep roots in the agriculture  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:07:28):**  industry and with rural communities. This has given her a passion for ag, as well as  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:07:33):**  a deeper understanding of what the users of Bitwise Agronomy are going through.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:07:38):**  I grew up in New Zealand and my dad's family's been farming forever down in, well, he grew  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:07:46):**  up in the Centro Atago region and then moved to the North Island. My auntie and uncle were  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:07:52):**  farming as well. So I grew up on a sheep and beef farm with a little bit of grain and my  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:07:56):**  auntie and uncle did various things. They had ended up with dairy, but they did deer  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:08:01):**  and grain as well and had a really, really large property, which is now my cousin's.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:08:07):**  And they've got quite a large dairy farm there. So yeah, I grew up in a rural environment.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:08:13):**  There was anywhere between 12 and, I don't know, 30 people at my primary school, my first  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:08:18):**  primary school, so we're a little tiny wee community. And yeah, I used to love going  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:08:24):**  to my uncle Stu's farm. He used to be doing really cool things with tinkering with his,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:08:30):**  automating his sheds and his all sorts of stuff. And he was always quite innovative.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:08:35):**  I think being exposed to that and from a rural ag sector in New Zealand, which I find is  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:08:44):**  maybe a little bit more advanced than Australia because, you know, I suppose the number one  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:08:49):**  industry there, so a little bit more investment happens in it. But, you know, I think that  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:08:53):**  really gave me my passion to come back to the country lifestyle.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:08:57):**  Even though Fi has a mix of ag and quite deep tech experience, starting a company is still  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:09:03):**  really hard and she constantly has to push herself out of her comfort zone.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:09:07):**  Oh, wow. It's been a rollercoaster, I suppose, like all startups and small businesses as  
**[0:09:12-0:09:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:09:12):**  well. For me, the tech and the building of the tech has been the easy side of things  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:09:19):**  and bringing the team together because that's what I sort of naturally do in the past in  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:09:23):**  my day job. I think for me, one of the hard things is getting out there in front of people,  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:09:29):**  telling them what we've got, engaging in the whole like sales process and clients because  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:09:35):**  I've always sort of been of the nature that I just really want to help people. So I've  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:09:39):**  got a tendency just to give everything away for free. Oh, you just use it, you know, this  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:09:44):**  really helps you. I don't care kind of thing. So to really structure a business around it  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:09:48):**  and, you know, realize that talking to investors and things like that aren't as scary as what  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:09:54):**  it seems to be. And I think the other thing is that being in a rural setting, you don't  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:10:00):**  really have access to a network of other startups and I suppose groups that come together like  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:10:07):**  you have in your startup hubs in Sydney and Brisbane and Melbourne. There's a small community  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:10:11):**  down here in Taz but, you know, it can feel quite lonely and isolating and it's quite  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:10:16):**  hard to find those kind of mentors and stuff. So that's why being on Farmers to Founders  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:10:20):**  has been great for us. So that's definitely one reason. Any other reasons why you joined  
**[0:10:25-0:10:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:10:25):**  Farmers to Founders bootcamp? Oh, there's so many. To have the push and to be challenged  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:10:33):**  so I meet my own timeframes. Otherwise you can kind of get caught up with, you know,  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:10:39):**  other life stuff. So, and yeah, just to have that community and access to mentors and,  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:10:46):**  you know, talk to other people in the industries like the four day intensive that we had in  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:10:50):**  Sydney was great, you know, talking to the other startups and, you know, successful startups  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:10:55):**  now and hearing their journeys and, you know, just that energy that you get from being in  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:10:59):**  the group just, you know, makes you want to do better and do it faster. Awesome. Tell  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:11:04):**  me a little bit about, Fi, your vision for the future of Bitwise Agronomy. What do you  
**[0:11:09-0:11:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:11:09):**  hope that this company achieves? Yeah, so I'm really passionate about technology, about  
**[0:11:16-0:11:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:11:16):**  ag and also about rural Australia. So what I really want to do is build a great technology  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:11:23):**  company out of Tasmania, bring really good skills down to Tasmania and give people opportunity  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:11:28):**  to have the great lifestyle that Tasmania offers, but also be able to work on really  
**[0:11:32-0:11:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:11:32):**  cool technology and cool solutions and, you know, have the best of both worlds and build  
**[0:11:39-0:11:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:11:39):**  the community down here. Tasmania is a cool island that's great for prototyping for, you  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:11:46):**  know, sort of global businesses and I really want to help bring that to Tasmania. So that  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:11:52):**  is Fi, co-founder of Bitwise Agronomy. The link to the website is in the show notes,  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:11:57):**  so definitely check it out. As I said on the David and Ash episode, we'll be bringing you  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:12:01):**  an update on where all of these teams get to over the course of the three-month Farmers  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:12:05):**  to Founders Bootcamp. Maybe you'll even get to hear them pitch. Next up is Lee from Farm  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:12:11):**  Simple. I caught Lee while he was on holiday in Palm Beach, so his audio is a bit rough  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:12:16):**  because I didn't want to disturb him too much, so thanks for understanding. Lee starts by  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:12:22):**  talking about his farm. Our farm is based in northern New South Wales near Moree, so  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:12:27):**  about four hours in land from the coast, five hours in land from the coast. We've had an  
**[0:12:32-0:12:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:12:32):**  exceptionally dry A in more than almost two years and we're looking for the seasons to  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:12:39):**  change and get back to some sort of normality. And what do you guys normally farm? What's  
**[0:12:44-0:12:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:12:44):**  a normal season like? Yep, so we call ourselves a mixed farm, but we're predominantly cropping,  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:12:51):**  so we have about 3,000 hectares of country. 72% of it's arable, so that's a mix of wheat,  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:12:58):**  barley, chickpeas, sorghum, winter and summer crops. And then we run some breeding cattle  
**[0:13:02-0:13:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:13:02):**  as well. On the country, we can't utilise in that system. It's a really tough situation.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:13:09):**  We've actually unloaded all of our cattle and we have no crops on the ground and we're  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:13:13):**  really just waiting for the next season to come around and start again. That's so horrible.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:13:17):**  I think people who haven't been out to the regions that hear about drought and hear about  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:13:22):**  the season just don't really know what that's like, but it paints a bit of a picture for  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:13:26):**  them. It's pretty crazy. It's incredible. You look at how hard the taps turned off on  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:13:32):**  the weather system and we've been on that farm for four generations and the 65 drought  
**[0:13:37-0:13:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:13:37):**  was our benchmark and it's well past what that achieved. A lot drier and there's got  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:13:45):**  to be some end to it here. Sooner or later, we'll see a change in the weather.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:13:51):**  One thing that's hopefully positive that's come out of it is you getting started with  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:13:55):**  an ag tech startup. Tell us a little bit about that.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:13:59):**  Yes, sir. Baby Farm Simple. Three, four years ago now, I had a young guy come and work for  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:14:06):**  me. He's a software engineer and we were frustrated in just being able to communicate in many  
**[0:14:12-0:14:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:14:12):**  jail farming operations together and other stuff. Matt said, I'll have a go at this and  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:14:20):**  convert all of those notes in your head and in your top pocket and get it into an app.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:14:26):**  That wasn't really just a fill-me-up basis. It was really how do we have some clear communication  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:14:31):**  and clear vision of what we're doing in our operations. That took a couple of years to  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:14:37):**  get my brand and play with on a hobby-type basis. When we came out the other side of  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:14:42):**  that, we started talking with our local peer group of other farmers and farmers is all  
**[0:14:47-0:14:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:14:47):**  done at home. I said we could use that and I just expanded from there to the stage where  
**[0:14:55-0:15:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:14:55):**  we're now running out of serious concern and we're lucky to pick up the farmers to found  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:15:02):**  us boot camp and really trying to push along.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:15:06):**  I'm interested in the search for a solution because there are quite a few farm management  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:15:14):**  software products out there, but you felt like what existed just didn't meet the needs.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:15:19):**  Tell me a little bit about why you felt like even though there are products on the market,  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:15:23):**  nothing was really good enough.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:15:25):**  Absolutely, Sarah. We've looked at other solutions and things that are available on the market.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:15:31):**  The key things we were really chasing that we saw were missing was one, was remote connection  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:15:37):**  irrespective of network coverage. Two was the simplicity of operations from an operator's  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:15:43):**  point of view. Then three was really starting to customise that data for getting efficiency  
**[0:15:50-0:15:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:15:50):**  in a business. A lot of those other softwares had been little silos looking after niche  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:15:57):**  parts of our operation and we were really trying to get a broad spectrum software base  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:16:01):**  that would look after everything from inputs to outputs to everything in between.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:16:07):**  One of the interesting things about the Farmers to Founders boot camp program is that because  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:16:11):**  the entrepreneurs are farmers, they've actually experienced the problem they're trying to  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:16:15):**  solve. But to build a business, you have to have more than just one customer. A big focus  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:16:21):**  for the teams during the boot camp program is talking to other farmers about their challenges  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:16:26):**  and figuring out if the solutions that the teams have built will work in other farming  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:16:31):**  systems and other workflows. Lee shares one of these experiences.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:16:35):**  Absolutely. We had a customer who we've been talking with for a long time who had a really  
**[0:16:41-0:16:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:16:41):**  big demand, big suite of things they were trying to chase for a large farming organisation.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:16:48):**  In the last three, four months, they've come to us and said, look, we want that simplicity  
**[0:16:53-0:17:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:16:53):**  and we want that broad spectrum type data. They sat down with us and really fleshed out  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:17:00):**  a lot more of what they see they need for their business. We're trying to look at how  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:17:04):**  we align that with other customers to make sure that's a whole solution that everyone  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:17:08):**  uses. That's been terrific because they're testing that database and giving feedback  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:17:13):**  on the use and how that's operating for them.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:17:19):**  When you start those conversations with them, Lee, does it help that you are a farmer as  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:17:23):**  well? Does that make it easier for them to answer your phone call or have a chat?  
**[0:17:27-0:17:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:17:27):**  Absolutely. I suppose that's been the challenge a little bit for us. We're all engineers in  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:17:34):**  different strains and we love getting into the tech side of things. The best thing for  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:17:40):**  us has been learning a little bit more about just sitting and listening to what their issues  
**[0:17:44-0:17:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:17:44):**  are in their business and where they see they need to get sharper and get more efficient.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:17:51):**  That's really starting to hone what we're looking at. We really got through and solved  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:17:55):**  our own issue on our own farm. It was really like, what else is out there? What makes this  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:00):**  a complete solution that hits the majority of the market? That really made a difference  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:05):**  to just sit, listen and get them to unpack their issues.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:09):**  Good. Well, I'm glad our coaching has been useful for something. No, I'm just kidding.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:16):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:17):**  Anyways. Why did you join the Farmers to Founders bootcamp?  
**[0:18:21-0:18:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:21):**  Look, we were really right, as I just described. We knew our tech in that sense. We can pretty  
**[0:18:30-0:18:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:30):**  well build anything in Appland. Give us time and lots of coffee. Our issue is always making  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:37):**  sure it's hitting the mark and understanding how that hits the mark with other farmers,  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:42):**  other farming businesses. That's the real challenge is. Then how to get to them, how  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:48):**  to one, educate them, show them what we are, connect with what they need and make sure  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:52):**  that delivers value.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:53):**  They're the things I would have said, we as founders, it's not where we come from. It's  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:18:58):**  not what we're good at, marketing, understanding customers. This program really started to  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:19:04):**  open our eyes on how to get into that.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:19:08):**  What do you see as similarities or differences in being a farmer versus now being a founder  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:19:13):**  of a startup? Is it similar skill sets or really different? Which one is easier or harder?  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:19:20):**  Yeah. Look, they're both a challenge. Weather is a challenge at home, so I'm not going to  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:19:25):**  underwrite what farming is right now. But farmers are terrific at normally solving their  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:19:30):**  own issue and get really good at that and they seem to hone in on their own issue and  
**[0:19:34-0:19:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:19:34):**  really put them to bed. But being able to translate that to other farming businesses  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:19:41):**  is always a tough thing.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:19:42):**  I see the same in our software packages. This is a solution to how to get better information  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:19:49):**  in your farming business. We're very close to what our issue was, but it's that how do  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:19:55):**  you unpack other people's problems and fit that into the package and make it service  
**[0:20:00-0:20:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:20:00):**  multiple businesses and really start to get some efficiency in our business line in broadacre  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:20:07):**  farming.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:20:08):**  What's your vision for FarmSible? What do you hope you guys achieve, whether that's  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:20:12):**  in the near term as part of the boot camp or more long term?  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:20:15):**  Look, the long term is probably our vision. We want to see some efficiency changes in  
**[0:20:21-0:20:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:20:21):**  farming systems. Australia is a very tough climate to run a profitable business in broadacre  
**[0:20:29-0:20:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:20:29):**  farming. In my generation, I've seen the evolutions of GPS and all of the efficiency gains that  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:20:37):**  Ag has gotten out of that. This next set of efficiency gains are a big suite of, a lot  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:20:44):**  of it is information and technology tools. A lot of it's human data, a lot of it's machine  
**[0:20:48-0:20:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:20:48):**  data and how that all comes together. I see a real vacuum in trying to get platforms that  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:20:56):**  will work across lots of those fields and connect lots of information and do really  
**[0:21:01-0:21:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:21:01):**  good analytics on it to provide numbers and direction for businesses as to what's next.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:21:09):**  But that's where we want to play. That's where we want to be involved is how do we get Australian  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:21:14):**  Ag and then international Ag more efficient.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:21:18):**  That's Lee from FarmSible. Now you've met half the cohort. You'll get to meet the rest  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:21:23):**  of the producer-led teams in a future episode that will also be brought to you by Farmers  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:21:28):**  to Founders. The other teams are a bit different in that they are value adding what they produce  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:21:33):**  on their farm rather than building a technology business. So stay tuned to meet those teams.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:21:39):**  And again, if you haven't had a chance to check it out, please visit farmerstofounders.com

**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=543815#t=0:22:01):**  and the tools they need to decide if the idea is actually worth producing. So thanks to

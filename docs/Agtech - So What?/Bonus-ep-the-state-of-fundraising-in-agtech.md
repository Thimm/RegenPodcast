### Agtech - So What?  (2022-03-30)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to a very special bonus episode of AgTech So What.  I'm Sarah Nalet, your host, but today I'm also going to be wearing another hat.  As most listeners probably already know, in addition to hosting this lovely podcast, I'm  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:16):**  also a general partner at Tenacious Ventures alongside my co-founder, Matthew Pryor, who  will, in the spirit of new hats, be co-hosting with me today.  Hey, Matthew.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:25):**  Hey, Sarah.  Thanks for the intro.  Hey, everyone.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:28):**  Over the years, we've had a ton of fascinating conversations on this podcast with experts  from farmers to founders to investors, and that has served as a kind of loose record  of how shifts in the world have led to shifts in AgTech in general and AgTech investing  
**[0:00:44-0:00:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:44):**  in particular.  At the same time, behind the scenes, we've been building and revising our own thinking  in light of current events.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:51):**  We thought it'd be interesting to highlight some of those insights on the state of AgTech  investing, where it's been, where it's going, and what we think is the most interesting  about where it is today in 2022.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:03):**  But before we dive in, I want to say that this episode is definitely not investment  advice.  And for full transparency, we at Tenacious Ventures are investors in a couple of the  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:12):**  companies you'll hear from, including Go Terra, Nowadays, and Cecil.  So to start off this conversation, we asked a group of founders and investors some questions  around their fundraising and investing over the last couple of years, including COVID,  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:25):**  massive climate shifts, changing economic and social conditions, and more.  You'll hear their responses throughout the episode, starting with Matthew reflecting  back on the many months since March 2020 when COVID hit and we at Tenacious Ventures first  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:39):**  started investing.  It's the opposite of the kind of frog in the water scenario.  This just feels like the way it's always been to us in terms of we were born literally in  
**[0:01:50-0:01:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:50):**  the teeth of COVID as an investor.  So I think that leveling the idea that geography matters so much less, the idea that all of  a sudden the complexity and fragility of supply chain started to become really apparent.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:04):**  I think those are all the reflections, but in some way it felt like we were looking at  it from the inside rather than from the outside.  And I think that's interesting.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:13):**  And to get the different perspectives of that, both from the kind of founders, how it's opened  up new opportunities for them, but also for investors, how it's actually quite changed  both their relationship to where they might invest in who, but also how investors relate  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:26):**  to each other.  I think there's just so much that's interesting there that in reality has actually happened  over a pretty short period of time.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:31):**  Do you want to tell that story when you say we were born right on the cusp of it?  Like there's a couple of tidbits there that people might not know?  I believe the date of our first close still holds the record for the largest single day  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:44):**  drop on the Australian securities exchange.  It was pretty interesting as first time managers.  I guess we didn't really have that much of a thought about the kind of macro trends as  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:56):**  they relate to us actually getting money transferred into our bank account.  But as we were witnessing the carnage on the public markets, cast a couple of thoughts  as to where all the money would actually appear in the bank account on the day.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:09):**  But of course everything went swimmingly and all of our fantastic LPs are long-term investors  and we've been busy since then.  Yes.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:18):**  Yeah, that was definitely a change over the course of us raising is we had talked to people  in like August, September, October, 2019.  And then by the time we actually did our first capital call and final close, it was March  
**[0:03:28-0:03:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:28):**  2020.  And so it was like a pretty different world we lived in when we first started calling  capital and making investments.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:34):**  So we've been on this journey as well.  And obviously COVID is one thing that's changed and the fall on effects of that in terms of  supply chains, macroeconomic conditions, people's reflections on their time and how they're  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:45):**  spending it as they've sat at home and thought differently about career and passion.  I think it's a great time for food and ag, but it's had some both positive and negative  impacts on entrepreneurs for sure.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:56):**  So one of the big things that's changed, and I noticed this because I spent five months  in the US in 2021 was just the absolute influx of climate focused investors.  And that's both existing funds, attracting institutional investors who have ESG or other  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:12):**  types of climate or impact reporting requirements, as well as people seeing the opportunity to  do something about climate change and technology's role in that.  And again, that's also had positive and negative impacts in terms of their knowledge of climate  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:26):**  and the requirements to do stuff with different technologies than software and how that plays  out in food and ag and complexity of value chains.  So again, positives and negatives, but that was one that shocked me as everyone I talked  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:37):**  to in the States is raising a climate fund, talking about a climate fund, having climate  pressures on their funds.  So maybe that's just the bubble that I live in, but I think that's definitely different  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:46):**  than it was previously.  Actually, I think that's another, that's a good kind of prompt there in terms of things  that have changed significantly is the dramatic reversal of globalization that we've all just  
**[0:04:58-0:05:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:58):**  cropped already, like this whole idea of sovereign capability and just in time, we've all just  absorbed a different world and don't fully recognize how fundamentally value chains and  supply chains, especially ones that were multi-step international.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:05:16):**  I would say every day that we have conversations with founders in hardware businesses, they  always mention the fact that there are still massive delays in parts and particularly in  electronics, but we've just, I don't know, it feels like we just have moved on from that.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:05:32):**  And yet it really is such a dramatic difference.  And we talk about just in case now in terms of rather than just in time and things like  that.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:05:40):**  So I think there has been a pretty significant replumbing of global supply chains that we've  largely accepted now.  Amidst these seismic shifts and challenges to decades old business models, founders have  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:05:53):**  been in some ways rethinking what's most important in the fundraising process as they navigate  a world of capital that's changing incredibly fast.  We asked Jasmine Hume, CEO and founder of the US-based alternative protein company,  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:06:07):**  Shiru, what the experience of raising over the last two years was like for her.  The experience we had was completely different where investors coming from a lot of different  backgrounds and having a portfolio theses across a couple of different sectors, not  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:06:21):**  even only in food and ag, were really, I would say, clamoring to get into the most competitive  rounds and really very eerily trying to allocate their capital to some of these companies,  especially in our field, like alternative proteins and food technology.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:06:38):**  I think that COVID has had a big impact there for sure.  It's brought to light a lot of major issues, particularly as it relates to our food supply  chain considering the products that traditionally come from animals like meat and milk and the  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:06:50):**  struggles that we've had in being able to keep up production in a stable way over the  course of the pandemic.  So definitely the influx of investors that we've had and we've gotten to know recently  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:03):**  over the last year, this year, have been very excited to focus more of their capital on  companies that are really addressing issues concerning the climate.  Yeah, I've seen this climate focus play out in a couple ways.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:16):**  One it's made sectors like alternative protein, given the kind of hype that's been around  it and some of the exits and large raises we've seen in this space look attractive to  investors.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:26):**  It's also maybe caused some hesitation as we've seen share prices fall and performance  maybe not be what people thought it would be.  And there's this dynamic in alternative protein, especially where I think there's this musical  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:38):**  chairs game going and everyone wants an alternative protein investment, but then once you have  one, are you going to make another one?  And so there's investors who've really done the work to understand this space and might  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:47):**  have multiple investments and some who it seems a little bit are like, Oh, the stats  around substituting out meat are compelling.  And so from a climate perspective, this is an easy place to be investing and look, there's  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:58):**  a track record of exits here.  So unpacking a little bit of what the drivers are for funding in alternative protein, specifically  as it relates to climate, you get a couple of different nuances there.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:08):**  Yeah, I think maybe another dimension there that does relate to animal agriculture is  that the pandemic did show us how susceptible animal agriculture is to human input in the  supply chain, particularly in the kind of processing we saw massive disruptions in the  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:29):**  processing.  And so I think that's an interesting point there in terms of what specific industries  the pandemic had an impact on and it has and will continue to accelerate some things.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:41):**  I think that we already have seen, we'll continue to see significant automation, for example,  in processing in animal agriculture.  Like it's the other, that idea of that direct connection that we always really struggle  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:52):**  about with where food comes from and its relationship to climate and susceptibility.  When you walk down a supermarket aisle and there is literally nothing in it, I think  it's a little easier for the majority of people to sort of understand why we need to pay more  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:09):**  attention to where food comes from and how susceptible our food system is to shocks of  all kinds.  One of the things I hope does not go back to a similar level as before COVID is how  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:20):**  much people are focused on investing in climate.  That's definitely been a positive for the world that we need capital deployed in this  space and that we need people understanding it and thinking about it and investing in  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:29):**  entrepreneurs in this space.  My concern is that climate tech is not easy and it's not always just software as a service  with tried and true business models.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:39):**  There's some complexity here.  We always talk about you can't eat software.  And so in food and ag, we need tangible things.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:46):**  We need to think about hardware and robotics.  That's definitely one of my concerns is how much this climate tech capital will stick  around.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:52):**  And I know that's a concern that Olympia at Olivia Yager, founder and CEO of Gotara definitely  has.  There's a lot of interest in climate tech and there's a lot of funds that are looking  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:10:03):**  at this space and wanting to deploy funds into the space.  The challenges that we're seeing are that at this time, there's still not great structure  or patterns developed around how to assess and or strategically address how these new  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:10:23):**  innovations that include hardware fit into a venture capital model.  And so there is this sort of sense that every now and again, you're around peg square hole  because we're still using old venture models that are designed for SAS to assess hardware  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:10:36):**  companies.  Yeah, that's something we have set out to do.  Matthew, what have your reflections been on how hard or easy it's been to assess hardware  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:10:47):**  businesses and have a portfolio that includes deep tech and software?  This always reminds me of a film quote, which hopefully Olivia will appreciate.  Django Unchained, where they first get together and Django's acting really weird.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:01):**  And he's, I can't remember the other actor's name, but he says to him, what are you doing?  And Django says, I'm getting dirty.  And that's the thing.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:08):**  When you want to get stuff done, real stuff done in climate and in ag, you got to get  dirty.  You've got to get your hands dirty.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:15):**  You've got to get involved in the real world.  And I think that's the struggle that a lot of founders have.  And I think at that intersection of climate tech and ag tech to make real progress, to  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:26):**  have real impact, you can't just move bits around.  You got to get into atoms and molecules and those things add significant levels of complexity.  So I think that it's great in a way where we've got focused funds who can spend the  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:43):**  time to really understand and win climate tech, which obviously isn't much broader and  still gets pretty real in terms of other parts of the real world that need decarbonization.  But I think that's the exciting part in a way is to have funds who are focused and will  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:00):**  do the work to really understand why problems need to be solved a particular way.  So when you look at a company like Go Terra, where there's all of that complexity across  digital and electronic and biological, that there are people there who really can understand  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:13):**  why you're doing things that particular way.  I'm imagining potential investors listening to this going, yeah, but like, are you going  to make any money?  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:23):**  Cause it's capex intensive and their stuff's going to get stuck in supply chains.  And how do you diligence it?  Cause they don't have revenue because it took so long to build this product.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:32):**  What's your response to why we need to be doing this and how to make money doing it?  My initial response is because eventually the seagulls will take over and will cease  existing on the planet.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:44):**  These are really big and very important problems and managing post-consumer waste is a very  large problem.  And so, yeah, kind of goes back to the hard things, right?  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:57):**  You have to do hard things to solve these problems and it will require more patience,  but we talk about venture scale, like what could be more venture scale than something  that impacts every person on the planet.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:12):**  So I'm not worried about it from a returns point of view.  It may be that we will be required to be more patient than an average investor, but everything  that we're touching touches every person on the planet.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:25):**  So the scale is definitely there and these problems we can see every day are big and  important and must be solved.  One of the things I've been thinking about a lot is like how boring it would be to only  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:36):**  look at software companies and there's three different business models and they all are  doing the same things.  And yes, there's an argument for the absolute brilliance that has had in terms of transforming  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:46):**  our world and software eating the world and all of those things.  And yet the complexity is truly what we need to embrace to solve giant challenges.  I think it's Kara Swisher that said somewhat recently around like, we've had a lot of unicorns  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:59):**  and billion dollar companies, but what's the first trillion dollar company going to be?  It's going to be a climate tech startup.  And I couldn't be more in alignment with that.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:06):**  Like the problems are so big and those are going to require either complex business models  or complex technology.  So one of the things we've been spending time on is how do you assess and evaluate those  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:17):**  companies to Olympia's point?  Like it's not an apples to apples comparison.  So two things that come to mind that we do differently is spend time on the business  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:27):**  model, how they will actually get the technology into the hands of the users.  And in software, again, there's only a couple of different business models, but in the hardware  space or in different deep tech areas, really thinking about who's using the technology,  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:39):**  who's going to benefit, how does it fit into the existing supply chain?  How are we going to get it to scale?  Who's going to service it?  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:45):**  What are the costs of maintenance over the longterm?  Those are things we really need to appreciate and understand.  And then the other one is how do we think about the founder and the capital intensity  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:54):**  of the business model and how they're going to be able to manage that complexity and communicate  it to downstream investors, because it's one thing for us to believe that this is needed  and another for them to be able to get other investors on board.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:15:07):**  And so those are two things we end up thinking a lot about.  Yeah.  I think that to what Olympia was talking about there in terms of kind of understanding, even  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:15:18):**  if it weren't hardware in a climate tech or an ag tech sense, there are similar levels  of complexity in a lot of the other systems that have to be transformed.  And there are clearly a very sophisticated investors with well-formed thesis.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:15:33):**  I think kind of Olympia's point there is really about a match.  And so it may be that the investor hasn't necessarily looked at something like your  business in particular, but I think testing out how comfortable they are with the realities  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:15:50):**  of there needing to be multiple elements, that there will be a level of capital complexity  as a founder, having those conversations, understanding where those investors sit in  terms of that kind of reality, previous experience with the kind of point at which capital stops  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:07):**  being put into infrastructure and starts being put into scalable growth.  Those are super important because if you're the person who is educating the investor on  that stuff, it's going to take a pretty long time and probably longer than you've got for  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:20):**  your current raise.  That qualifying investor point is so important.  And even there's investors given this influx of climate money who think that they want  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:28):**  to do these deep tech companies.  And I know I've had conversations where it's like, great.  So you say that you are comfortable with this area.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:34):**  I don't see any companies in your portfolio that realize that.  And they're like, oh yeah, yeah, we really want to.  And then I talk through some of the companies in our portfolio and others that I know that  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:42):**  might be raising and offer intros or connections.  And inevitably most of them come back saying, oh yeah, that's just not really a fit for  us.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:49):**  Oh, it looks a bit complicated or it looks a bit complex.  So I think there's like an attention for investors who have just been trained to look at different  kinds of businesses and the kind of upskilling of the sector as investors that will need  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:17:01):**  to be able to make this jump in and look at these kinds of companies.  This conversation makes me think about something that Alex Logan, one of the co-founders of  Cecil said about how his thinking has evolved around engaging with potential investors,  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:17:14):**  specifically how it was critical to ensure that what an investor believes truly aligns  with what they say.  And that first meeting is probably going to go really well because you're not just going  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:17:25):**  to talk about this amazing journey that you've been on as a founder to starting this business,  but you're also going to be telling an amazing story about this new category or this new  opportunity that has emerged to contribute to climate solutions around the world.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:17:43):**  And although these initial engagements, responses and first meetings can be really great for  the ego, if you're getting to that third meeting and you don't believe that the people on the  other side of the table have a strong thesis and you're still educating them on what the  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:18:02):**  opportunity is and why now, then this could be viewed as a potential red flag.  And what you're actually looking for in that relationship build phase is someone who's  going to be riffing with you as to what that future is going to look like.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:18:18):**  And you need to believe that they have a strong thesis as to where the world is going.  The good news is that these funds do exist.  They've been out in the market raising capital through LPs for the last two to three years.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:18:34):**  And to do that, they've had to have a strong thesis.  And now they're in the market deploying capital.  I think that's a fascinating piece from Alex there because he's talking about the near-term  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:18:47):**  nature of a relationship that you're building with an investor.  And yet at the same time, talking about something that's a really long-term view.  And I think that's something that we find a lot with founders.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:00):**  I think that my first reaction is that there are those two time horizons with building  relationships with investors.  The first is knowing whether or not they're an investor for this round.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:10):**  That's super important.  And so Alex is getting to that in terms of the red flag could be never going to be an  investor or the red flag could be just not this round.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:19):**  And that's super important to know, obviously, in terms of your planning for a round.  I think the second part is what he said about the riffing.  That's super important also because as an early stage founder, you're really helping  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:31):**  an investor suspend disbelief.  It's not like there's evidence.  We talked about SaaS and SaaS metrics and all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:39):**  Companies, particularly companies working in these fields, you're early, you don't have  traditional traction and traditional metrics.  And so helping an investor kind of see what you see, believe what you believe is so much  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:53):**  easier if they believe something similar and you can translate their belief for one of  multiple hypotheses they might have into the version of the future that you see.  And so I think that's super important too.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:03):**  How do you build confidence that this isn't just something that you're never going to  get them over the line on because they want to see hard evidence for someone who's new  to an area.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:13):**  It's difficult to build belief because you don't have hypotheses to kind of hang those  beliefs around.  And I think that's what Alex is kind of talking about there is how do you recognize when you're  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:23):**  talking to someone who has already formed hypotheses in your area and what can you give  them to align the version of the future that you see with one that they're prepared to  back?  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:35):**  I really like what he was saying about qualifying questions because it's kind of where the rubber  meets the road on what you're saying there, Matthew.  So asking about what thesis did you pitch your LPs on or how did you raise your money?  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:48):**  And I think founders sometimes feel like they've got to be on stage pitching to investors or  like talking the whole time.  I know I really appreciate it when founders ask us about our journey as fund managers  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:59):**  and who our investors are and what thesis is we've developed and do we form thesis ahead  of time?  Have we looked at the space they're in?  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:07):**  How do we think about it?  So there's lots of qualifying questions.  The one that I really like when founders do is asking us to share back our view of the  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:15):**  space that they're in, especially after we've had a meeting because it's such a good way  for them to qualify.  Do we actually know what we're talking about here?  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:21):**  Have we thought deeply about what part of alternative protein we want to invest in or  what are the unlock codes in waste or what's going to matter in nature based solutions  as the market scales up and there's more supply and these kinds of things.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:33):**  So that for founders not being afraid to really push investors to qualify them and having  some of those like practical specific questions to ask and make sure it's going to be a good  fit for a long-term partnership.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:44):**  Yeah, actually I like that as a link between what Olympia was talking about and what Alex  is talking about just in terms of how do you dig into how well the conversation is going  in terms of actually it's about something that we're both comfortable with or we can  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:02):**  both get comfortable with, you know, whether that's hardware and an investor might say,  yeah, we're okay with hardware.  Okay, but how do you think about investing in infrastructure?  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:13):**  What experience have you had combining debt financing with venture financing as a hardware  based startup scales?  I think getting to details there will be really important part of building that confidence  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:26):**  that this isn't first time for everybody because that's going to be slow going most likely.  I want to play another quote from Olympia at Go Terra here, which I think is super relevant  for founders tactically to this whole conversation about vetting and getting comfortable with  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:41):**  potential investors.  I think every round I forget that the game is geared for the founder to be a fundraiser,  not a CEO.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:52):**  And when I say I forget that, what I mean is it doesn't seem to matter how often I try  to start the round early.  It's never really early enough for the get to know you period.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:23:04):**  And I'm a fairly hands on founder.  And so I've spent most of my time trying to work in the business being a founder.  And the reality is that the way the architecture and the ecosystem works for VC at the moment,  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:23:17):**  the CEO needs to spend more than half of their time actively working with investors to get  them to know you to build relationships and understand your business.  This is one that is absolutely true and it's one of those tropes of VC and startup is like  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:23:35):**  your job as a founder is to be fundraising.  And I think people say that and hear that and don't realize how true it is.  And yet it's not just about show me the money, I'm pitching all the time.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:23:46):**  I'm this like on stage doing the dance.  It's actually about building those relationships and doing that work because it takes a long  time to qualify an investor and it takes a long time to figure out if they're going to  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:23:55):**  be able to add value.  And that's work that startups definitely want to be doing to find the right fit for someone  who's going to go on the journey long-term.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:24:02):**  It does take time and it does take effort and it does take a bit of a mindset shift  to be focused on spending the time to build, manage and qualify those relationships and  partners.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:24:14):**  Maybe also though, it's a framing question.  I think the one thought I had listening to that again from Olympia was, but it's also  true of early customers.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:24:27):**  And whilst yes, technically pitching to an investor is different to developing an important  early business relationship, the quality that's the same is your ability as a founder to sell  a vision, which is partly deliverable today.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:24:46):**  And I think that's the ongoing challenge of an early stage founder is how far in front  of the curve you have to sell and sometimes with investors, it's a little bit further  out because you literally are talking about stuff that maybe won't even be true in two  
**[0:25:01-0:25:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:25:01):**  years time.  With customers, you're building expectations and it's more concrete in terms of what you  deliver, probably a little nearer term in terms of when the rubber is going to meet  
**[0:25:10-0:25:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:25:10):**  the road.  But I don't know, I don't feel like there's a bigger gap between what you would be doing  as a founder in terms of that visionary selling to early customers and really building confidence  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:25:24):**  in investors that they're the right investor for you and that they build that belief.  I think you're right.  One of the nuances here is not like whether founders know they're meant to fundraise or  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:25:34):**  how much do they want to raise venture capital.  It's actually the different part of your brain that you need to engage to message customers,  which is really setting expectations and managing the here's where my product's actually up  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:25:46):**  to.  Here's what we can do together and this is going to be new and scary and hard, but it's  world changing and here's the importance of it.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:25:52):**  And here's the realities of where our roadmap is today, but also where it's going to go  in the future versus the mindset of talking to investors, which is much more like, what  could this future look like?  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:02):**  How big is it?  How far are we going to get?  So it actually relates back to the marketing and ag tech episode around these different  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:08):**  audiences that you need to be talking to and how you translate what is still authentic  and truth to the way different people want to hear it and the kinds of frameworks they're  bringing to the conversation.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:19):**  And I think it was actionable advice, that recognition that you're actually taking people  on a journey.  And so don't tell them everything all at once, except I understand that it's a journey.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:30):**  You'll get them to the next level and then to be able to have the next answer is really  important.  Okay.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:36):**  Once you've built that understanding of why this is important, okay, now you've got that.  That's why we've done it this way, because once you get here, you'll understand that  your next two steps require this.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:47):**  So yeah, I think that's a good point.  One of the things that this conversation makes me think of around companies raising money,  and if you're always raising how much is too much is more always better.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:55):**  And that's something founders have to think about if they are always having these conversations  with investors, especially in really exciting spaces.  That's something that Max Elder, who's the CEO and co-founder at Nowadays had some thoughts  
**[0:27:05-0:27:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:27:05):**  on.  I think what's happening is there's some negative externalities to this kind of influx of capital  across the board and the doubling of venture money globally.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:27:16):**  One is that companies are just raising more money than they should be and more money than  they need to.  And they're able to do that because they're able to go out and find investors.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:27:25):**  In fact, investors who may not actually be experts in alternative proteins or even food,  a lot of tech investors are starting to invest in this space and founders are going out and  raising on insane valuations.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:27:39):**  Those really high valuations mean that they can raise a lot more capital without getting  too diluted.  They're raising a lot more money than they need to, and then they're throwing money at  
**[0:27:49-0:27:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:27:49):**  problems.  They're able to move faster.  They're able to buy their way into distribution.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:27:54):**  They're able to basically create dynamics where it's harder for other startups who are  scaling more responsibly and sustainably, raising the right amount of capital at the  right time to be able to compete.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:28:05):**  And to be honest, we've had funds pass on investing in us because they've said quite  bluntly and in confidence, we see how other people are underwriting growth in this category  and we think it's insane and unsustainable.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:28:19):**  And we don't want to waste money investing in a company that has to compete with a company  that has immense resources when they otherwise shouldn't.  And that just creates challenges across the board.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:28:28):**  Imagining some investors listening to this and being like, yeah, that's what you should  do.  You can buy your way in and build yourself the opportunity to have more time to build  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:28:35):**  out this business.  And yet probably some of the farmers and experienced business folks in our audience saying like,  that's crazy.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:28:43):**  Go back to the fundamentals.  These businesses have to make money.  Like the music's going to stop and people won't have chairs.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:28:48):**  What's your reaction, Matthew?  Yeah, I mean, empathy for founders.  Like it sucks to be on the other side of that equation and it goes a bit to that attention  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:28:59):**  versus reputation conundrum, right?  On the one hand, when you think you're doing it the right way, you're doing it for the  right reasons, you're doing it at the right pace.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:29:08):**  It's pretty frustrating to see these massive raises and a lot of attention being garnered  for reasons that aren't long-term, that aren't sustainable.  But if venture has shown us anything, it's that access to capital isn't a formula for  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:29:24):**  success.  That they're effectively, the amount of capital available is unlimited and unlimited money  can't buy you success.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:29:34):**  It can buy you attention and it can buy you near-term opportunity.  And so I don't think it's like fundamentals like EBITDA profit, it's fundamentals as in  if your business model is superior, if the combination of your innovation and your insight  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:29:50):**  and your business model has superior economics, you will prevail.  And that it will require that you find investors who understand that.  But I think that just draws us straight back to the previous conversations around matching  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:30:05):**  with the right investors and understanding why they think you're the right investment.  So to get through that messy middle, like money can make it wider, money can feel like  it makes it easier to cross.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:30:18):**  But I've never seen evidence that it's actually true that money gets you through the messy  middle.  Execution and business model and defensible innovation, still the formula that I truly  
**[0:30:31-0:30:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:30:31):**  believe in.  For founders, understanding their potential partners and investors is really only part  of the battle.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:30:38):**  They have to understand their customers, but also understanding their own company when  they go into a raise and what about their business are they going to be communicating  to investors and how are they going to help debunk some of that complexity or overcome  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:30:49):**  some of those objections, which is something that Jasmine has talked about.  It's been very important for us to be really upfront with our investors about the operational  and technology risk that comes with producing large commercial quantities of very valuable  
**[0:31:06-0:31:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:06):**  products over the coming years.  And I think that this is really important.  You really want to bring on board investors who understand obviously the potential of  
**[0:31:16-0:31:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:16):**  the products that you're bringing to the market and the problem that they're solving, but  also be very real about the risks that are there along the way as you're building.  I love this point because when founders don't talk openly or realistically about the risks  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:32):**  and where there's still work to be done, it's almost like, well, I don't believe you.  I've now lost conviction in the other parts of what you're talking about because of course  there's going to be risk and of course there's going to be things that are uncertain.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:43):**  And so, yeah, it's tough.  It's easy for me to say on the investor side of the table, show me your weaknesses.  And so for founders finding the right way to say, here's what we have de-risked and  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:52):**  here's how we've done it.  Here's some of the other risks and here's our plan to de-risk it.  And here's the hypotheses that we're testing out that are going to continue to build conviction  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:00):**  around how we're going to reduce risk in these different areas.  So I think that kind of hypothesis testing can be one framework that founders use, but  absolutely not avoiding the tough conversation around things that haven't been proven or  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:11):**  things that are going to be challenging to do.  Listen to all this input from founders and responding to it has wondering what our other  investors think.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:18):**  So we reached out to a couple of people in our network and the first person we spoke  to was Michael Dean from AgFunder who talked about the influx of climate tech funds.  I generally see it as a positive development because obviously it's providing a larger  
**[0:32:33-0:32:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:33):**  pool of capital for early stage investing.  There's far more agri-food technology startups out there than capital to deploy.  And really any increase in the available pool of capital has to be a good thing in my view.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:45):**  It's win-win also because it's a new source of co-investors for our startups and LPs for  our funds.  But we're also lending our domain expertise to them to de-risk the sector for climate  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:55):**  impact investors entering the agri-food space for the first time.  There's definitely a growing awareness among impact investors of the large role the food  system can play in meeting global climate goals.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:07):**  So this additional capital is really welcome in my view.  Yeah, that kind of makes me go back to the point originally about sort of generalist  investors and software in particular.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:19):**  A lot of venture, the sort of templates and the patents as we talked about before have  largely been applied to software.  And that's an interesting conundrum.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:28):**  Like on the one hand, we've already said these are massive problems that dwarf almost all  other categories in scale.  And so of course we need more money, we need more capital coming in, but at the same time  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:40):**  recognize that there is that collaborative element that Michael talked directly to there,  which is helping bring those investors on that journey of really understanding what's  the same and what's different here.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:53):**  And so I think that's a fascinating role for sector specific funds to consider is being  welcoming, really wanting those other investor types to come in and be writing checks and  co-investing, but at the same time, recognizing there will be a period where a lot of that  
**[0:34:09-0:34:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:09):**  is building up that knowledge and understanding of what's different about investing in food  and ag and climate and why the kind of some of the templates aren't a good match for the  way you have to go about things in these sectors.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:25):**  One of the things Michael mentioned as well is like this focus on impact has meant more  LPs or more investors for venture capital funds.  And that's a whole interesting spectrum as well that we've had to navigate it.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:38):**  Some funds or some investors just want impact as in ESG reporting and ways to adhere to  their compliance requirements, especially for larger institutional investors.  The bar for impact is more of a compliance one than it is a alignment to the sector or  
**[0:34:54-0:34:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:54):**  delivering on a particular metric.  Whereas on the other end of the spectrum, you'll have individuals or family offices  who are much more focused on like, how are you reporting on this impact?  
**[0:35:02-0:35:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:02):**  How do you make sure that their mission doesn't creep over time?  What specific metrics are you looking at?  And that is fantastic from an alignment to the sector, but has its own challenges, but  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:10):**  it has its own challenges because in an early stage company, your business model might change,  your customers might change, your product might change.  And so how much can you as an investor mandate a certain kind of reporting or a certain metric  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:23):**  when these companies are on a journey where a lot of things are going to change and that's  actually what we want them to do as they do the work to discover what's actually going  to scale.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:31):**  We asked a similar question to Mark Kahn, who is investing in ag tech in India with  Omnivore Partners.  What it's meant is much more money for the ecosystem, the ability for companies to scale  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:42):**  up and rising valuations.  Definitely not bad things for early stage investors like us, but sometimes generalists  have their own biases.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:57):**  They like outputs and market linkages more than inputs.  They dislike fintech, certainly farmer facing fintech and that's been a more of a challenge.  So they bring their own biases, which to be clear are informed from their experience working  
**[0:36:14-0:36:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:14):**  on other parts of the Indian economy.  And sometimes that's a good thing and sometimes that's challenging, but it's certainly something  that we have to deal with.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:21):**  That's something we've had to deal with a little bit too, Matthew, being a sector specific  investor and looking at businesses where we automatically know something's not going to  work or we've looked at that space and debunked an approach for one reason or another, and  
**[0:36:33-0:36:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:33):**  then seeing other investors who aren't sector specific kind of pile in to those areas.  It's like the Rumsfeldian hierarchy, right?  Like I think the conviction that we have is known knowns.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:46):**  Like we have confidence doing what we do and confidence saying no to things where we've  got well-formed hypotheses.  And I think that's maybe that's the kind of definition of that Mark was talking about  
**[0:36:56-0:37:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:56):**  there, which is as a sector specific investor, you can be confident or have confidence in  saying yes to something.  You can have confidence in saying no to something for the reasons you were saying no.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:08):**  Doesn't mean that there aren't investments that you might pass on, you know, that other  investors or general investors can get there.  So I think the net result being more, you talked about more money being available, clearly  
**[0:37:21-0:37:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:21):**  a good thing.  The net result of the pressure on valuation is something that can be a good and can be  a bad thing.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:27):**  There are benefits and challenges with the cycles that early stage kind of cut the valuations  go through.  So I think the, yeah, that sort of pushing into that idea of the difference between kind  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:39):**  of sector specific investing and that we talked about before from the founder point of view,  what work can you see that this investor has done in forming hypotheses the year, how are  they testing them?  
**[0:37:50-0:37:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:50):**  How does that align with what you want to do?  Some of those probably are just about how can you get to a yes or a no faster, right?  Those are really important considerations from the investor point of view and from the  
**[0:38:01-0:38:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:01):**  founder point of view is eventually like money in someone else's bank account is no good  to your business.  And so, you know, working out how you can get to a yes or get to a no faster is exploring  
**[0:38:14-0:38:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:14):**  this territory.  Are they sector specific?  Are they general as to what do we need to talk about?  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:19):**  How do we need to talk about ourselves to be a match for what they're looking for, how  they're going to evaluate us?  And I think actually a couple of the founders touch on things like that as well.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:29):**  So I think from both sides that that kind of works as a, as an area to really focus  on how can we get to a yes or a no faster.  Yeah.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:38):**  And Mark's other point around the benefit to seed stage investors is for those of us  who are sector specific or in those early stages, we absolutely need other investors  to back these companies and for founders to find great partners for those later stages  
**[0:38:50-0:38:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:50):**  of the journey.  So part of what we been focusing on is like, how do we build those partnerships?  How do we build those bridges to downstream funds and help them understand what's challenging  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:00):**  about food and ag, but then what's super exciting and how to think about different channels  and what's worked in the past and what hasn't.  So I've really enjoyed over the past couple of years, talking to these other investors  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:10):**  around like why food and ag and how to get comfortable with the early stages or with  the impact that, that food and ag is really able to unlock because we need it to do less  bad in the world, but we also have opportunities for food and ag to provide solutions to decarbonize  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:25):**  the rest of the economy.  And investors really need to understand that.  Yeah, I find that part super exciting, right?  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:30):**  Like the enthusiasm that Michael and Mark both had about welcoming in other investors,  like you hear smack talk almost in other parts of venture where it sounds really competitive  and almost a bit cutthroat.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:43):**  And we just don't experience that.  And so that, that kind of collaborative nature and the welcoming in of new sources of capital  maybe when there's trillions and trillions of dollars available to ag and climate founders,  
**[0:39:55-0:39:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:55):**  I'll feel different, leave it right now.  I'm full of enthusiasm for all this additional capital coming in.  We've talked a little bit about COVID and a little bit about climate capital coming  
**[0:40:04-0:40:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:40:04):**  in.  One of the other changes that has happened in last year is the entrance of new forms  of exits like SPACs, which is something that Michael also commented on.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:40:12):**  We have had a few examples of things that haven't quite gone to plan.  One of those relates to SPACs or special purpose acquisition companies.  And whilst they've been seen as a really positive development for ag tech, which has struggled  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:40:25):**  for quite a while to identify where the exits are going to come from.  And of course, deliver returns to investors.  There are definite risks to the public markets, particularly in the ag tech space.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:40:36):**  I think one of our well performing and really promising textile ups was bundled into a SPAC  last year as part of a larger production offering.  As you know, it's fundamental to public markets that you need to have that constant drumbeat  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:40:49):**  of good news around revenue and margins in order to see your share price climb, particularly  in agriculture, I think.  Unfortunately, during the mandatory hold period for us as existing investors, we've seen the  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:41:02):**  value of our investment fall dramatically because that drumbeat of good news just hasn't  been there.  Struggles with production levels, struggles with profitability have really been an anchor  
**[0:41:12-0:41:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:41:12):**  on the share price.  This of course is outside our control.  But it really is a reminder that not all public market exits go the way you want them to.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:41:21):**  That's such an important point that Michael's making there.  If you think explaining a complex business to a professional investor is hard, try explaining  it to the public markets.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:41:31):**  I just think that there's macro cycles to consider there as well.  But in the end, Michael's 100% right in terms of you've got to constantly provide digestible,  easily understood information about the positive progress of the business.  
**[0:41:53-0:42:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:41:53):**  So we've just finished a decently long conversation talking about complexity and doing hard things  and getting dirty.  I think there is a degree of risk there around a fundamental impedance mismatch between industrially  
**[0:42:09-0:42:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:09):**  specific complex businesses and public markets.  And whilst that kind of stack window, like in terms of financial engineering technology,  it's an interesting innovation.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:22):**  But in the end, you're a public vehicle and you've got to keep the public markets fed  with morsels of easily digested information.  And if you're a growing business in a complex area, man, I think you've jumped from the  
**[0:42:38-0:42:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:38):**  frying pan into the fire.  Yeah.  And it goes back to what some of the founders said around both communicating to investors,  
**[0:42:44-0:42:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:44):**  but keeping focused on what are the fundamentals of the business?  How do we build value here?  What are the unlock codes that we need to be doubling down on?  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:52):**  And yeah, Mark said that as well in terms of how he's supporting his portfolio companies  around what to stay focused on.  I think in general, just keeping our founders focused on product market fit and not chasing  
**[0:43:04-0:43:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:43:04):**  vanity metrics is very important.  I think that's great advice, but pretty hard to execute depending on where you are.  So the idea that like when we use this phrase of vanity metric, I think that's true from  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:43:20):**  someone's perspective.  When you say like something that we're choosing about ourselves to pump our own tires up,  that's not quite the same as presenting the information that the receiver is expecting.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:43:33):**  They're trying to fit you into a template.  And so rather than do the work of properly understand your business and properly understanding  what represents success for you, we also get trapped into this idea of packaging up information  
**[0:43:46-0:43:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:43:46):**  in a way that other people already understand it.  And it's appealing because it's a shortcut, but it's high risk because you're really not  accepting and actually goes back to one of the previous founder quotes about being open  
**[0:44:01-0:44:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:01):**  and honest about the true risks in your business.  I think when you putting up substitute metrics, you're risking hiding too much complexity.  You're risking making it too easy for someone to think of you one way when really you're  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:15):**  another and that's not likely to last.  Matthew, you've raised money a couple of times, both obviously for Tenacious Ventures Fund  one, but also with Observin and in your past lives.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:30):**  Any of these founder quotes or investor quotes bring particularly true for you and your experience  or any stories that come to mind from scars you may or may not have?  Well the first company I was a co-founder of was actually acquired by a newly minted  
**[0:44:43-0:44:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:43):**  NASDAQ IPO company and it was nuts.  We had worked with them maybe for six months.  They were a customer first and then they acquired us.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:52):**  So we had worked with them for a decent period before they went public and then after they  went public, it was literally like walking into a different company.  The rhythm of the company had changed.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:02):**  The focus of the company was entirely focused around this crazy quarterly cycle of providing  information to the market and it had a really negative impact on product development.  It just unnecessarily, now that was early days and it was dot com and all kind of stuff.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:20):**  So probably you got a bunch of reasons why there's a much better understanding, but I  think just that's especially tragic to have a high potential company that all of a sudden  their ability to make progress has sort of been thwarted or impeded by the very thing  
**[0:45:36-0:45:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:36):**  that you were sort of hoping to do as an unlock.  So I think that kind of to me is one kind of thing to draw out here, which is really  understanding the source of capital and how tapping into that source of capital is going  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:50):**  to deliver for what you really need to get done because money for the sake of money won't  ever be worth it.  That deal won't ever be worth doing.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:59):**  Which actually leads to why we wanted to do this episode.  We've had some of our founders, we've seen them raising, we've seen other raises, we've  talked on panels with other founders raising and noticing some of the differences in the  
**[0:46:12-0:46:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:46:12):**  climate tech space with more money coming in there and how that contrasts with generalist  VCs, but then also software businesses versus more deep tech companies, whether that's food  and manufacturing or hardware.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:46:23):**  So I think that was one of the big stimuluses to reach out to the folks in our network and  get some thoughts on what it's been like to raise over the past couple of years.  The reflection for us is specific to the stage that we're currently at too, which is a lot  
**[0:46:38-0:46:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:46:38):**  of our time with mostly constructed portfolio has actually been in helping founders move  on to that next stage of investment.  And that sort of investor to investor contact with their downstream is actually quite different  
**[0:46:51-0:47:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:46:51):**  than co-investor contact and the sort of understanding of how can you help package up these complex  ideas in a way that results in the additional funding, the deeper impact, the broader penetration.  We talked about timeframes and I think here the knowing the difference between something  
**[0:47:19-0:47:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:47:19):**  that's reactionary in nature versus something that feels persistent is really important.  I think some of the things we've seen as outcomes from the pandemic are already shifting more  and more.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:47:32):**  Back in the direction where there were some things feel a lot more permanent.  I think the focusing on the length of the supply chain is I think a permanent change.  And I think that's something that we continue to have a lot of confidence around.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:47:45):**  You point solutions that are looking at specific participants in food or agri or climate don't  feel like the right solve now.  I think we've got to a point where you've got to be taking a broader, longer view of  
**[0:47:58-0:48:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:47:58):**  value capture and delivery.  As we draw this bonus episode to a close, one of the biggest things that sticks out  to me is that for all the shifts we continue to see in agtech investing and entrepreneurship,  
**[0:48:10-0:48:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:48:10):**  these changes have made the fundamentals in this space more, not less important.  These are things like building conviction and strong relationships with investors and  founders and doing the work to build a thesis and to find investors who have a thesis.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:48:25):**  Also focusing on solid metrics and finally transparent communication, whether you're  a founder or an investor.  Though at the same time, we're sure that as global systems adapt to further changes, whether  
**[0:48:37-0:48:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:48:37):**  that's ongoing evolutions to the pandemic, climate threats, the war in Ukraine or supply  chain disruptions, there will continue to be ongoing transformations.  And that's really where you come in.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:48:48):**  We want to know what you think we're getting right, what we're getting wrong and what we  might have missed in terms of changes over recent years.

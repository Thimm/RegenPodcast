### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 30 Mar 2022 19:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to a very special bonus episode of AgTech So What.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:06):**  I'm Sarah Nalet, your host, but today I'm also going to be wearing another hat.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:11):**  As most listeners probably already know, in addition to hosting this lovely podcast, I'm  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:16):**  also a general partner at Tenacious Ventures alongside my co-founder, Matthew Pryor, who  
**[0:00:21-0:00:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:21):**  will, in the spirit of new hats, be co-hosting with me today.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:24):**  Hey, Matthew.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:25):**  Hey, Sarah.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:26):**  Thanks for the intro.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:27):**  Hey, everyone.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:28):**  Over the years, we've had a ton of fascinating conversations on this podcast with experts  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:33):**  from farmers to founders to investors, and that has served as a kind of loose record  
**[0:00:38-0:00:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:38):**  of how shifts in the world have led to shifts in AgTech in general and AgTech investing  
**[0:00:44-0:00:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:44):**  in particular.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:45):**  At the same time, behind the scenes, we've been building and revising our own thinking  
**[0:00:49-0:00:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:49):**  in light of current events.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:51):**  We thought it'd be interesting to highlight some of those insights on the state of AgTech  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:00:55):**  investing, where it's been, where it's going, and what we think is the most interesting  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:00):**  about where it is today in 2022.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:03):**  But before we dive in, I want to say that this episode is definitely not investment  
**[0:01:07-0:01:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:07):**  advice.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:08):**  And for full transparency, we at Tenacious Ventures are investors in a couple of the  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:12):**  companies you'll hear from, including Go Terra, Nowadays, and Cecil.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:16):**  So to start off this conversation, we asked a group of founders and investors some questions  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:21):**  around their fundraising and investing over the last couple of years, including COVID,  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:25):**  massive climate shifts, changing economic and social conditions, and more.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:29):**  You'll hear their responses throughout the episode, starting with Matthew reflecting  
**[0:01:33-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:33):**  back on the many months since March 2020 when COVID hit and we at Tenacious Ventures first  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:39):**  started investing.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:41):**  It's the opposite of the kind of frog in the water scenario.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:45):**  This just feels like the way it's always been to us in terms of we were born literally in  
**[0:01:50-0:01:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:50):**  the teeth of COVID as an investor.  
**[0:01:53-0:02:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:01:53):**  So I think that leveling the idea that geography matters so much less, the idea that all of  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:00):**  a sudden the complexity and fragility of supply chain started to become really apparent.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:04):**  I think those are all the reflections, but in some way it felt like we were looking at  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:09):**  it from the inside rather than from the outside.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:11):**  And I think that's interesting.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:13):**  And to get the different perspectives of that, both from the kind of founders, how it's opened  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:17):**  up new opportunities for them, but also for investors, how it's actually quite changed  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:21):**  both their relationship to where they might invest in who, but also how investors relate  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:26):**  to each other.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:27):**  I think there's just so much that's interesting there that in reality has actually happened  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:30):**  over a pretty short period of time.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:31):**  Do you want to tell that story when you say we were born right on the cusp of it?  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:35):**  Like there's a couple of tidbits there that people might not know?  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:38):**  I believe the date of our first close still holds the record for the largest single day  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:44):**  drop on the Australian securities exchange.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:47):**  It was pretty interesting as first time managers.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:51):**  I guess we didn't really have that much of a thought about the kind of macro trends as  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:02:56):**  they relate to us actually getting money transferred into our bank account.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:00):**  But as we were witnessing the carnage on the public markets, cast a couple of thoughts  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:06):**  as to where all the money would actually appear in the bank account on the day.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:09):**  But of course everything went swimmingly and all of our fantastic LPs are long-term investors  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:15):**  and we've been busy since then.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:17):**  Yes.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:18):**  Yeah, that was definitely a change over the course of us raising is we had talked to people  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:21):**  in like August, September, October, 2019.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:24):**  And then by the time we actually did our first capital call and final close, it was March  
**[0:03:28-0:03:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:28):**  2020.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:30):**  And so it was like a pretty different world we lived in when we first started calling  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:33):**  capital and making investments.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:34):**  So we've been on this journey as well.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:36):**  And obviously COVID is one thing that's changed and the fall on effects of that in terms of  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:40):**  supply chains, macroeconomic conditions, people's reflections on their time and how they're  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:45):**  spending it as they've sat at home and thought differently about career and passion.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:50):**  I think it's a great time for food and ag, but it's had some both positive and negative  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:54):**  impacts on entrepreneurs for sure.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:56):**  So one of the big things that's changed, and I noticed this because I spent five months  
**[0:03:59-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:03:59):**  in the US in 2021 was just the absolute influx of climate focused investors.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:07):**  And that's both existing funds, attracting institutional investors who have ESG or other  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:12):**  types of climate or impact reporting requirements, as well as people seeing the opportunity to  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:18):**  do something about climate change and technology's role in that.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:21):**  And again, that's also had positive and negative impacts in terms of their knowledge of climate  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:26):**  and the requirements to do stuff with different technologies than software and how that plays  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:30):**  out in food and ag and complexity of value chains.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:33):**  So again, positives and negatives, but that was one that shocked me as everyone I talked  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:37):**  to in the States is raising a climate fund, talking about a climate fund, having climate  
**[0:04:42-0:04:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:42):**  pressures on their funds.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:43):**  So maybe that's just the bubble that I live in, but I think that's definitely different  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:46):**  than it was previously.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:47):**  Actually, I think that's another, that's a good kind of prompt there in terms of things  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:52):**  that have changed significantly is the dramatic reversal of globalization that we've all just  
**[0:04:58-0:05:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:04:58):**  cropped already, like this whole idea of sovereign capability and just in time, we've all just  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:05:05):**  absorbed a different world and don't fully recognize how fundamentally value chains and  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:05:12):**  supply chains, especially ones that were multi-step international.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:05:16):**  I would say every day that we have conversations with founders in hardware businesses, they  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:05:21):**  always mention the fact that there are still massive delays in parts and particularly in  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:05:26):**  electronics, but we've just, I don't know, it feels like we just have moved on from that.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:05:32):**  And yet it really is such a dramatic difference.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:05:34):**  And we talk about just in case now in terms of rather than just in time and things like  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:05:39):**  that.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:05:40):**  So I think there has been a pretty significant replumbing of global supply chains that we've

**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:06:02):**  We asked Jasmine Hume, CEO and founder of the US-based alternative protein company,  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:06:07):**  Shiru, what the experience of raising over the last two years was like for her.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:06:11):**  The experience we had was completely different where investors coming from a lot of different  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:06:16):**  backgrounds and having a portfolio theses across a couple of different sectors, not

**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:06:28):**  rounds and really very eerily trying to allocate their capital to some of these companies,  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:06:33):**  especially in our field, like alternative proteins and food technology.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:06:38):**  I think that COVID has had a big impact there for sure.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:06:41):**  It's brought to light a lot of major issues, particularly as it relates to our food supply  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:06:45):**  chain considering the products that traditionally come from animals like meat and milk and the  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:06:50):**  struggles that we've had in being able to keep up production in a stable way over the  
**[0:06:56-0:06:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:06:56):**  course of the pandemic.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:06:57):**  So definitely the influx of investors that we've had and we've gotten to know recently  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:03):**  over the last year, this year, have been very excited to focus more of their capital on  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:08):**  companies that are really addressing issues concerning the climate.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:12):**  Yeah, I've seen this climate focus play out in a couple ways.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:16):**  One it's made sectors like alternative protein, given the kind of hype that's been around  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:21):**  it and some of the exits and large raises we've seen in this space look attractive to  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:25):**  investors.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:26):**  It's also maybe caused some hesitation as we've seen share prices fall and performance  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:31):**  maybe not be what people thought it would be.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:34):**  And there's this dynamic in alternative protein, especially where I think there's this musical  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:38):**  chairs game going and everyone wants an alternative protein investment, but then once you have  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:42):**  one, are you going to make another one?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:43):**  And so there's investors who've really done the work to understand this space and might  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:47):**  have multiple investments and some who it seems a little bit are like, Oh, the stats  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:52):**  around substituting out meat are compelling.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:55):**  And so from a climate perspective, this is an easy place to be investing and look, there's  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:07:58):**  a track record of exits here.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:00):**  So unpacking a little bit of what the drivers are for funding in alternative protein, specifically  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:05):**  as it relates to climate, you get a couple of different nuances there.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:08):**  Yeah, I think maybe another dimension there that does relate to animal agriculture is  
**[0:08:15-0:08:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:15):**  that the pandemic did show us how susceptible animal agriculture is to human input in the  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:24):**  supply chain, particularly in the kind of processing we saw massive disruptions in the  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:29):**  processing.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:30):**  And so I think that's an interesting point there in terms of what specific industries  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:36):**  the pandemic had an impact on and it has and will continue to accelerate some things.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:41):**  I think that we already have seen, we'll continue to see significant automation, for example,  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:46):**  in processing in animal agriculture.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:48):**  Like it's the other, that idea of that direct connection that we always really struggle  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:52):**  about with where food comes from and its relationship to climate and susceptibility.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:08:58):**  When you walk down a supermarket aisle and there is literally nothing in it, I think  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:03):**  it's a little easier for the majority of people to sort of understand why we need to pay more  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:09):**  attention to where food comes from and how susceptible our food system is to shocks of  
**[0:09:15-0:09:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:15):**  all kinds.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:16):**  One of the things I hope does not go back to a similar level as before COVID is how  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:20):**  much people are focused on investing in climate.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:22):**  That's definitely been a positive for the world that we need capital deployed in this  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:26):**  space and that we need people understanding it and thinking about it and investing in  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:29):**  entrepreneurs in this space.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:31):**  My concern is that climate tech is not easy and it's not always just software as a service  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:37):**  with tried and true business models.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:39):**  There's some complexity here.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:40):**  We always talk about you can't eat software.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:44):**  And so in food and ag, we need tangible things.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:46):**  We need to think about hardware and robotics.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:48):**  That's definitely one of my concerns is how much this climate tech capital will stick  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:51):**  around.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:52):**  And I know that's a concern that Olympia at Olivia Yager, founder and CEO of Gotara definitely  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:57):**  has.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:09:58):**  There's a lot of interest in climate tech and there's a lot of funds that are looking  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:10:03):**  at this space and wanting to deploy funds into the space.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:10:07):**  The challenges that we're seeing are that at this time, there's still not great structure  
**[0:10:15-0:10:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:10:15):**  or patterns developed around how to assess and or strategically address how these new  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:10:23):**  innovations that include hardware fit into a venture capital model.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:10:27):**  And so there is this sort of sense that every now and again, you're around peg square hole  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:10:31):**  because we're still using old venture models that are designed for SAS to assess hardware  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:10:36):**  companies.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:10:37):**  Yeah, that's something we have set out to do.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:10:41):**  Matthew, what have your reflections been on how hard or easy it's been to assess hardware  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:10:47):**  businesses and have a portfolio that includes deep tech and software?  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:10:51):**  This always reminds me of a film quote, which hopefully Olivia will appreciate.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:10:55):**  Django Unchained, where they first get together and Django's acting really weird.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:01):**  And he's, I can't remember the other actor's name, but he says to him, what are you doing?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:05):**  And Django says, I'm getting dirty.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:07):**  And that's the thing.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:08):**  When you want to get stuff done, real stuff done in climate and in ag, you got to get  
**[0:11:13-0:11:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:13):**  dirty.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:14):**  You've got to get your hands dirty.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:15):**  You've got to get involved in the real world.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:17):**  And I think that's the struggle that a lot of founders have.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:21):**  And I think at that intersection of climate tech and ag tech to make real progress, to  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:26):**  have real impact, you can't just move bits around.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:32):**  You got to get into atoms and molecules and those things add significant levels of complexity.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:39):**  So I think that it's great in a way where we've got focused funds who can spend the  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:43):**  time to really understand and win climate tech, which obviously isn't much broader and  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:11:49):**  still gets pretty real in terms of other parts of the real world that need decarbonization.

**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:00):**  do the work to really understand why problems need to be solved a particular way.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:04):**  So when you look at a company like Go Terra, where there's all of that complexity across  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:08):**  digital and electronic and biological, that there are people there who really can understand  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:13):**  why you're doing things that particular way.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:17):**  I'm imagining potential investors listening to this going, yeah, but like, are you going  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:22):**  to make any money?  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:23):**  Cause it's capex intensive and their stuff's going to get stuck in supply chains.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:27):**  And how do you diligence it?  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:29):**  Cause they don't have revenue because it took so long to build this product.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:32):**  What's your response to why we need to be doing this and how to make money doing it?  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:37):**  My initial response is because eventually the seagulls will take over and will cease  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:42):**  existing on the planet.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:44):**  These are really big and very important problems and managing post-consumer waste is a very  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:50):**  large problem.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:51):**  And so, yeah, kind of goes back to the hard things, right?  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:12:57):**  You have to do hard things to solve these problems and it will require more patience,  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:04):**  but we talk about venture scale, like what could be more venture scale than something  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:08):**  that impacts every person on the planet.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:12):**  So I'm not worried about it from a returns point of view.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:16):**  It may be that we will be required to be more patient than an average investor, but everything  
**[0:13:22-0:13:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:22):**  that we're touching touches every person on the planet.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:25):**  So the scale is definitely there and these problems we can see every day are big and  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:29):**  important and must be solved.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:31):**  One of the things I've been thinking about a lot is like how boring it would be to only  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:36):**  look at software companies and there's three different business models and they all are  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:40):**  doing the same things.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:41):**  And yes, there's an argument for the absolute brilliance that has had in terms of transforming  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:46):**  our world and software eating the world and all of those things.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:48):**  And yet the complexity is truly what we need to embrace to solve giant challenges.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:54):**  I think it's Kara Swisher that said somewhat recently around like, we've had a lot of unicorns  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:13:59):**  and billion dollar companies, but what's the first trillion dollar company going to be?  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:03):**  It's going to be a climate tech startup.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:04):**  And I couldn't be more in alignment with that.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:06):**  Like the problems are so big and those are going to require either complex business models  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:11):**  or complex technology.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:12):**  So one of the things we've been spending time on is how do you assess and evaluate those  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:17):**  companies to Olympia's point?  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:18):**  Like it's not an apples to apples comparison.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:20):**  So two things that come to mind that we do differently is spend time on the business  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:27):**  model, how they will actually get the technology into the hands of the users.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:31):**  And in software, again, there's only a couple of different business models, but in the hardware  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:34):**  space or in different deep tech areas, really thinking about who's using the technology,  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:39):**  who's going to benefit, how does it fit into the existing supply chain?  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:42):**  How are we going to get it to scale?  
**[0:14:44-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:44):**  Who's going to service it?  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:45):**  What are the costs of maintenance over the longterm?  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:47):**  Those are things we really need to appreciate and understand.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:49):**  And then the other one is how do we think about the founder and the capital intensity  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:54):**  of the business model and how they're going to be able to manage that complexity and communicate  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:14:59):**  it to downstream investors, because it's one thing for us to believe that this is needed  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:15:03):**  and another for them to be able to get other investors on board.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:15:07):**  And so those are two things we end up thinking a lot about.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:15:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:15:11):**  I think that to what Olympia was talking about there in terms of kind of understanding, even  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:15:18):**  if it weren't hardware in a climate tech or an ag tech sense, there are similar levels  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:15:23):**  of complexity in a lot of the other systems that have to be transformed.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:15:28):**  And there are clearly a very sophisticated investors with well-formed thesis.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:15:33):**  I think kind of Olympia's point there is really about a match.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:15:38):**  And so it may be that the investor hasn't necessarily looked at something like your  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:15:44):**  business in particular, but I think testing out how comfortable they are with the realities  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:15:50):**  of there needing to be multiple elements, that there will be a level of capital complexity  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:15:55):**  as a founder, having those conversations, understanding where those investors sit in  
**[0:16:00-0:16:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:00):**  terms of that kind of reality, previous experience with the kind of point at which capital stops  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:07):**  being put into infrastructure and starts being put into scalable growth.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:12):**  Those are super important because if you're the person who is educating the investor on  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:16):**  that stuff, it's going to take a pretty long time and probably longer than you've got for  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:20):**  your current raise.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:21):**  That qualifying investor point is so important.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:23):**  And even there's investors given this influx of climate money who think that they want  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:28):**  to do these deep tech companies.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:30):**  And I know I've had conversations where it's like, great.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:32):**  So you say that you are comfortable with this area.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:34):**  I don't see any companies in your portfolio that realize that.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:37):**  And they're like, oh yeah, yeah, we really want to.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:38):**  And then I talk through some of the companies in our portfolio and others that I know that  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:42):**  might be raising and offer intros or connections.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:45):**  And inevitably most of them come back saying, oh yeah, that's just not really a fit for  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:48):**  us.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:49):**  Oh, it looks a bit complicated or it looks a bit complex.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:51):**  So I think there's like an attention for investors who have just been trained to look at different  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:16:56):**  kinds of businesses and the kind of upskilling of the sector as investors that will need  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:17:01):**  to be able to make this jump in and look at these kinds of companies.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:17:05):**  This conversation makes me think about something that Alex Logan, one of the co-founders of  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:17:09):**  Cecil said about how his thinking has evolved around engaging with potential investors,  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:17:14):**  specifically how it was critical to ensure that what an investor believes truly aligns  
**[0:17:20-0:17:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:17:20):**  with what they say.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:17:21):**  And that first meeting is probably going to go really well because you're not just going  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:17:25):**  to talk about this amazing journey that you've been on as a founder to starting this business,  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:17:31):**  but you're also going to be telling an amazing story about this new category or this new  
**[0:17:35-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:17:35):**  opportunity that has emerged to contribute to climate solutions around the world.

**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:17:50):**  the ego, if you're getting to that third meeting and you don't believe that the people on the  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:17:55):**  other side of the table have a strong thesis and you're still educating them on what the  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:18:02):**  opportunity is and why now, then this could be viewed as a potential red flag.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:18:07):**  And what you're actually looking for in that relationship build phase is someone who's  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:18:13):**  going to be riffing with you as to what that future is going to look like.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:18:18):**  And you need to believe that they have a strong thesis as to where the world is going.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:18:23):**  The good news is that these funds do exist.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:18:27):**  They've been out in the market raising capital through LPs for the last two to three years.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:18:34):**  And to do that, they've had to have a strong thesis.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:18:38):**  And now they're in the market deploying capital.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:18:41):**  I think that's a fascinating piece from Alex there because he's talking about the near-term  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:18:47):**  nature of a relationship that you're building with an investor.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:18:51):**  And yet at the same time, talking about something that's a really long-term view.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:18:56):**  And I think that's something that we find a lot with founders.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:00):**  I think that my first reaction is that there are those two time horizons with building  
**[0:19:06-0:19:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:06):**  relationships with investors.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:07):**  The first is knowing whether or not they're an investor for this round.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:10):**  That's super important.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:11):**  And so Alex is getting to that in terms of the red flag could be never going to be an  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:15):**  investor or the red flag could be just not this round.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:19):**  And that's super important to know, obviously, in terms of your planning for a round.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:23):**  I think the second part is what he said about the riffing.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:26):**  That's super important also because as an early stage founder, you're really helping  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:31):**  an investor suspend disbelief.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:34):**  It's not like there's evidence.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:35):**  We talked about SaaS and SaaS metrics and all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:39):**  Companies, particularly companies working in these fields, you're early, you don't have  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:44):**  traditional traction and traditional metrics.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:47):**  And so helping an investor kind of see what you see, believe what you believe is so much  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:53):**  easier if they believe something similar and you can translate their belief for one of  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:19:58):**  multiple hypotheses they might have into the version of the future that you see.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:02):**  And so I think that's super important too.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:03):**  How do you build confidence that this isn't just something that you're never going to  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:07):**  get them over the line on because they want to see hard evidence for someone who's new  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:11):**  to an area.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:13):**  It's difficult to build belief because you don't have hypotheses to kind of hang those  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:17):**  beliefs around.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:18):**  And I think that's what Alex is kind of talking about there is how do you recognize when you're  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:23):**  talking to someone who has already formed hypotheses in your area and what can you give  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:29):**  them to align the version of the future that you see with one that they're prepared to  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:34):**  back?  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:35):**  I really like what he was saying about qualifying questions because it's kind of where the rubber  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:39):**  meets the road on what you're saying there, Matthew.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:42):**  So asking about what thesis did you pitch your LPs on or how did you raise your money?  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:48):**  And I think founders sometimes feel like they've got to be on stage pitching to investors or  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:53):**  like talking the whole time.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:55):**  I know I really appreciate it when founders ask us about our journey as fund managers  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:20:59):**  and who our investors are and what thesis is we've developed and do we form thesis ahead  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:05):**  of time?  
**[0:21:06-0:21:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:06):**  Have we looked at the space they're in?  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:07):**  How do we think about it?  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:08):**  So there's lots of qualifying questions.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:10):**  The one that I really like when founders do is asking us to share back our view of the  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:15):**  space that they're in, especially after we've had a meeting because it's such a good way  
**[0:21:18-0:21:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:18):**  for them to qualify.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:20):**  Do we actually know what we're talking about here?  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:21):**  Have we thought deeply about what part of alternative protein we want to invest in or  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:25):**  what are the unlock codes in waste or what's going to matter in nature based solutions  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:29):**  as the market scales up and there's more supply and these kinds of things.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:33):**  So that for founders not being afraid to really push investors to qualify them and having  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:38):**  some of those like practical specific questions to ask and make sure it's going to be a good  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:42):**  fit for a long-term partnership.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:44):**  Yeah, actually I like that as a link between what Olympia was talking about and what Alex  
**[0:21:50-0:21:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:50):**  is talking about just in terms of how do you dig into how well the conversation is going  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:21:57):**  in terms of actually it's about something that we're both comfortable with or we can  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:02):**  both get comfortable with, you know, whether that's hardware and an investor might say,  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:07):**  yeah, we're okay with hardware.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:09):**  Okay, but how do you think about investing in infrastructure?  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:13):**  What experience have you had combining debt financing with venture financing as a hardware  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:18):**  based startup scales?  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:20):**  I think getting to details there will be really important part of building that confidence  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:26):**  that this isn't first time for everybody because that's going to be slow going most likely.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:31):**  I want to play another quote from Olympia at Go Terra here, which I think is super relevant  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:36):**  for founders tactically to this whole conversation about vetting and getting comfortable with  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:41):**  potential investors.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:42):**  I think every round I forget that the game is geared for the founder to be a fundraiser,  
**[0:22:51-0:22:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:51):**  not a CEO.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:52):**  And when I say I forget that, what I mean is it doesn't seem to matter how often I try  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:22:59):**  to start the round early.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:23:01):**  It's never really early enough for the get to know you period.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:23:04):**  And I'm a fairly hands on founder.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:23:06):**  And so I've spent most of my time trying to work in the business being a founder.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:23:10):**  And the reality is that the way the architecture and the ecosystem works for VC at the moment,  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:23:17):**  the CEO needs to spend more than half of their time actively working with investors to get  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:23:24):**  them to know you to build relationships and understand your business.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:23:30):**  This is one that is absolutely true and it's one of those tropes of VC and startup is like  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:23:35):**  your job as a founder is to be fundraising.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:23:38):**  And I think people say that and hear that and don't realize how true it is.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:23:43):**  And yet it's not just about show me the money, I'm pitching all the time.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:23:46):**  I'm this like on stage doing the dance.

**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:25:56):**  in the future versus the mindset of talking to investors, which is much more like, what

**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:03):**  How far are we going to get?

**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:08):**  audiences that you need to be talking to and how you translate what is still authentic  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:12):**  and truth to the way different people want to hear it and the kinds of frameworks they're  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:17):**  bringing to the conversation.

**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:23):**  on a journey.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:25):**  And so don't tell them everything all at once, except I understand that it's a journey.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:30):**  You'll get them to the next level and then to be able to have the next answer is really  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:34):**  important.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:35):**  Okay.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:36):**  Once you've built that understanding of why this is important, okay, now you've got that.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:40):**  That's why we've done it this way, because once you get here, you'll understand that

**[0:26:47-0:26:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:47):**  So yeah, I think that's a good point.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:48):**  One of the things that this conversation makes me think of around companies raising money,  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:51):**  and if you're always raising how much is too much is more always better.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:55):**  And that's something founders have to think about if they are always having these conversations  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:26:58):**  with investors, especially in really exciting spaces.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:27:01):**  That's something that Max Elder, who's the CEO and co-founder at Nowadays had some thoughts  
**[0:27:05-0:27:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:27:05):**  on.

**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:27:13):**  across the board and the doubling of venture money globally.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:27:16):**  One is that companies are just raising more money than they should be and more money than  
**[0:27:20-0:27:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:27:20):**  they need to.

**[0:27:25-0:27:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:27:25):**  In fact, investors who may not actually be experts in alternative proteins or even food,  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:27:32):**  a lot of tech investors are starting to invest in this space and founders are going out and

**[0:27:49-0:27:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:27:49):**  problems.

**[0:28:09-0:28:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:28:09):**  bluntly and in confidence, we see how other people are underwriting growth in this category  
**[0:28:16-0:28:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:28:16):**  and we think it's insane and unsustainable.

**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:30:49):**  some of those objections, which is something that Jasmine has talked about.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:30:52):**  It's been very important for us to be really upfront with our investors about the operational  
**[0:30:58-0:31:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:30:58):**  and technology risk that comes with producing large commercial quantities of very valuable  
**[0:31:06-0:31:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:06):**  products over the coming years.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:08):**  And I think that this is really important.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:10):**  You really want to bring on board investors who understand obviously the potential of  
**[0:31:16-0:31:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:16):**  the products that you're bringing to the market and the problem that they're solving, but  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:19):**  also be very real about the risks that are there along the way as you're building.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:25):**  I love this point because when founders don't talk openly or realistically about the risks  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:32):**  and where there's still work to be done, it's almost like, well, I don't believe you.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:36):**  I've now lost conviction in the other parts of what you're talking about because of course  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:40):**  there's going to be risk and of course there's going to be things that are uncertain.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:43):**  And so, yeah, it's tough.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:44):**  It's easy for me to say on the investor side of the table, show me your weaknesses.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:48):**  And so for founders finding the right way to say, here's what we have de-risked and  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:52):**  here's how we've done it.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:53):**  Here's some of the other risks and here's our plan to de-risk it.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:31:56):**  And here's the hypotheses that we're testing out that are going to continue to build conviction  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:00):**  around how we're going to reduce risk in these different areas.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:03):**  So I think that kind of hypothesis testing can be one framework that founders use, but  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:07):**  absolutely not avoiding the tough conversation around things that haven't been proven or  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:11):**  things that are going to be challenging to do.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:14):**  Listen to all this input from founders and responding to it has wondering what our other  
**[0:32:17-0:32:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:17):**  investors think.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:18):**  So we reached out to a couple of people in our network and the first person we spoke  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:22):**  to was Michael Dean from AgFunder who talked about the influx of climate tech funds.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:28):**  I generally see it as a positive development because obviously it's providing a larger  
**[0:32:33-0:32:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:33):**  pool of capital for early stage investing.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:35):**  There's far more agri-food technology startups out there than capital to deploy.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:41):**  And really any increase in the available pool of capital has to be a good thing in my view.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:45):**  It's win-win also because it's a new source of co-investors for our startups and LPs for  
**[0:32:50-0:32:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:50):**  our funds.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:51):**  But we're also lending our domain expertise to them to de-risk the sector for climate  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:55):**  impact investors entering the agri-food space for the first time.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:32:59):**  There's definitely a growing awareness among impact investors of the large role the food  
**[0:33:04-0:33:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:04):**  system can play in meeting global climate goals.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:07):**  So this additional capital is really welcome in my view.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:11):**  Yeah, that kind of makes me go back to the point originally about sort of generalist  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:15):**  investors and software in particular.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:19):**  A lot of venture, the sort of templates and the patents as we talked about before have  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:25):**  largely been applied to software.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:27):**  And that's an interesting conundrum.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:28):**  Like on the one hand, we've already said these are massive problems that dwarf almost all  
**[0:33:34-0:33:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:34):**  other categories in scale.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:35):**  And so of course we need more money, we need more capital coming in, but at the same time  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:40):**  recognize that there is that collaborative element that Michael talked directly to there,  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:45):**  which is helping bring those investors on that journey of really understanding what's  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:51):**  the same and what's different here.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:53):**  And so I think that's a fascinating role for sector specific funds to consider is being  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:33:58):**  welcoming, really wanting those other investor types to come in and be writing checks and  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:04):**  co-investing, but at the same time, recognizing there will be a period where a lot of that  
**[0:34:09-0:34:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:09):**  is building up that knowledge and understanding of what's different about investing in food  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:16):**  and ag and climate and why the kind of some of the templates aren't a good match for the  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:22):**  way you have to go about things in these sectors.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:25):**  One of the things Michael mentioned as well is like this focus on impact has meant more  
**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:29):**  LPs or more investors for venture capital funds.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:33):**  And that's a whole interesting spectrum as well that we've had to navigate it.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:38):**  Some funds or some investors just want impact as in ESG reporting and ways to adhere to  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:44):**  their compliance requirements, especially for larger institutional investors.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:48):**  The bar for impact is more of a compliance one than it is a alignment to the sector or  
**[0:34:54-0:34:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:54):**  delivering on a particular metric.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:56):**  Whereas on the other end of the spectrum, you'll have individuals or family offices  
**[0:34:59-0:35:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:34:59):**  who are much more focused on like, how are you reporting on this impact?  
**[0:35:02-0:35:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:02):**  How do you make sure that their mission doesn't creep over time?

**[0:35:07-0:35:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:07):**  And that is fantastic from an alignment to the sector, but has its own challenges, but  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:10):**  it has its own challenges because in an early stage company, your business model might change,  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:16):**  your customers might change, your product might change.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:18):**  And so how much can you as an investor mandate a certain kind of reporting or a certain metric  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:23):**  when these companies are on a journey where a lot of things are going to change and that's  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:27):**  actually what we want them to do as they do the work to discover what's actually going  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:30):**  to scale.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:31):**  We asked a similar question to Mark Kahn, who is investing in ag tech in India with  
**[0:35:36-0:35:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:36):**  Omnivore Partners.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:38):**  What it's meant is much more money for the ecosystem, the ability for companies to scale  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:42):**  up and rising valuations.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:48):**  Definitely not bad things for early stage investors like us, but sometimes generalists  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:56):**  have their own biases.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:35:57):**  They like outputs and market linkages more than inputs.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:02):**  They dislike fintech, certainly farmer facing fintech and that's been a more of a challenge.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:07):**  So they bring their own biases, which to be clear are informed from their experience working  
**[0:36:14-0:36:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:14):**  on other parts of the Indian economy.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:16):**  And sometimes that's a good thing and sometimes that's challenging, but it's certainly something  
**[0:36:20-0:36:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:20):**  that we have to deal with.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:21):**  That's something we've had to deal with a little bit too, Matthew, being a sector specific  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:25):**  investor and looking at businesses where we automatically know something's not going to  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:29):**  work or we've looked at that space and debunked an approach for one reason or another, and  
**[0:36:33-0:36:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:33):**  then seeing other investors who aren't sector specific kind of pile in to those areas.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:39):**  It's like the Rumsfeldian hierarchy, right?  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:42):**  Like I think the conviction that we have is known knowns.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:46):**  Like we have confidence doing what we do and confidence saying no to things where we've  
**[0:36:51-0:36:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:51):**  got well-formed hypotheses.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:52):**  And I think that's maybe that's the kind of definition of that Mark was talking about  
**[0:36:56-0:37:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:36:56):**  there, which is as a sector specific investor, you can be confident or have confidence in  
**[0:37:03-0:37:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:03):**  saying yes to something.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:04):**  You can have confidence in saying no to something for the reasons you were saying no.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:08):**  Doesn't mean that there aren't investments that you might pass on, you know, that other  
**[0:37:13-0:37:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:13):**  investors or general investors can get there.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:15):**  So I think the net result being more, you talked about more money being available, clearly  
**[0:37:21-0:37:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:21):**  a good thing.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:22):**  The net result of the pressure on valuation is something that can be a good and can be  
**[0:37:26-0:37:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:26):**  a bad thing.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:27):**  There are benefits and challenges with the cycles that early stage kind of cut the valuations  
**[0:37:31-0:37:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:31):**  go through.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:32):**  So I think the, yeah, that sort of pushing into that idea of the difference between kind  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:39):**  of sector specific investing and that we talked about before from the founder point of view,  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:44):**  what work can you see that this investor has done in forming hypotheses the year, how are  
**[0:37:49-0:37:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:49):**  they testing them?  
**[0:37:50-0:37:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:50):**  How does that align with what you want to do?  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:52):**  Some of those probably are just about how can you get to a yes or a no faster, right?  
**[0:37:57-0:38:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:37:57):**  Those are really important considerations from the investor point of view and from the  
**[0:38:01-0:38:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:01):**  founder point of view is eventually like money in someone else's bank account is no good  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:07):**  to your business.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:08):**  And so, you know, working out how you can get to a yes or get to a no faster is exploring  
**[0:38:14-0:38:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:14):**  this territory.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:15):**  Are they sector specific?  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:16):**  Are they general as to what do we need to talk about?  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:19):**  How do we need to talk about ourselves to be a match for what they're looking for, how  
**[0:38:25-0:38:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:25):**  they're going to evaluate us?  
**[0:38:26-0:38:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:26):**  And I think actually a couple of the founders touch on things like that as well.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:29):**  So I think from both sides that that kind of works as a, as an area to really focus  
**[0:38:34-0:38:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:34):**  on how can we get to a yes or a no faster.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:38):**  And Mark's other point around the benefit to seed stage investors is for those of us  
**[0:38:42-0:38:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:42):**  who are sector specific or in those early stages, we absolutely need other investors  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:45):**  to back these companies and for founders to find great partners for those later stages  
**[0:38:50-0:38:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:50):**  of the journey.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:51):**  So part of what we been focusing on is like, how do we build those partnerships?  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:38:55):**  How do we build those bridges to downstream funds and help them understand what's challenging  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:00):**  about food and ag, but then what's super exciting and how to think about different channels  
**[0:39:04-0:39:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:04):**  and what's worked in the past and what hasn't.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:06):**  So I've really enjoyed over the past couple of years, talking to these other investors  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:10):**  around like why food and ag and how to get comfortable with the early stages or with  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:15):**  the impact that, that food and ag is really able to unlock because we need it to do less  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:20):**  bad in the world, but we also have opportunities for food and ag to provide solutions to decarbonize  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:25):**  the rest of the economy.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:26):**  And investors really need to understand that.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:28):**  Yeah, I find that part super exciting, right?  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:30):**  Like the enthusiasm that Michael and Mark both had about welcoming in other investors,  
**[0:39:36-0:39:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:36):**  like you hear smack talk almost in other parts of venture where it sounds really competitive  
**[0:39:42-0:39:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:42):**  and almost a bit cutthroat.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:43):**  And we just don't experience that.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:45):**  And so that, that kind of collaborative nature and the welcoming in of new sources of capital  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:50):**  maybe when there's trillions and trillions of dollars available to ag and climate founders,  
**[0:39:55-0:39:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:55):**  I'll feel different, leave it right now.  
**[0:39:57-0:39:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:57):**  I'm full of enthusiasm for all this additional capital coming in.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:39:59):**  We've talked a little bit about COVID and a little bit about climate capital coming  
**[0:40:04-0:40:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:40:04):**  in.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:40:05):**  One of the other changes that has happened in last year is the entrance of new forms  
**[0:40:09-0:40:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:40:09):**  of exits like SPACs, which is something that Michael also commented on.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:40:12):**  We have had a few examples of things that haven't quite gone to plan.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:40:15):**  One of those relates to SPACs or special purpose acquisition companies.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:40:20):**  And whilst they've been seen as a really positive development for ag tech, which has struggled  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:40:25):**  for quite a while to identify where the exits are going to come from.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:40:28):**  And of course, deliver returns to investors.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:40:31):**  There are definite risks to the public markets, particularly in the ag tech space.

**[0:41:12-0:41:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:41:12):**  on the share price.

**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:41:21):**  That's such an important point that Michael's making there.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:41:25):**  If you think explaining a complex business to a professional investor is hard, try explaining  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:41:30):**  it to the public markets.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:41:31):**  I just think that there's macro cycles to consider there as well.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:41:37):**  But in the end, Michael's 100% right in terms of you've got to constantly provide digestible,

**[0:42:02-0:42:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:02):**  and getting dirty.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:03):**  I think there is a degree of risk there around a fundamental impedance mismatch between industrially  
**[0:42:09-0:42:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:09):**  specific complex businesses and public markets.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:14):**  And whilst that kind of stack window, like in terms of financial engineering technology,  
**[0:42:21-0:42:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:21):**  it's an interesting innovation.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:22):**  But in the end, you're a public vehicle and you've got to keep the public markets fed  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:26):**  with morsels of easily digested information.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:32):**  And if you're a growing business in a complex area, man, I think you've jumped from the  
**[0:42:38-0:42:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:38):**  frying pan into the fire.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:40):**  And it goes back to what some of the founders said around both communicating to investors,  
**[0:42:44-0:42:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:44):**  but keeping focused on what are the fundamentals of the business?  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:48):**  How do we build value here?  
**[0:42:49-0:42:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:49):**  What are the unlock codes that we need to be doubling down on?  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:52):**  And yeah, Mark said that as well in terms of how he's supporting his portfolio companies  
**[0:42:56-0:42:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:56):**  around what to stay focused on.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:42:58):**  I think in general, just keeping our founders focused on product market fit and not chasing  
**[0:43:04-0:43:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:43:04):**  vanity metrics is very important.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:43:07):**  I think that's great advice, but pretty hard to execute depending on where you are.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:43:13):**  So the idea that like when we use this phrase of vanity metric, I think that's true from  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:43:20):**  someone's perspective.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:43:22):**  When you say like something that we're choosing about ourselves to pump our own tires up,  
**[0:43:27-0:43:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:43:27):**  that's not quite the same as presenting the information that the receiver is expecting.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:43:33):**  They're trying to fit you into a template.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:43:35):**  And so rather than do the work of properly understand your business and properly understanding  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:43:41):**  what represents success for you, we also get trapped into this idea of packaging up information  
**[0:43:46-0:43:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:43:46):**  in a way that other people already understand it.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:43:50):**  And it's appealing because it's a shortcut, but it's high risk because you're really not  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:43:56):**  accepting and actually goes back to one of the previous founder quotes about being open  
**[0:44:01-0:44:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:01):**  and honest about the true risks in your business.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:03):**  I think when you putting up substitute metrics, you're risking hiding too much complexity.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:10):**  You're risking making it too easy for someone to think of you one way when really you're  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:15):**  another and that's not likely to last.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:19):**  Matthew, you've raised money a couple of times, both obviously for Tenacious Ventures Fund  
**[0:44:25-0:44:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:25):**  one, but also with Observin and in your past lives.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:30):**  Any of these founder quotes or investor quotes bring particularly true for you and your experience  
**[0:44:35-0:44:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:35):**  or any stories that come to mind from scars you may or may not have?  
**[0:44:39-0:44:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:39):**  Well the first company I was a co-founder of was actually acquired by a newly minted  
**[0:44:43-0:44:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:43):**  NASDAQ IPO company and it was nuts.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:47):**  We had worked with them maybe for six months.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:49):**  They were a customer first and then they acquired us.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:52):**  So we had worked with them for a decent period before they went public and then after they  
**[0:44:56-0:44:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:56):**  went public, it was literally like walking into a different company.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:44:59):**  The rhythm of the company had changed.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:02):**  The focus of the company was entirely focused around this crazy quarterly cycle of providing  
**[0:45:09-0:45:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:09):**  information to the market and it had a really negative impact on product development.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:14):**  It just unnecessarily, now that was early days and it was dot com and all kind of stuff.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:20):**  So probably you got a bunch of reasons why there's a much better understanding, but I  
**[0:45:24-0:45:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:24):**  think just that's especially tragic to have a high potential company that all of a sudden  
**[0:45:29-0:45:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:29):**  their ability to make progress has sort of been thwarted or impeded by the very thing  
**[0:45:36-0:45:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:36):**  that you were sort of hoping to do as an unlock.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:39):**  So I think that kind of to me is one kind of thing to draw out here, which is really  
**[0:45:43-0:45:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:43):**  understanding the source of capital and how tapping into that source of capital is going  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:50):**  to deliver for what you really need to get done because money for the sake of money won't  
**[0:45:55-0:45:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:55):**  ever be worth it.  
**[0:45:57-0:45:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:57):**  That deal won't ever be worth doing.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:45:59):**  Which actually leads to why we wanted to do this episode.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:46:02):**  We've had some of our founders, we've seen them raising, we've seen other raises, we've  
**[0:46:07-0:46:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:46:07):**  talked on panels with other founders raising and noticing some of the differences in the  
**[0:46:12-0:46:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:46:12):**  climate tech space with more money coming in there and how that contrasts with generalist  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:46:16):**  VCs, but then also software businesses versus more deep tech companies, whether that's food  
**[0:46:21-0:46:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:46:21):**  and manufacturing or hardware.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:46:23):**  So I think that was one of the big stimuluses to reach out to the folks in our network and  
**[0:46:29-0:46:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:46:29):**  get some thoughts on what it's been like to raise over the past couple of years.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:46:32):**  The reflection for us is specific to the stage that we're currently at too, which is a lot  
**[0:46:38-0:46:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:46:38):**  of our time with mostly constructed portfolio has actually been in helping founders move  
**[0:46:44-0:46:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:46:44):**  on to that next stage of investment.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:46:46):**  And that sort of investor to investor contact with their downstream is actually quite different  
**[0:46:51-0:47:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:46:51):**  than co-investor contact and the sort of understanding of how can you help package up these complex  
**[0:47:01-0:47:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:47:01):**  ideas in a way that results in the additional funding, the deeper impact, the broader penetration.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:47:12):**  We talked about timeframes and I think here the knowing the difference between something  
**[0:47:19-0:47:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/3/31/agtech-fundraising-vc-investing#t=0:47:19):**  that's reactionary in nature versus something that feels persistent is really important.

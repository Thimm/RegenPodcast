### Agtech - So What?  (2020-11-04)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast, brought to you by Agthentic. I'm your host,  Sarah Nolet. In this episode, we take you to a large Australian grazing station, which  200 years ago developed the Saxon Merino sheep, known for its fine, bright wool. Now it's  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:00:21):**  again at the forefront of innovation in agriculture. In the last 10 years, they have been pushing  the envelope across the operation, from leadership, training and goal setting, to genetics and  genomics to data and software. And they're getting some promising results, but it hasn't  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:00:37):**  always been easy or without pushback. You can imagine what some of these guys thought.  They were like, oh my God, this, you know, you lot are going crazy, you know. And I used  to get comments like, you know, you can't use a computer to breed sheep. That's Matt  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:00:53):**  Crozier, General Manager of Cavan Station, a 9,900 hectare aggregation of properties  on the southern tablelands of New South Wales, about an hour outside of Canberra. These days,  Cavan Station is owned by the Murdoch family. I was lucky enough to visit Cavan recently  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:01:10):**  myself and meet with Matt, who has led the farm through a pretty impressive transformation  over the last 10 years. We start with Matt's story of how he ended up in charge of one  of Australia's most significant farming enterprises. I come from originally a little town called  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:01:26):**  Bungendore, which is east of Canberra, between Canberra and Batemans Bay. I did my schooling  in Canberra and then I did a bit of time at Ag College at both Wagga and then the correspondence  at Orange Ag College. I had Jackeroot out in the Riverina. And then I went home to a  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:01:41):**  family farm, which was at Bungendore, worked with my father for a while. And then sort  of in about my late 20s, I had the opportunity to go to Sydney and work in the financial  markets. I had friends that were working up there and I ended up being a futures trader  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:01:56):**  for about 5 or 6-years, trading interest rates, markets, bonds and bills and things like that,  some agricultural futures. And then I always sort of knew I wanted to drift back to being  on the land. So that corresponded with my father wanting to retire. So I sort of went  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:02:12):**  home to the family property, which was not quite big enough to be viable at that stage.  So I was doing a few other things, which was a lot of contracting and sort of fencing and  weed spraying. And then I kind of got into a bit of sort of management for a few absentee  
**[0:02:28-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:02:28):**  owners. Then I sort of formed more of a management company where I had sort of 3 or 4 farms on  management contracts that I was looking after for people. And then out of that, I kind of  got the opportunity to come to Cavern. A new role opened up here and it sort of seemed  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:02:48):**  sensible to me that it was a good challenge coming here, but also it sort of meant that  I was running 9 farms in the one spot instead of 4 farms all over the place and for different  clients. So I only had one client to worry about here. So yeah, it's been all good.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:03:03):**  Yeah, fair enough. Did you have a kind of management philosophy at that time? Like were  people coming to you to look after their farms because you did it in a certain way?  I think that was definitely evolving, but obviously I've always had a sort of a, for  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:03:18):**  want of a better word, a sort of a regenerative bent in that I've always focused on planned  sort of rotational grazing and improving the capital value of assets through kind of ecological  improvement as much as focusing on yield. And I think that resonated with a lot of clients.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:03:39):**  Did you call it regenerative? Like is that the term that was used or is that you said  for lack of a better word? No, because that wasn't really the term.  No, yeah. So I mean, that wasn't really the, you know, when I started out in this sort  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:03:49):**  of journey 20 years ago, people didn't really use that term. So I think at the time that  we were sort of considered as sort of holistic managers or sell grazers, but we thought it  was the same philosophy. We really wanted to improve the ecosystems that we're running  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:05):**  and the landscapes that we were looking after. You know, it was around tree planting and  fencing out gullies and rectifying erosion, those sorts of things were always things we're  trying to do 20 years ago and it remains the same today.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:18):**  And was that because it was good profitability or environmental outcomes or like philosophy  of the manager or owner? Like what were the drivers behind that?  Look, I think humans intrinsically, whether you're a manager or an owner, you're always  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:32):**  wanting to leave the land in better shape than when you take it on. You know, that's  just a fundamental human kind of interest of improving things and making them better.  So look, I think we were doing it for the, because it seemed like the right thing to  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:47):**  do, but it also, it did have production and sort of management benefits as well. You know,  by doing tree planting, we were creating more shelter for livestock and we were getting  better landing results and the synergies are there in everything we do.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:05:02):**  In typical Aussie farmer style, Matt is really downplaying just how significant the transformation  at Cavan has been. When he took on the role as manager in 2010, the station was basically  a lot of rundown family farms that had been cobbled together and the region had just been  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:05:20):**  through a long, tough drought. Yes, the business really was showing the effects  of being quite knocked around through that 10 year period of really below average seasons.  Then we sort of had the task of then trying to run these assets as a big operating station  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:05:40):**  and we didn't kind of have the infrastructure right to do that. So really it was a building  phase of just getting the management systems right so that we could run the place efficiently.  So initially it was about writing a business plan for the first five years about just getting  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:05:57):**  the place operating properly. So that was just getting infrastructure in. We couldn't  do the grazing management we wanted to do because we didn't have the right fencing,  we didn't have enough water. So the first five years of my life, I really just oversaw  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:10):**  big capital improvements, capex expenditure on fencing and reticulated water systems and  new shearing sheds and better yard designs and yard set ups for both sheep and cattle.  So that was the first five years and that was a big challenge. Then when we got to the  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:26):**  point where we kind of had it under control and we had our basic management systems in,  we built a really good team of people. We then were able to sit down and really write  a business plan for the next five years, which we've just completed and kind of had a bit  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:40):**  of an internal review process around how we've gone. And that's been the fun bit because  that's been able to, where we've been able to just utilise the infrastructure and the  management we had to really feel like we've made some sort of ecological and production  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:53):**  gains. Was it a lot of pressure to, like when you're  making all those capex improvements to kind of think about, okay, we got to get a return  on this. Like it's, there's some pressure here now that we're spending all this money.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:07:05):**  Look it is always a pressure spending someone else's money, there's no doubt. But look,  no, I'd had a fair bit of experience in that. I had taken on sort of underperforming assets  quite a bit in the past. That was probably, as far as the things that I liked that made  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:07:20):**  me tick as sort of the change management thing. So I've always sort of sought out those challenges.  So I had done a fair bit of kind of capex improvement on other properties I'd run. So  I knew how to kind of account for that. What's been interesting at Cavan is monitoring over  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:07:35):**  time sort of the rate of expenditure. And it's incredible to know that we've, I think  on average, we've only spent about $90 a hectare in all the improvements in fencing and water.  So it's not hard to work out that we're getting a considerable payback from that investment  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:07:51):**  when you see sort of like our increases in dry matter yield now because of our ability  to graze the country better and utilise pastures better.  You mentioned the team. Tell us about the team and like one of the, I guess, hard things  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:05):**  is getting everyone on board to make some of those changes. Tell us a little bit about  that.  Yeah, that's been the biggest part of the journey in the last five years has just been  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:16):**  the human element. So, and the human change and, you know, mindset. So we've got a fairly  big team here, kind of 10 or 12 people in various roles from sort of operational managers,  lab manager, you know, down to overseas, station hands. And a lot of them are very experienced  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:34):**  people that have had a lot of time in the industry. They're very good stockmen. But  when you sort of said to them, okay, now what we want you to do is pick up a computer and  start generating some data for us that we can use to make better decisions, you know,  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:49):**  that really didn't come naturally to them initially. So one was sort of about getting  the philosophy right around some of the principles of grazing. The other thing was, you know,  giving them the tools and then giving them the training to use those tools to kind of  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:09:04):**  get the outcomes we wanted. And the fabulous part is that I can sit back now after five  years and say we've been actually relatively successful at that. I'm amazed at the team's  ability to come on the journey with us. It started out, we probably put them all through  
**[0:09:20-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:09:20):**  a lot of training initially. So we sent them off to, you know, Grazing for Profit. They've  done other grazing modules. Some of them have done natural sequence farming courses. They've  done low stress stock handling courses. You name it, we've given them the opportunity  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:09:38):**  to do that. And I think that's helped a lot.  Tell me about the kind of use of more data and digital. Like I'm imagining for some of  these stockmen going out and saying like, all right, we're going to enter all this information  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:09:50):**  and you're going to use all this tech. Like there was maybe a bit of pushback. How did  that, like, do you have any stories about that?  Yeah, yeah. Initially there was, you know, guys that they couldn't send a text message  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:02):**  on their phone. And we were saying here, we're downloading this program called My Grazing  onto your phone. And every time you move stock or every time you check the rain gauge, you're  going to have to put something in here. You can imagine what some of these guys thought.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:16):**  They were like, oh my God, you know, you're a lot of going crazy. You know, you know,  you used to get comments like, you know, you can't use a computer to breed sheep, you know,  all those sorts of things. But look, no, people embraced it pretty well. I mean, you know,  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:30):**  people are particularly the team we've got, they all want to improve all the time. And  they want to help the business and they can see the benefits. So they're willing to learn.  I mean, some of them, we've had to start with really, really basic computing type assistance.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:47):**  We purchased a lot, you know, a few iPads and that sort of thing, which people could  carry in their ute because some of them, their fingers were too big to operate. The mobile  phone was too small, you know, so they were much more comfortable with an iPad that they  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:59):**  could carry in the ute and they could get in there and do the moves on it. But no, everyone's  got to come to terms with it.  Other than training, which I want to come back to you and the kind of return on investment  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:10):**  of that, because you could say, oh, that's expensive or maybe not everyone has access  to that. Is there anything else that you did to get people on board or kind of help people  go through that change in mindset?  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:22):**  I think it's just chipping away at it week by week, day by day. Just, you know, it's  just about having a really consistent message. And I was helped, you know, I recruited a  guy as my sort of two IC Tom Deary, who has really helped in the journey with that too.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:38):**  He's got a sort of quiet disposition, but he's doggedly determined. So he was very good  in assisting me delivering that consistent message to staff. So, you know, every time  there was a conversation about, you know, why are we doing this? Or, you know, what's  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:51):**  the point of it? Or this is just extra work, you know, he and I were able to, you know,  always answer those sort of queries and concerns and just keep chipping away and heading in  the right direction.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:03):**  Yeah. How much did you use kind of metrics as well to show the improvement? Like I imagine  over a bit of time, you could start to get buy-in because things were working or you  could see the benefits. Did you guys use data with the team or was that more kind of reporting  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:18):**  up in management and to owners?  No, no, we used the data internally as well. So particularly that say, I can think of a  few examples. One classic example is the forecasting tool in my grazing. So to be able to kind  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:34):**  of just go, you know, if the team are coming to you with concerns going, look, we really  think we're, you know, we're doing our feed budgeting. We think we're running out of feed.  We can pull up that forecasting tool and we could run a scenario and say, okay guys, what  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:48):**  if we get only 25% of our average rainfall for the next 6 months? What are we going to  look like then with this number of stock? Or, you know, we are selling those sheep and  those cattle. If we put in those sales and we have a reduced rainfall, what's the outcome?  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:02):**  What does that look like? There's a lot of debate originally and you know, still is today  about accuracy of feed budgeting, you know, with having so many different members of the  team. We've got 8 or 9 guys going out and doing feed budgeting every month and obviously  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:14):**  they all look through a slightly different set of eyes. So having the data all the time  so that they can use that as a reference to sort of calibrate their feed budgeting skills.  We have team meetings where we catch up definitely annually and quite often a few times throughout  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:32):**  the year where we just, we do pull a bit of data and sort of present it to them because  it means that they can see what it's all about, you know, that it's been worthwhile. They  can see that the energy of putting that, you know, rubbish in is rubbish out if you like.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:45):**  The quality of the data going in is important for the quality of data that's coming out  to enable them to make better decisions.  Matt and his team also use the latest technology to run their Merino stud, including genomics  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:58):**  and DNA parent testing. And if you're not across genomics, don't worry, you're about  to hear a really good explanation.  Okay, so genomics is basically gene markers that can be, you know, assessed through DNA  
**[0:14:13-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:14:13):**  and then compared against an extensive reference flock. So you can sort of take a group of  animals, you know, maybe you've got 100 ewes or something, you can just take a TSU or a  tissue sample, have it sent away for analysis and those 100 sheep can be ranked for particular  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:14:32):**  traits from one to 100. So it might be, you know, wool cut or micron simply off the genetic  markers compared against that reference flock, they can rank those animals as being, you  know, the finest to the broadest and the heaviest cutter to the lightest cutter.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:14:48):**  So that backs up and it actually adds accuracy to breeding values, you know, that are being  generated. So the accuracy of breeding values has improved dramatically as we've got full  pedigree through DNA parentage and also backed up against the reference flock sort of utilising  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:15:06):**  genomics. So, yeah, look, that's sort of the pointy end of the genetics in the business.  And obviously as a stud where, you know, we're supplying clients with genetics, so it's very  important that we, you know, maximising our rate of genetic gain all the time.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:15:25):**  One of the goals you guys set out from the case study around improving land mortality  and around ceasing mulesing, tell me about why you set those goals, when you set them  and what the reaction was like from the team.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:15:37):**  Yeah, so that has been an interesting journey too. So we sort of sat down five years ago,  it was actually probably longer, and we sort of said that we thought that the consumer  was very interested or getting more and more interested in the sort of the ethics behind  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:15:57):**  the way products are produced. That was definitely happening with food and we felt that it was  going to happen with fibre as well. So as wool producers, we wanted to be as proactive  as we could be around opening up as many markets as possible and, you know, hopefully having  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:16:12):**  a pretty good story to tell and through that story, you know, hopefully being able to attract  a bit of a premium in the marketplace because, you know, we knew we had a pretty good product.  So one of the things that we felt was holding us back was mulesing. Definitely from an animal  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:16:26):**  welfare point of view, it was, I mean, I'm not here to judge, you know, to debate the  pros and cons. I'm just saying that from our perspective as a business, we felt that there  was a lot of consumers out there saying that they would prefer to buy non-mules wool. So  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:16:42):**  we thought, well, how can we position our business to have the highest animal welfare  credentials as possible? So it was kind of my decision from a board level that that was  the path we wanted to go down. And then it was about bringing the team on board with,  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:16:57):**  you know, the guys that were out there actually having to manage the sheep. A lot of them  were quite traditional in their mindset around animal health and they were very, very concerned  about the concept of ceasing mulesing because of obviously worried about fly strike.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:13):**  I think it's probably fair to say all sheep farmers feel fly strike on some level and  many can probably recall at least one horror season. That's why Matt initially had a hard  time convincing his team that not mulesing was a good idea.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:26):**  Yeah, well, it was tough. It was stressful. I kind of said, look, this decision's been  made at the top and now we've got to work out how to make it happen. And a couple of  them said, well, if we get to the point where we've got sheep everywhere that aren't mules,  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:39):**  well, I'm going to go and work somewhere else. That was the sort of level of pushback we  had initially. And there's no point sort of directly arguing with that. So what we did  is we just went away and collected data and gave all sorts of examples of people that  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:52):**  had already done this. We worked out the sort of data that we had to collect to achieve  our goal and that was really around breach wrinkle data and bear area data. So we started  collecting all that and I kind of explained to the staff that this was going to take time.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:18:08):**  It wasn't like we were going to go cold turkey and cease tomorrow. I think we set a goal  of about sort of four to five years and we actually ended up achieving that goal within  three years. So we were ahead of schedule. The staff have taken it on board pretty well.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:18:23):**  So far so good. It's been working okay. I think there is still some concern in the team  that with a very wet spring this year, we might run into a few more problems than we  have in the last couple of years. But I think it's really about management. I always say  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:18:41):**  to clients that ask me about managing unmilled sheep, I say, well, you can't manage them  the same as milled sheep. You have to have a different mindset. So you've just got to  be more proactive with applications and sometimes they need an extra crutch, but just got to  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:18:55):**  be on the ball. When they need a drench, they get a drench. You can't be sort of too slack  with your timings. But we are attracting market premiums now, which is well and truly compensating  us for that extra cost in production through that extra bit of management.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:19:10):**  Yeah, great. Some of the things you mentioned, Matt, seem maybe from the outside like they're  expensive and you guys have been fortunate to have resources at your disposal, but do  you feel like, what's your pushback when people say, oh, you've had the resources to do this  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:19:26):**  that maybe other people don't? Has it been profitable? Would you kind of justify the  expense and say that there's been a good return?  Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Yeah. Look, I mean, there is that opinion in some of the  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:19:41):**  community that sort of say, well, because of the nature of your operation or who the  owners are, you don't have to try as hard as other farmers, but that's actually just  not true. We get no external support in this business. Everything that we do here, we generate  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:19:57):**  internally. If we want to build a new shearing shed or buy a new tractor, well, we generate  the income to do that. So everything we do is just like a normal farm. Everything we  do, we have to account for the return on investment. So the mules thing really didn't cost a lot  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:20:15):**  of money. It was just about being smart and it was about taking time. It can be done in  any business. I know that people are at different points in the curve as far as some sheep are  genetically more suitable than other sheep. And we're in the fortunate position that Malcolm  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:20:32):**  Peake, the stud manager, had been working on breeding planar and planar sheep for many  years. So we were in a fairly good starting point when we made the decision to head down  the non-mules path. But it's just about collecting data and then using the data to make decisions.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:20:47):**  So by collecting all that breech wrinkle data and body wrinkle data and bare area data,  we were able to build that into a custom index. So when we were selecting animals to use in  the stud, you know, stud size, we were finding those animals that were suitable to be non-mules  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:21:04):**  that had, you know, low wrinkle scores, but were also hitting all their other production  KPIs. So we felt we were doing it, we were making the change over time without losing  production. And that's been very important. It's been a very important message to clients  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:21:19):**  especially.  It's not just about listening to the data at Cavin Station. It's also about listening  to the staff.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:21:26):**  Yeah. So we had some outside help with that to put that, we basically have a staff sort  of engagement survey that we have put together, which the staff filled out anonymously. And  it had a range of questions and a range of sort of metrics it was trying to measure just  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:21:44):**  about whether people felt empowered to be able to do their job. You know, did they feel  like they were supported in the things they were doing? Did they feel like they had opportunities  to improve? Did they feel like they had everything they needed to do their job? Did they feel  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:22:01):**  like they were being listened to? You know, a whole range of sort of questions like that.  And yeah, no, I was very happy to, you know, in the most recent one, very happy to see  that we kind of, I think our score was about 4.3 out of five or something like that, which  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:22:14):**  was great. We've also had very, very little staff turnover here. Basically had no one  turnover in the last four or five years, which has been great.  Even with all those changes, why do you think that is?  
**[0:22:28-0:22:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:22:28):**  That's a very good question, Sarah. I think maybe not such a bad place to work. Maybe  I'm not such a bad boss after all.  Is there anything that you would do differently looking back on all these changes?  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:22:44):**  No, I think, I mean, I think what we've done and the way we've done it has been good. I  think, you know, sometimes you feel through the process that you're not getting there  quick enough, but when you kind of get to where we've got now, you look back, you then  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:00):**  think, well, things take as long as they take. We're obviously, there's still plenty to do.  There's still plenty of improvement to be made from here on. It's not like we've got  all the answers. It's definitely a journey of constant, you know, constant improvement.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:15):**  And we feel like it's still fairly early days, but you know, we are kicking some goals and  we can sense that from the data.  No, no mistakes or kind of oops, you know, that was a mess along the way, like things  
**[0:23:27-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:27):**  like that, that are good lessons you learned?  I mean, we've obviously had to manage a couple of really horrid drought years in the middle  of all this. And there has been some moments throughout that where we probably could have  
**[0:23:41-0:23:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:41):**  managed things better. You know, I think it was a vastly improved management style we  took into this drought than what was taken into the last drought. However, I think we  could have still been maybe slightly more timely in some of our decisions. I think we  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:56):**  were kind of, we were learning on the run a little bit. I think, you know, it would  have been better if this horrible drought had come along, you know, if we had a couple  more years of sort of getting ready, we might've managed it even better. So we'll probably  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:09):**  be in a better position for the next one.  Look, you know, the other thing we've used through the drought is containment feeding  areas. And that was another thing that we really had to analyse heavily to see whether  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:21):**  it fitted into our kind of animal welfare ethics. A lot of the staff had some real concerns  about that. They felt that, you know, maybe that wasn't going to fit into what we were  trying to do as far as animal welfare. So we did, there again, we went off and did some  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:35):**  training and utilised, you know, we went and visited people that were doing it, saw it  in action, had consultants from DPI come in and talk to us about how to do it. And we  basically decided that if we had to, if we're going to do it, we had to do it a hundred  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:50):**  percent correctly. And we did, and it was a great success. So we were kind of building  that infrastructure as the drought was upon us, you know, so next time we'll be better  prepared again.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:03):**  Sure. And tell me about what's next when you look at the next five years, do you have some  specific goals that you've set or where do you want to be?  Yeah, look, I think, you know, from an ecological point of view, it's still a lot of monitoring.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:16):**  There's obviously a lot of tree planting. We've got a lot of interest in more natural  sequence farming projects, but from a sort of, from a grazing management point of view,  we feel like we've made really good inroads, but we still not at the point where we're  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:31):**  able to get enough density in our graze at times. So that can only be improved by either  bigger mobs or smaller paddocks. So we've kind of committed to still reducing the average  size of our paddocks down by, you know, another 15 to 20% over the next five years, which  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:49):**  will obviously involve more reticulated water as well. So things are going really well,  but we would like to see our graze periods just a little bit shorter and our rest periods  just a little bit longer and that density, because we feel we're going to make just greater  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:26:05):**  landscape change by getting that density a bit better. So those are the sort of things  we're working towards. They're not massive changes from what we're doing, but we're just  going to be doing it all better. We are moving towards, you know, we think we're probably  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:26:22):**  carbon neutral already, but we want to make sure we are. So we're going to get impact  tagged to do a survey into where we're at in that neck of the woods. And we also looking  towards possibly, because we are sequestering carbon in our business, we want to hopefully,  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:26:39):**  if market conditions are right, maybe attract another stream of income from carbon sometime  over the next five years as well. Some of these things are, I would say, maybe  controversial or things that get pushed back, you know, regenerative, carbon neutral, non-mules.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:26:56):**  Do you, like, I don't know, what are the conversations like at the pub or with your neighbours? I  know I posted a picture of when I was out at Kevin and there was a good amount of thistle  in that picture and I had a few people asking me about, you know, weeds and what was happening.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:08):**  How do you kind of deal with personally that that may be pushed back?  Yeah, look, it's always there. It's always there. We are, you know, we do do things differently  to a lot of the neighbours, some of the neighbours. And there is a community perception because  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:23):**  we're a fairly big operation, you know, there is a bit of talk in the community around what's  going on out at Kevin. I think the weeds thing is an interesting one. I think, you know,  people driving past Kevin at the moment, you know, probably going, oh, look at all those  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:37):**  weeds. But, you know, for the last two years when the district's been in drought, they've  probably been driving past Kevin going, wow, look how good Kevin looks because look at  all that ground cover, you know, and they've got grass and no one else has. So, you know,  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:49):**  look, it's all swings and roundabouts. So don't let it worry me too much. You know,  we're on the journey we're on and we've got very good reasons why. And I'm happy to discuss  any of those sort of reasons with anyone that wants to listen. You know, like the weed thing,  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:28:04):**  we sort of feel that covered up ground is better than bare ground. We think that that'll  come back into balance as we get our grazing management right. We feel that, you know,  nature puts plants in places for a reason. There's a reason why, you know, sometimes  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:28:18):**  as thistle's growing, they're a great coloniser and, you know, they're building organic carbon  and, you know, the next phase will be a grass phase that comes through, you know. Let's  just say we've got a lot of clover around and, you know, all that clover is fixing nitrogen  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:28:31):**  and, you know, from the nitrogen grass will grow. So it's all cyclical. Yeah, so, you  know, the perceptions of, you know, outsiders into our business, you know, it is something  that we like to engage with when we can, but really you've just got to get on and run the  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:28:47):**  business the way you think it needs to be run. Yeah, but a thick skin as well maybe?  Yeah, a little bit, yeah. Matt, what's the biggest thing you've personally  learned maybe about yourself or yourself as a leader or manager?  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:29:03):**  Yeah, I think, you know, I think the people management, the leadership just simply through  communication, you know, leading by example, believing what you, you know, what you, the  message you're delivering you have to believe in and then just communication, you know,

### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 04 Nov 2020 19:01:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast, brought to you by Agthentic. I'm your host,  
**[0:00:08-0:00:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:00:08):**  Sarah Nolet. In this episode, we take you to a large Australian grazing station, which  
**[0:00:14-0:00:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:00:14):**  200 years ago developed the Saxon Merino sheep, known for its fine, bright wool. Now it's  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:00:21):**  again at the forefront of innovation in agriculture. In the last 10 years, they have been pushing  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:00:26):**  the envelope across the operation, from leadership, training and goal setting, to genetics and  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:00:31):**  genomics to data and software. And they're getting some promising results, but it hasn't  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:00:37):**  always been easy or without pushback. You can imagine what some of these guys thought.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:00:42):**  They were like, oh my God, this, you know, you lot are going crazy, you know. And I used  
**[0:00:47-0:00:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:00:47):**  to get comments like, you know, you can't use a computer to breed sheep. That's Matt  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:00:53):**  Crozier, General Manager of Cavan Station, a 9,900 hectare aggregation of properties  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:00:59):**  on the southern tablelands of New South Wales, about an hour outside of Canberra. These days,  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:01:05):**  Cavan Station is owned by the Murdoch family. I was lucky enough to visit Cavan recently  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:01:10):**  myself and meet with Matt, who has led the farm through a pretty impressive transformation  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:01:14):**  over the last 10 years. We start with Matt's story of how he ended up in charge of one  
**[0:01:19-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:01:19):**  of Australia's most significant farming enterprises. I come from originally a little town called  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:01:26):**  Bungendore, which is east of Canberra, between Canberra and Batemans Bay. I did my schooling  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:01:30):**  in Canberra and then I did a bit of time at Ag College at both Wagga and then the correspondence  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:01:35):**  at Orange Ag College. I had Jackeroot out in the Riverina. And then I went home to a  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:01:41):**  family farm, which was at Bungendore, worked with my father for a while. And then sort  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:01:47):**  of in about my late 20s, I had the opportunity to go to Sydney and work in the financial  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:01:52):**  markets. I had friends that were working up there and I ended up being a futures trader  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:01:56):**  for about 5 or 6-years, trading interest rates, markets, bonds and bills and things like that,  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:02:02):**  some agricultural futures. And then I always sort of knew I wanted to drift back to being  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:02:08):**  on the land. So that corresponded with my father wanting to retire. So I sort of went  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:02:12):**  home to the family property, which was not quite big enough to be viable at that stage.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:02:17):**  So I was doing a few other things, which was a lot of contracting and sort of fencing and  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:02:23):**  weed spraying. And then I kind of got into a bit of sort of management for a few absentee  
**[0:02:28-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:02:28):**  owners. Then I sort of formed more of a management company where I had sort of 3 or 4 farms on  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:02:37):**  management contracts that I was looking after for people. And then out of that, I kind of  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:02:43):**  got the opportunity to come to Cavern. A new role opened up here and it sort of seemed  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:02:48):**  sensible to me that it was a good challenge coming here, but also it sort of meant that  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:02:53):**  I was running 9 farms in the one spot instead of 4 farms all over the place and for different  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:02:59):**  clients. So I only had one client to worry about here. So yeah, it's been all good.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:03:03):**  Yeah, fair enough. Did you have a kind of management philosophy at that time? Like were  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:03:08):**  people coming to you to look after their farms because you did it in a certain way?  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:03:13):**  I think that was definitely evolving, but obviously I've always had a sort of a, for  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:03:18):**  want of a better word, a sort of a regenerative bent in that I've always focused on planned  
**[0:03:24-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:03:24):**  sort of rotational grazing and improving the capital value of assets through kind of ecological  
**[0:03:31-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:03:31):**  improvement as much as focusing on yield. And I think that resonated with a lot of clients.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:03:39):**  Did you call it regenerative? Like is that the term that was used or is that you said  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:03:43):**  for lack of a better word? No, because that wasn't really the term.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:03:45):**  No, yeah. So I mean, that wasn't really the, you know, when I started out in this sort  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:03:49):**  of journey 20 years ago, people didn't really use that term. So I think at the time that  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:03:54):**  we were sort of considered as sort of holistic managers or sell grazers, but we thought it  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:00):**  was the same philosophy. We really wanted to improve the ecosystems that we're running  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:05):**  and the landscapes that we were looking after. You know, it was around tree planting and  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:09):**  fencing out gullies and rectifying erosion, those sorts of things were always things we're  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:14):**  trying to do 20 years ago and it remains the same today.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:18):**  And was that because it was good profitability or environmental outcomes or like philosophy  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:23):**  of the manager or owner? Like what were the drivers behind that?  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:27):**  Look, I think humans intrinsically, whether you're a manager or an owner, you're always  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:32):**  wanting to leave the land in better shape than when you take it on. You know, that's  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:36):**  just a fundamental human kind of interest of improving things and making them better.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:42):**  So look, I think we were doing it for the, because it seemed like the right thing to  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:47):**  do, but it also, it did have production and sort of management benefits as well. You know,  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:53):**  by doing tree planting, we were creating more shelter for livestock and we were getting  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:04:57):**  better landing results and the synergies are there in everything we do.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:05:02):**  In typical Aussie farmer style, Matt is really downplaying just how significant the transformation  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:05:09):**  at Cavan has been. When he took on the role as manager in 2010, the station was basically  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:05:14):**  a lot of rundown family farms that had been cobbled together and the region had just been  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:05:20):**  through a long, tough drought. Yes, the business really was showing the effects  
**[0:05:26-0:05:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:05:26):**  of being quite knocked around through that 10 year period of really below average seasons.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:05:34):**  Then we sort of had the task of then trying to run these assets as a big operating station  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:05:40):**  and we didn't kind of have the infrastructure right to do that. So really it was a building  
**[0:05:45-0:05:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:05:45):**  phase of just getting the management systems right so that we could run the place efficiently.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:05:52):**  So initially it was about writing a business plan for the first five years about just getting  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:05:57):**  the place operating properly. So that was just getting infrastructure in. We couldn't  
**[0:06:02-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:02):**  do the grazing management we wanted to do because we didn't have the right fencing,  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:05):**  we didn't have enough water. So the first five years of my life, I really just oversaw  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:10):**  big capital improvements, capex expenditure on fencing and reticulated water systems and  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:16):**  new shearing sheds and better yard designs and yard set ups for both sheep and cattle.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:21):**  So that was the first five years and that was a big challenge. Then when we got to the  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:26):**  point where we kind of had it under control and we had our basic management systems in,  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:31):**  we built a really good team of people. We then were able to sit down and really write  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:35):**  a business plan for the next five years, which we've just completed and kind of had a bit  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:40):**  of an internal review process around how we've gone. And that's been the fun bit because  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:44):**  that's been able to, where we've been able to just utilise the infrastructure and the  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:49):**  management we had to really feel like we've made some sort of ecological and production  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:53):**  gains. Was it a lot of pressure to, like when you're  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:06:57):**  making all those capex improvements to kind of think about, okay, we got to get a return  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:07:00):**  on this. Like it's, there's some pressure here now that we're spending all this money.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:07:05):**  Look it is always a pressure spending someone else's money, there's no doubt. But look,  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:07:10):**  no, I'd had a fair bit of experience in that. I had taken on sort of underperforming assets  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:07:16):**  quite a bit in the past. That was probably, as far as the things that I liked that made  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:07:20):**  me tick as sort of the change management thing. So I've always sort of sought out those challenges.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:07:26):**  So I had done a fair bit of kind of capex improvement on other properties I'd run. So

**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:07:35):**  time sort of the rate of expenditure. And it's incredible to know that we've, I think  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:07:40):**  on average, we've only spent about $90 a hectare in all the improvements in fencing and water.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:07:46):**  So it's not hard to work out that we're getting a considerable payback from that investment  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:07:51):**  when you see sort of like our increases in dry matter yield now because of our ability  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:07:56):**  to graze the country better and utilise pastures better.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:00):**  You mentioned the team. Tell us about the team and like one of the, I guess, hard things  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:05):**  is getting everyone on board to make some of those changes. Tell us a little bit about  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:10):**  that.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:11):**  Yeah, that's been the biggest part of the journey in the last five years has just been  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:16):**  the human element. So, and the human change and, you know, mindset. So we've got a fairly  
**[0:08:22-0:08:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:22):**  big team here, kind of 10 or 12 people in various roles from sort of operational managers,  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:29):**  lab manager, you know, down to overseas, station hands. And a lot of them are very experienced  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:34):**  people that have had a lot of time in the industry. They're very good stockmen. But  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:40):**  when you sort of said to them, okay, now what we want you to do is pick up a computer and  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:44):**  start generating some data for us that we can use to make better decisions, you know,  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:49):**  that really didn't come naturally to them initially. So one was sort of about getting  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:54):**  the philosophy right around some of the principles of grazing. The other thing was, you know,  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:08:59):**  giving them the tools and then giving them the training to use those tools to kind of  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:09:04):**  get the outcomes we wanted. And the fabulous part is that I can sit back now after five  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:09:09):**  years and say we've been actually relatively successful at that. I'm amazed at the team's  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:09:14):**  ability to come on the journey with us. It started out, we probably put them all through  
**[0:09:20-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:09:20):**  a lot of training initially. So we sent them off to, you know, Grazing for Profit. They've  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:09:27):**  done other grazing modules. Some of them have done natural sequence farming courses. They've  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:09:32):**  done low stress stock handling courses. You name it, we've given them the opportunity  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:09:38):**  to do that. And I think that's helped a lot.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:09:43):**  Tell me about the kind of use of more data and digital. Like I'm imagining for some of  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:09:47):**  these stockmen going out and saying like, all right, we're going to enter all this information  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:09:50):**  and you're going to use all this tech. Like there was maybe a bit of pushback. How did  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:09:54):**  that, like, do you have any stories about that?  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:09:57):**  Yeah, yeah. Initially there was, you know, guys that they couldn't send a text message  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:02):**  on their phone. And we were saying here, we're downloading this program called My Grazing  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:07):**  onto your phone. And every time you move stock or every time you check the rain gauge, you're  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:11):**  going to have to put something in here. You can imagine what some of these guys thought.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:16):**  They were like, oh my God, you know, you're a lot of going crazy. You know, you know,  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:21):**  you used to get comments like, you know, you can't use a computer to breed sheep, you know,  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:25):**  all those sorts of things. But look, no, people embraced it pretty well. I mean, you know,  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:30):**  people are particularly the team we've got, they all want to improve all the time. And  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:36):**  they want to help the business and they can see the benefits. So they're willing to learn.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:40):**  I mean, some of them, we've had to start with really, really basic computing type assistance.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:47):**  We purchased a lot, you know, a few iPads and that sort of thing, which people could  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:49):**  carry in their ute because some of them, their fingers were too big to operate. The mobile  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:55):**  phone was too small, you know, so they were much more comfortable with an iPad that they  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:10:59):**  could carry in the ute and they could get in there and do the moves on it. But no, everyone's  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:04):**  got to come to terms with it.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:06):**  Other than training, which I want to come back to you and the kind of return on investment  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:10):**  of that, because you could say, oh, that's expensive or maybe not everyone has access  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:13):**  to that. Is there anything else that you did to get people on board or kind of help people  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:18):**  go through that change in mindset?  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:22):**  I think it's just chipping away at it week by week, day by day. Just, you know, it's  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:26):**  just about having a really consistent message. And I was helped, you know, I recruited a  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:32):**  guy as my sort of two IC Tom Deary, who has really helped in the journey with that too.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:38):**  He's got a sort of quiet disposition, but he's doggedly determined. So he was very good  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:43):**  in assisting me delivering that consistent message to staff. So, you know, every time  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:47):**  there was a conversation about, you know, why are we doing this? Or, you know, what's  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:51):**  the point of it? Or this is just extra work, you know, he and I were able to, you know,  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:11:57):**  always answer those sort of queries and concerns and just keep chipping away and heading in  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:02):**  the right direction.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:03):**  Yeah. How much did you use kind of metrics as well to show the improvement? Like I imagine  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:09):**  over a bit of time, you could start to get buy-in because things were working or you  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:13):**  could see the benefits. Did you guys use data with the team or was that more kind of reporting  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:18):**  up in management and to owners?  
**[0:12:21-0:12:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:21):**  No, no, we used the data internally as well. So particularly that say, I can think of a  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:28):**  few examples. One classic example is the forecasting tool in my grazing. So to be able to kind  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:34):**  of just go, you know, if the team are coming to you with concerns going, look, we really  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:38):**  think we're, you know, we're doing our feed budgeting. We think we're running out of feed.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:43):**  We can pull up that forecasting tool and we could run a scenario and say, okay guys, what  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:48):**  if we get only 25% of our average rainfall for the next 6 months? What are we going to  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:53):**  look like then with this number of stock? Or, you know, we are selling those sheep and  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:12:57):**  those cattle. If we put in those sales and we have a reduced rainfall, what's the outcome?  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:02):**  What does that look like? There's a lot of debate originally and you know, still is today  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:06):**  about accuracy of feed budgeting, you know, with having so many different members of the  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:10):**  team. We've got 8 or 9 guys going out and doing feed budgeting every month and obviously  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:14):**  they all look through a slightly different set of eyes. So having the data all the time  
**[0:13:19-0:13:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:19):**  so that they can use that as a reference to sort of calibrate their feed budgeting skills.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:26):**  We have team meetings where we catch up definitely annually and quite often a few times throughout  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:32):**  the year where we just, we do pull a bit of data and sort of present it to them because  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:36):**  it means that they can see what it's all about, you know, that it's been worthwhile. They  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:41):**  can see that the energy of putting that, you know, rubbish in is rubbish out if you like.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:45):**  The quality of the data going in is important for the quality of data that's coming out  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:50):**  to enable them to make better decisions.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:53):**  Matt and his team also use the latest technology to run their Merino stud, including genomics  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:13:58):**  and DNA parent testing. And if you're not across genomics, don't worry, you're about  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:14:03):**  to hear a really good explanation.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:14:05):**  Okay, so genomics is basically gene markers that can be, you know, assessed through DNA  
**[0:14:13-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:14:13):**  and then compared against an extensive reference flock. So you can sort of take a group of

**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:14:26):**  tissue sample, have it sent away for analysis and those 100 sheep can be ranked for particular  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:14:32):**  traits from one to 100. So it might be, you know, wool cut or micron simply off the genetic  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:14:38):**  markers compared against that reference flock, they can rank those animals as being, you

**[0:14:48-0:14:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:14:48):**  So that backs up and it actually adds accuracy to breeding values, you know, that are being  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:14:55):**  generated. So the accuracy of breeding values has improved dramatically as we've got full  
**[0:14:59-0:15:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:14:59):**  pedigree through DNA parentage and also backed up against the reference flock sort of utilising  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:15:06):**  genomics. So, yeah, look, that's sort of the pointy end of the genetics in the business.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:15:12):**  And obviously as a stud where, you know, we're supplying clients with genetics, so it's very  
**[0:15:18-0:15:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:15:18):**  important that we, you know, maximising our rate of genetic gain all the time.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:15:25):**  One of the goals you guys set out from the case study around improving land mortality  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:15:29):**  and around ceasing mulesing, tell me about why you set those goals, when you set them  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:15:35):**  and what the reaction was like from the team.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:15:37):**  Yeah, so that has been an interesting journey too. So we sort of sat down five years ago,  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:15:45):**  it was actually probably longer, and we sort of said that we thought that the consumer  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:15:51):**  was very interested or getting more and more interested in the sort of the ethics behind  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:15:57):**  the way products are produced. That was definitely happening with food and we felt that it was  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:16:02):**  going to happen with fibre as well. So as wool producers, we wanted to be as proactive  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:16:07):**  as we could be around opening up as many markets as possible and, you know, hopefully having  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:16:12):**  a pretty good story to tell and through that story, you know, hopefully being able to attract  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:16:17):**  a bit of a premium in the marketplace because, you know, we knew we had a pretty good product.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:16:22):**  So one of the things that we felt was holding us back was mulesing. Definitely from an animal  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:16:26):**  welfare point of view, it was, I mean, I'm not here to judge, you know, to debate the  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:16:31):**  pros and cons. I'm just saying that from our perspective as a business, we felt that there  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:16:36):**  was a lot of consumers out there saying that they would prefer to buy non-mules wool. So  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:16:42):**  we thought, well, how can we position our business to have the highest animal welfare  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:16:46):**  credentials as possible? So it was kind of my decision from a board level that that was  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:16:53):**  the path we wanted to go down. And then it was about bringing the team on board with,  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:16:57):**  you know, the guys that were out there actually having to manage the sheep. A lot of them  
**[0:17:00-0:17:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:00):**  were quite traditional in their mindset around animal health and they were very, very concerned  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:07):**  about the concept of ceasing mulesing because of obviously worried about fly strike.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:13):**  I think it's probably fair to say all sheep farmers feel fly strike on some level and  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:17):**  many can probably recall at least one horror season. That's why Matt initially had a hard  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:22):**  time convincing his team that not mulesing was a good idea.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:26):**  Yeah, well, it was tough. It was stressful. I kind of said, look, this decision's been  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:31):**  made at the top and now we've got to work out how to make it happen. And a couple of  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:35):**  them said, well, if we get to the point where we've got sheep everywhere that aren't mules,  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:39):**  well, I'm going to go and work somewhere else. That was the sort of level of pushback we  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:43):**  had initially. And there's no point sort of directly arguing with that. So what we did  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:47):**  is we just went away and collected data and gave all sorts of examples of people that  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:52):**  had already done this. We worked out the sort of data that we had to collect to achieve  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:17:58):**  our goal and that was really around breach wrinkle data and bear area data. So we started  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:18:03):**  collecting all that and I kind of explained to the staff that this was going to take time.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:18:08):**  It wasn't like we were going to go cold turkey and cease tomorrow. I think we set a goal  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:18:12):**  of about sort of four to five years and we actually ended up achieving that goal within  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:18:17):**  three years. So we were ahead of schedule. The staff have taken it on board pretty well.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:18:23):**  So far so good. It's been working okay. I think there is still some concern in the team  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:18:29):**  that with a very wet spring this year, we might run into a few more problems than we  
**[0:18:34-0:18:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:18:34):**  have in the last couple of years. But I think it's really about management. I always say  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:18:41):**  to clients that ask me about managing unmilled sheep, I say, well, you can't manage them  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:18:46):**  the same as milled sheep. You have to have a different mindset. So you've just got to  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:18:49):**  be more proactive with applications and sometimes they need an extra crutch, but just got to  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:18:55):**  be on the ball. When they need a drench, they get a drench. You can't be sort of too slack  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:19:00):**  with your timings. But we are attracting market premiums now, which is well and truly compensating  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:19:06):**  us for that extra cost in production through that extra bit of management.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:19:10):**  Yeah, great. Some of the things you mentioned, Matt, seem maybe from the outside like they're  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:19:15):**  expensive and you guys have been fortunate to have resources at your disposal, but do  
**[0:19:19-0:19:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:19:19):**  you feel like, what's your pushback when people say, oh, you've had the resources to do this  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:19:26):**  that maybe other people don't? Has it been profitable? Would you kind of justify the  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:19:31):**  expense and say that there's been a good return?  
**[0:19:34-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:19:34):**  Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Yeah. Look, I mean, there is that opinion in some of the  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:19:41):**  community that sort of say, well, because of the nature of your operation or who the  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:19:46):**  owners are, you don't have to try as hard as other farmers, but that's actually just  
**[0:19:50-0:19:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:19:50):**  not true. We get no external support in this business. Everything that we do here, we generate  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:19:57):**  internally. If we want to build a new shearing shed or buy a new tractor, well, we generate  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:20:02):**  the income to do that. So everything we do is just like a normal farm. Everything we  
**[0:20:07-0:20:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:20:07):**  do, we have to account for the return on investment. So the mules thing really didn't cost a lot  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:20:15):**  of money. It was just about being smart and it was about taking time. It can be done in  
**[0:20:19-0:20:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:20:19):**  any business. I know that people are at different points in the curve as far as some sheep are  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:20:26):**  genetically more suitable than other sheep. And we're in the fortunate position that Malcolm  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:20:32):**  Peake, the stud manager, had been working on breeding planar and planar sheep for many  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:20:35):**  years. So we were in a fairly good starting point when we made the decision to head down  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:20:41):**  the non-mules path. But it's just about collecting data and then using the data to make decisions.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:20:47):**  So by collecting all that breech wrinkle data and body wrinkle data and bare area data,  
**[0:20:52-0:20:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:20:52):**  we were able to build that into a custom index. So when we were selecting animals to use in  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:20:59):**  the stud, you know, stud size, we were finding those animals that were suitable to be non-mules  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:21:04):**  that had, you know, low wrinkle scores, but were also hitting all their other production  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:21:09):**  KPIs. So we felt we were doing it, we were making the change over time without losing  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:21:15):**  production. And that's been very important. It's been a very important message to clients  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:21:19):**  especially.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:21:20):**  It's not just about listening to the data at Cavin Station. It's also about listening  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:21:25):**  to the staff.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:21:26):**  Yeah. So we had some outside help with that to put that, we basically have a staff sort  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:21:33):**  of engagement survey that we have put together, which the staff filled out anonymously. And  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:21:38):**  it had a range of questions and a range of sort of metrics it was trying to measure just

**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:21:49):**  like they were supported in the things they were doing? Did they feel like they had opportunities  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:21:55):**  to improve? Did they feel like they had everything they needed to do their job? Did they feel  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:22:01):**  like they were being listened to? You know, a whole range of sort of questions like that.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:22:05):**  And yeah, no, I was very happy to, you know, in the most recent one, very happy to see  
**[0:22:11-0:22:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:22:11):**  that we kind of, I think our score was about 4.3 out of five or something like that, which  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:22:14):**  was great. We've also had very, very little staff turnover here. Basically had no one  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:22:20):**  turnover in the last four or five years, which has been great.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:22:24):**  Even with all those changes, why do you think that is?  
**[0:22:28-0:22:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:22:28):**  That's a very good question, Sarah. I think maybe not such a bad place to work. Maybe  
**[0:22:37-0:22:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:22:37):**  I'm not such a bad boss after all.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:22:40):**  Is there anything that you would do differently looking back on all these changes?  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:22:44):**  No, I think, I mean, I think what we've done and the way we've done it has been good. I  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:22:50):**  think, you know, sometimes you feel through the process that you're not getting there  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:22:55):**  quick enough, but when you kind of get to where we've got now, you look back, you then  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:00):**  think, well, things take as long as they take. We're obviously, there's still plenty to do.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:06):**  There's still plenty of improvement to be made from here on. It's not like we've got  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:09):**  all the answers. It's definitely a journey of constant, you know, constant improvement.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:15):**  And we feel like it's still fairly early days, but you know, we are kicking some goals and  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:18):**  we can sense that from the data.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:21):**  No, no mistakes or kind of oops, you know, that was a mess along the way, like things  
**[0:23:27-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:27):**  like that, that are good lessons you learned?  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:30):**  I mean, we've obviously had to manage a couple of really horrid drought years in the middle  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:35):**  of all this. And there has been some moments throughout that where we probably could have  
**[0:23:41-0:23:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:41):**  managed things better. You know, I think it was a vastly improved management style we  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:48):**  took into this drought than what was taken into the last drought. However, I think we  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:52):**  could have still been maybe slightly more timely in some of our decisions. I think we  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:23:56):**  were kind of, we were learning on the run a little bit. I think, you know, it would  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:00):**  have been better if this horrible drought had come along, you know, if we had a couple  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:05):**  more years of sort of getting ready, we might've managed it even better. So we'll probably  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:09):**  be in a better position for the next one.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:12):**  Look, you know, the other thing we've used through the drought is containment feeding  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:16):**  areas. And that was another thing that we really had to analyse heavily to see whether  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:21):**  it fitted into our kind of animal welfare ethics. A lot of the staff had some real concerns  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:27):**  about that. They felt that, you know, maybe that wasn't going to fit into what we were  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:31):**  trying to do as far as animal welfare. So we did, there again, we went off and did some  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:35):**  training and utilised, you know, we went and visited people that were doing it, saw it  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:40):**  in action, had consultants from DPI come in and talk to us about how to do it. And we  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:47):**  basically decided that if we had to, if we're going to do it, we had to do it a hundred  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:50):**  percent correctly. And we did, and it was a great success. So we were kind of building  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:24:56):**  that infrastructure as the drought was upon us, you know, so next time we'll be better  
**[0:25:01-0:25:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:01):**  prepared again.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:03):**  Sure. And tell me about what's next when you look at the next five years, do you have some  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:06):**  specific goals that you've set or where do you want to be?  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:10):**  Yeah, look, I think, you know, from an ecological point of view, it's still a lot of monitoring.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:16):**  There's obviously a lot of tree planting. We've got a lot of interest in more natural  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:21):**  sequence farming projects, but from a sort of, from a grazing management point of view,  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:26):**  we feel like we've made really good inroads, but we still not at the point where we're  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:31):**  able to get enough density in our graze at times. So that can only be improved by either  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:38):**  bigger mobs or smaller paddocks. So we've kind of committed to still reducing the average  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:44):**  size of our paddocks down by, you know, another 15 to 20% over the next five years, which  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:49):**  will obviously involve more reticulated water as well. So things are going really well,  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:54):**  but we would like to see our graze periods just a little bit shorter and our rest periods  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:25:58):**  just a little bit longer and that density, because we feel we're going to make just greater  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:26:05):**  landscape change by getting that density a bit better. So those are the sort of things  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:26:12):**  we're working towards. They're not massive changes from what we're doing, but we're just  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:26:17):**  going to be doing it all better. We are moving towards, you know, we think we're probably  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:26:22):**  carbon neutral already, but we want to make sure we are. So we're going to get impact  
**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:26:26):**  tagged to do a survey into where we're at in that neck of the woods. And we also looking  
**[0:26:32-0:26:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:26:32):**  towards possibly, because we are sequestering carbon in our business, we want to hopefully,  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:26:39):**  if market conditions are right, maybe attract another stream of income from carbon sometime  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:26:45):**  over the next five years as well. Some of these things are, I would say, maybe  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:26:50):**  controversial or things that get pushed back, you know, regenerative, carbon neutral, non-mules.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:26:56):**  Do you, like, I don't know, what are the conversations like at the pub or with your neighbours? I  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:00):**  know I posted a picture of when I was out at Kevin and there was a good amount of thistle  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:04):**  in that picture and I had a few people asking me about, you know, weeds and what was happening.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:08):**  How do you kind of deal with personally that that may be pushed back?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:13):**  Yeah, look, it's always there. It's always there. We are, you know, we do do things differently  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:18):**  to a lot of the neighbours, some of the neighbours. And there is a community perception because  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:23):**  we're a fairly big operation, you know, there is a bit of talk in the community around what's  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:28):**  going on out at Kevin. I think the weeds thing is an interesting one. I think, you know,  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:32):**  people driving past Kevin at the moment, you know, probably going, oh, look at all those  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:37):**  weeds. But, you know, for the last two years when the district's been in drought, they've  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:41):**  probably been driving past Kevin going, wow, look how good Kevin looks because look at  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:45):**  all that ground cover, you know, and they've got grass and no one else has. So, you know,  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:49):**  look, it's all swings and roundabouts. So don't let it worry me too much. You know,  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:54):**  we're on the journey we're on and we've got very good reasons why. And I'm happy to discuss  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:27:58):**  any of those sort of reasons with anyone that wants to listen. You know, like the weed thing,  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:28:04):**  we sort of feel that covered up ground is better than bare ground. We think that that'll  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:28:10):**  come back into balance as we get our grazing management right. We feel that, you know,  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:28:13):**  nature puts plants in places for a reason. There's a reason why, you know, sometimes  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:28:18):**  as thistle's growing, they're a great coloniser and, you know, they're building organic carbon  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:28:23):**  and, you know, the next phase will be a grass phase that comes through, you know. Let's  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:28:27):**  just say we've got a lot of clover around and, you know, all that clover is fixing nitrogen  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:28:31):**  and, you know, from the nitrogen grass will grow. So it's all cyclical. Yeah, so, you  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:28:36):**  know, the perceptions of, you know, outsiders into our business, you know, it is something

**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:28:47):**  business the way you think it needs to be run. Yeah, but a thick skin as well maybe?  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:28:52):**  Yeah, a little bit, yeah. Matt, what's the biggest thing you've personally  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:28:57):**  learned maybe about yourself or yourself as a leader or manager?  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:29:03):**  Yeah, I think, you know, I think the people management, the leadership just simply through

**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:29:14):**  message you're delivering you have to believe in and then just communication, you know,  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:29:19):**  whenever anyone's got a concern you've just got to take the time to talk that concern  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:29:23):**  through and hopefully, you know, you can back your argument up with a bit of data. That  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:29:26):**  always helps. Human beings like to see a bit of evidence. I mean, I think one other thing  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:29:32):**  I'd like to just mention around, you know, outside views of the business is that one  
**[0:29:37-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:29:37):**  of the things we're going to do is we're going to benchmark, you know, we're going to financially  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:29:40):**  benchmark. We have in the past and we've had a bit of a break but we're about to commence  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:29:45):**  that again because I want to be able to show people that, you know, we can be very competitive  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:29:50):**  financially. The financial performance of this business would be very competitive with  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/4/matt-crozier-changing-human-behavior#t=0:29:54):**  any farming business yet at the same time we're delivering these ecological kind of

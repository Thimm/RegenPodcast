### Agtech - So What?  (2019-12-04)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:22-0:00:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:00:22):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. Today's episode is something a little bit  
**[0:00:42-0:00:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:00:42):**  different. It's a live interview I did with two Australian farmers, Ash and David, who've  decided to start off farm businesses using technology. That's right, they're ag tech  startup founders, in addition to being producers. Ash and David are part of the Farmers to Founders  
**[0:00:58-0:01:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:00:58):**  Bootcamp, a three month program designed for producers to help them grow their businesses.  There are eight teams participating in the bootcamp program right now. Some have businesses  in ag tech like Ash and David, while others are value adding to their produce, creating  
**[0:01:13-0:01:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:01:13):**  food and cosmetic products. The Farmers to Founders Bootcamp is a super intense four  day in person program. When we caught up with Ash and David, they were just starting day  four. Before we jump into my chat with Ash, I'll just apologize about the audio quality  
**[0:01:27-0:01:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:01:27):**  for my voice. The guests sound great, but I only had one mic with me, so we had to improvise  a bit on my end and it didn't work out that great. That said, we still think the interviews  are awesome and wanted to get them to you. So sorry about my audio and here's Ash.  
**[0:01:44-0:02:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:01:44):**  I'm from Dubbo in Central West New South Wales and I'm from a mixed farm that I run with  my husband. So cropping mainly and then sheep as well. So coming to Farmers to Founders  to pursue an idea on an ag tech startup, which I guess is a bit more of an idea at the moment,  
**[0:02:02-0:02:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:02:02):**  but extremely exciting. So tell me a bit more about the farm. How long have you guys been  farming there? So we have just been at Trangie, sorry, west of Dubbo. I think we're still  new in country terms. I'm originally from Kinamble and grew up there and my family has  
**[0:02:19-0:02:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:02:19):**  been there for as long as I can remember. Farming there as well.  Farming there as well. I remember one time I was in Wagga Wagga and I caught a cab and  the woman was like, I asked her where she was from, the cabbie, and she's like, or I  
**[0:02:32-0:02:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:02:32):**  said, are you from Wagga? She's like, no, no, I've only been here 32 years. Like, right.  I clearly have come from a different context. I think you're still new at 32 years too.  So I'm not sure when I'll become part of the furniture in Trangie, but I'm working on it  
**[0:02:45-0:02:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:02:45):**  and it's lovely town. So hopefully that will be soon.  Tell me about how you got started with the training paddock. Like, was there a moment  where you said we had to build a tech business? I don't know if it was that light bulb moment.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:02:58):**  It was more my family and I were persuaded to go to a seminar by our then bank manager  and really didn't want to go. We didn't want to go. Anyway, he said, oh, look, come, please  come. I need some people. So we went and we had this challenge to find or isolate something  
**[0:03:15-0:03:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:03:15):**  that was really hard for people in rural Australia, especially in farming and agribusinesses.  And then from there I took a video, three minute feature video, which is something I  don't usually do, just on my phone randomly and sent it to the New South Wales DPI. And  
**[0:03:32-0:03:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:03:32):**  here we are 18 months later going through a couple of different programs and testing  the idea and in the process of making the tech platform. And yeah.  I asked Ash exactly what she took a video of. Was it her or was it people experiencing  
**[0:03:48-0:04:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:03:48):**  the problem she wanted to solve? I took a video of myself just rambling in  my sort of dry paddock with a bit of wind and there's some sheep in the background and  looked very bland. And I wanted to explain how we could empower people and highlight  
**[0:04:06-0:04:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:04:06):**  that the skills in agriculture and other careers are just as important and valued as every  other career, such as an academic career. Yeah, right. And you are a teacher, right?  Teacher, yes. One of the things that you said earlier that  
**[0:04:20-0:04:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:04:20):**  I love was I learned as a teacher to never show weakness, which was funny in context  of having some investors come into the eyewitnesses. Yes. Can't show weakness in front of anyone,  but behind closed doors it's a bit of a different story. But I think it's one thing that I learned  
**[0:04:34-0:04:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:04:34):**  early on that you need to be resilient in getting what you think is the best thing and  pushing forward with ideas and passions and dreams.  Totally. It's so interesting. The reason I was excited about Farmers to Founders and  
**[0:04:48-0:05:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:04:48):**  getting involved was seeing so many parallels between farmers and entrepreneurs, that there  are people running businesses, there are people managing risk, there are people just taking  on a lot, doing big and ambitious and impressive things. And so having farmers that are founders  
**[0:05:03-0:05:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:05:03):**  is so awesome. And obviously working with people like you, have you found similarities  in farming and being a founder? I think you said risk. And yes, there's always  an element of risk that you have to manage. A lot of us who are in farming or run farm  
**[0:05:20-0:05:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:05:20):**  businesses I guess don't see them as businesses, which I think leads us to be people who get  up every morning with a fierce passion and fire to make things happen that day. And we  just get on with it and do it. And I think that that's something you need to be an entrepreneur  
**[0:05:38-0:05:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:05:38):**  as well because sometimes it is really, really hard. But I think every time that it gets  hard you end up going back and walking away for a minute and then coming back and there's  always that same passion and drive to get something done. So yeah, similar.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:05:53):**  One of the things I loved was yesterday we were talking a little bit about some of your  potential customers and just how painful the problem is that they have. And it was cool  to see the kind of light come on in your eyes about just solving that problem, like clearly  
**[0:06:06-0:06:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:06:06):**  passionate about taking away that pain. Do you want to talk a little bit about the problem  that you solved with Training Fatik? Well, yeah, I like solving problems. I think  that comes from being in a farming background. I think someone said that once we were the  
**[0:06:20-0:06:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:06:20):**  original entrepreneurs in the world as farmers. So maybe I'm carrying that torch through into  technology. I think Training Fatik had a real desire to bring technology to create more  transparent records and trustful skilled-based profiles of the people that were in skilled-based  
**[0:06:42-0:07:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:06:42):**  careers. We had a couple of approaches. One business comes to mind about them manually  hiring someone to go through Excel sheets of skills and training and certifications  of 300 employees. And if anyone can imagine themselves sitting in front of a spreadsheet  
**[0:07:00-0:07:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:07:00):**  with columns of dates and ticks and yeses and nos and having someone go through that,  it's pretty painful. So that's what we're trying to solve. We're trying to make it quick  and easy. It took me a while to get my head around this,  
**[0:07:12-0:07:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:07:12):**  but basically Ash explained that many businesses need to actually prove that they have certain  records and certifications for their employees to be able to even do certain jobs. So for  example, a mining company might need records of training or qualifications before staff  
**[0:07:27-0:07:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:07:27):**  can even get onto a job site. And right now those records are managed manually through  spreadsheets. So it's really inefficient and there's a huge issue with these certificates  getting lost. But it's not just other businesses that Ash has met that have this problem. Ash's  
**[0:07:44-0:07:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:07:44):**  family has actually experienced this challenge firsthand.  Yeah, my husband got turned away the other day. So we were eligible to work with the  LLS to get some baiting to overcome feral pigs that were eating all of the drought fodder  
**[0:07:58-0:08:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:07:58):**  at the moment out there. And he drove all the way into town ready to pick it up and  he couldn't find his ChemCert certificate. And he was sure that he had it and I know  that he has it, but he ended up having to turn around and leave the chemical there because  
**[0:08:11-0:08:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:08:11):**  he didn't have that certificate. So they're the sorts of problems we're trying to overcome.  Something that's quick and easy on your phone or your tablet at home in your computer that  you can use whenever you need them.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:08:23):**  So where is Training Paddock up to and how can you learn more if you're keen to follow  Ash's journey?  So we are ready to put some trials on in February, which is really exciting. And in the meantime,  
**[0:08:35-0:08:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:08:35):**  we've got our website up where you can put in your inquiry details and keep following  us on Facebook, social media, and LinkedIn, which is great. www.trainingpaddock.com.au.  Awesome. Cool. Thanks.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:08:55):**  My second chat was with David Ricardo, founder of Farm Service Manager. David, like Ash and  all of the other producers we work with at Farmers to Founders, is solving a problem  that he himself has experienced. But before we get to that, we'll hear a bit more about  
**[0:09:09-0:09:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:09:09):**  David, his background and his farm.  I'm a farmer at Walgett in northern New South Wales, going through a terrible drought right  now. But one good positive thing that's coming out of it is a new app that I'm developing.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:09:21):**  So before we get into Farm Service Manager, I want to hear a little bit more about the  farm. So what do you farm out there?  Well, in a normal season, we grow wheat and barley, chickpeas, canola, sometimes, fava  
**[0:09:34-0:09:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:09:34):**  beans. And we've started growing dryland cotton in the last few seasons.  And how long have you been on the farm?  Well, since I was a boy. Thirty odd years in the Walgett district.  
**[0:09:45-0:10:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:09:45):**  David has seen things change quite a bit over the last 30 years.  A lot of our farming practices have changed a lot. Zero till and crop rotation. Yeah,  we're doing all sorts of things from our conventional to its methods from 25, 30 years ago.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:10:02):**  You're pretty into technology, it sounds like. I mean, not everyone builds an app. Are you  into technology on the farm as well?  Not only, yeah. GPS steering and all of that's just sort of a pretty common thing these days.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:10:15):**  Camera sprays. Yeah, we're looking forward to going fully automated in the next few years,  I guess, when it's commercially available with our tractors. We've got the economies  of scale out there on some broad acres, long runs, just a perfect fit for automated tractors  
**[0:10:32-0:10:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:10:32):**  one day.  So tell me about the story behind Farm Service Manager. How did you go from just farming  and thinking about farming to I'm going to build an app and a text business?  
**[0:10:42-0:10:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:10:42):**  Basically we've got a lot of machinery on farm and I rely a lot on service records to  keep that machinery in good order. And of course, I had a problem a couple of years  ago in losing the service logbook out of the workshop. That had all our records in it.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:10:59):**  So that was a big loss.  When you say logbook, I'm thinking like a notebook that fits in your pocket and you're  writing down like when you change the oil, when you change the filters. Is that what  
**[0:11:09-0:11:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:11:09):**  you mean?  Our service logbook was, we had pages on every machine, a huge amount of detail in terms  of the work done and who did the work, spare parts, even tire sizes, lots of detail, a  
**[0:11:24-0:11:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:11:24):**  wealth of information on every machine we ran.  So it must have been like horrible when you lost it. What did that feel like?  Well, we spent a bit of time looking for it and of course it turned up six months later  
**[0:11:36-0:11:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:11:36):**  behind the seat of someone's ute. But at that point, many records were lost. And so, look,  I made the decision then there's got to be a better way in the old line. Good old farmer  ingenuity to fix a problem. I wanted to ensure we didn't lose the logbook again. I built  
**[0:11:55-0:12:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:11:55):**  a digital logbook.  So how did you go on the journey of figuring out how to actually build software?  Well, it was a long journey. I thought I could do it on the cheap with a programmer and soon  
**[0:12:08-0:12:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:12:08):**  found that not everybody knows everything about Android and iOS and web-based applications.  So I set about, well, after spending some time going down one path, I dropped the idea  thinking it was just too hard. Came back to it six months later thinking there's nothing  
**[0:12:28-0:12:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:12:28):**  in the space that fits the kind of application I needed.  So you had actually had a bit of a look around at, you know, was there something off the  shelf you could buy and you couldn't find anything?  
**[0:12:38-0:12:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:12:38):**  Nothing for the situation. We've got a couple of farms, 20 k's apart. I needed an application  that was accessible by all my team and something that was mobile. So an app ticked all the  boxes at the time.  
**[0:12:52-0:13:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:12:52):**  And the equipment companies and stuff would have their own kind of apps and things to  help with service, but I imagine they don't have anything that goes across different brands  that you could use kind of for anything. Is that true?  
**[0:13:02-0:13:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:13:02):**  Yeah. Most manufacturers are working on apps these days that are based on telemetry systems.  Farm Service Manager can set notifications to the next service without the use of telemetry.  So at a time when everything's heading that way, yeah, we're sort of steering away from  
**[0:13:20-0:13:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:13:20):**  telemetry. Of course, there's a high cost associated with that. And I guess the big  thing is that there's no way you'd put telemetry on a cultivator or a slasher or a small pump  or compressor. So there's a cost problem there.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:13:35):**  I was joking with you and your wife. Sue is here as well. I'd like to speak about my dad  on our very much hobby farm, but Sue's got all kinds of equipment and I guarantee he's  got no kind of record for anything because he's the one that goes to the auction and  
**[0:13:49-0:14:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:13:49):**  thinks he can get something so cheap. But I guarantee it doesn't come with a record.  He probably gets screwed over every time. That's a big problem generally. Resale value  is maximized when you've got a service history. It's another bargaining chip and yeah, you'll  
**[0:14:03-0:14:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:14:03):**  have to tell your father about the app. So he's over in the US. Do you have customers  for the app just in Australia or can you use it elsewhere?  I've got customers almost on every continent now. We've got the majority in Australia,  
**[0:14:17-0:14:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:14:17):**  of course, but North America is coming on board. Quite a lot in the US and Canada and  Europe and even South America now. And what's it been like building the app and  building this business? Have you found that it's easier than being a farmer, harder than  
**[0:14:31-0:14:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:14:31):**  being a farmer? Any kind of parallels between the two?  Well, it's been difficult. The learning curve on some of this technology and even the jargon,  the tech speak, it's been hard to get my head around at times.  
**[0:14:46-0:15:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:14:46):**  It's a funny one. Sue was the one that said earlier this week to myself when I was explaining  one of the exercises we were doing. She's like, you got to slow down and stop talking  so fast. It's like you're speaking a whole other language, which I'm sure it feels like.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:15:00):**  And to be fair, if I'm with a bunch of farmers and they're getting pretty deep into agronomy  or something like that, it can equally feel like another language for people coming from  the tech side. So yeah, it's definitely a bit of a challenge.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:15:12):**  Do you find that the challenges in thinking about growing Farm Service Manager as a business  are exciting, are scary? Well, it's an exciting time for sure. There  are so many opportunities out there. And this boot camp with Farm and the founder over the  
**[0:15:27-0:15:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:15:27):**  last four days has just opened up so many new windows I never knew existed. So I'm looking  forward to the next three months of marketing changes and things that we're doing to excel  in the business. What's maybe one thing that you learned this  
**[0:15:45-0:15:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:15:45):**  week or one thing you're excited to put into practice over the coming months?  Well, I like the idea of content, blog posts and so on.  You mean like podcasts of course. Yeah, no, I'll have a go at that sometime.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:15:59):**  But so many avenues honestly in testing what works and what doesn't and having a better  understanding about my customers and their users because not everyone is a farmer. There's  a lot of operators out there, employees working for farmers that are actually doing the hard  
**[0:16:17-0:16:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:16:17):**  yards when it comes to service, changing oils and filters and daily inspections and so on.  Where can people find more about Farm Service Manager?  Well, they can try the App Store or Google Play to download the app. There's also our  
**[0:16:32-0:16:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:16:32):**  website farmservicemanager.com gives a pretty good description.  Awesome, David. Well, thanks so much for chatting.  Well, thanks very much, Sarah. It's been a pleasure.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=508037#t=0:16:41):**  That's it for now from two of the producer led teams in the Farmers to Founders boot  camp. But we'll chat with David and Ash again to see how they're going. And we'll also catch  up with some of the other teams in the boot camp in a future episode. In the meantime,

**[0:00:09-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:00:09):**  When we think about the global future of agriculture, especially one characterized by exponentially  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:00:13):**  more climate risk, it's not easy to tell what impact, positive or negative, that insurance,  
**[0:00:19-0:00:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:00:19):**  and specifically crop insurance, might have going forward.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:00:22):**  More risk likely means more demand for and interest in insurance, as farmers and ranchers  
**[0:00:27-0:00:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:00:27):**  look for ways to offload some of that increasing liability.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:00:30):**  But what does that rising risk level mean for the companies that do the insuring?  
**[0:00:35-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:00:35):**  And on top of that, what could technology do for this space?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:00:38):**  These questions led us to have several conversations with folks on the cutting edge of the ag-insure  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:00:42):**  tech space, and we're pumped to share some of the insights in the coming episodes.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:00:47):**  But first, the one thing we realized very early on in this journey is that ag insurance  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:00:51):**  is a complex and mysterious world that, despite how many people use, interact, or pontificate  
**[0:00:56-0:00:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:00:56):**  about it, it's just not very well understood.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:00:59):**  To offer meaningful insights on where the space is going, we knew we needed to start  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:01:03):**  with a primer to bring us all up to speed.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:01:05):**  So I called up farmer, investor, and Canadian friend of the show, Matt Coutts, chief investment  
**[0:01:10-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:01:10):**  officer at Coutts Capital.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:01:12):**  Matt has interacted with the ag insurance space from many angles, including as a farmer,  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:01:16):**  and he graciously agreed to chat through how the sector works.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:01:19):**  A note here, if you are one of the tens of people who already know everything there is  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:01:22):**  to know about ag insurance, you can skip straight through to the next episode, featuring Damon  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:01:26):**  Johnson of parametric.ag for a deeper look at emerging ag-insure tech.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:01:32):**  But if you're like most of us, buckle up for a crash course.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:01:35):**  Our conversation started with the question of how do farmers understand risk?  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:01:39):**  It's certainly ever present because some of the risks that farmers face are uncontrollable.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:01:43):**  Obviously the big one being weather.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:01:46):**  Following that, you've got commodity prices, interest rates, currencies, and then another  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:01:51):**  risk of it you're buying from branded companies and selling things as commodities, oligopolies  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:01:56):**  all around.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:01:57):**  So farmers live in like a crazy risk environment and just try to deal with it day to day, generally  
**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:02:03):**  the best way they can, whether it's keeping costs low, not getting overexposed on the  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:02:06):**  things you can't control, debt and things like that.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:02:09):**  And then maybe like 60, 70% of farmers will generally buy a crop insurance product to  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:02:15):**  protect against severe weather impacts to their crop.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:02:19):**  That generally protects you on the edges.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:02:21):**  And as you've seen, biotech and all these different factors have made the tail events  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:02:25):**  much more relevant over the day to day weather stuff, less so.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:02:28):**  So farmers, yeah, we generally just try to do our best and to control knowing that the  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:02:35):**  uncontrollables will bite us at some point and sometimes several of those uncontrollables  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:02:39):**  at once.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:02:40):**  So if I were a farmer, how would I know that I like need or could benefit from insurance?  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:02:45):**  And then how would I go about actually purchasing it?  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:02:48):**  I mean, I guess if you need like one, every farmer should consider it because every outdoor  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:02:53):**  farmer should consider it.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:02:55):**  I don't know if you have any indoor nor egg investments, but every farmer faces the weather  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:02:59):**  risk and I arguably indoor farmers do with natural gas power as well.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:04):**  So everyone should consider it.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:05):**  And then we simply go to your broker.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:08):**  And generally most insurance in North America anyways is offered and subsidized by the government,  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:13):**  which is kind of a lot of farmers to say, solve them for the last several decades.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:17):**  So you go there, you get a quote, be compared more or less what your guarantee under certain  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:21):**  weather events is compared to your cost structure and your expected revenues.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:25):**  If that makes reasonable sense, you do it.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:27):**  I always can do a lot more back testing in terms of how frequent these weather events  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:31):**  occur, how extreme they are.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:33):**  You can hire a meteorologist, et cetera, and actuaries.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:36):**  Most of the time you just say this seems a reasonable premium for the coverage I'm getting  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:42):**  relative to my at risk capital, which would be your costs.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:47):**  And so when you say broker, is that a specific company that only sells insurance?  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:50):**  Are they tied to other things that you might be buying?  
**[0:03:53-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:53):**  Are they tied to a bank?  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:54):**  Who are these insurers?  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:03:56):**  Generally like I'm in Canada, generally it's just like a government entity that sells it.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:01):**  And I believe the US is bringing a lot more private market players in, but I'm in Saskatchewan,  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:06):**  it's Saskatchewan crop insurance.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:07):**  I don't even know if broker is the right term, but the agent or the broker that we buy it  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:11):**  from and they exclusively just sell crop insurance.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:16):**  I guess livestock insurance, but not a market that we're in.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:21):**  And how do the products work for the insurance company?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:23):**  Like how do they make money?  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:25):**  We don't have extreme weather events is how they would make money, I guess.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:28):**  Which seems unlikely.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:29):**  So that's the question.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:32):**  And it's the extremes.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:34):**  Maybe you claim 10 to 20% of the time.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:36):**  So usually they're pretty good.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:37):**  And then the important thing is the reinsurance to have a backstop.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:42):**  Because if you can have a traditional loss ratio, that would be good.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:47):**  It's say like a 70 to 90% and it means you're making 10 to 30 cents margin.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:53):**  That's fine.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:04:54):**  But if you have a unlimited loss type of policy, then you could have a 600% loss ratio and  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:05:00):**  you go and solve them pretty quickly.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:05:02):**  So those are like the key things I think is what they is.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:05:04):**  Nobody wants to be the turkey.

**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:05:13):**  And just given the mass challenge posed by the weather is government's been forced to

**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:05:22):**  In one way, there's probably less frequency, as I said, with biotech and different equipment  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:05:27):**  and different ways to optimize your crop.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:05:30):**  However, the costs are so much higher now compared to 30, 40 years ago that there's  
**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:05:35):**  a lot more dollars at risk.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:05:37):**  And with the inflation environment, we have specifically the lack of natural gas drilling.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:05:42):**  The cost of fertilizer is only going to continue to go up, probably the same as iron ore and  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:05:47):**  things like that driving equipment prices higher and higher.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:05:50):**  So probably that tail risk in the proportion of that severity is likely going to increase.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:05:57):**  And is it correct that there's two at least major types of insurance around like protecting  
**[0:06:02-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:06:02):**  price or revenue and then protecting product quantity?  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:06:05):**  And I don't know, how do you think about the types of insurance?  
**[0:06:07-0:06:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:06:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:06:08):**  So there's like a yield based on far side, which is strictly just, there's kind of an  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:06:13):**  index price based upon how much yield declined and then times by that prices.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:06:18):**  If you get below a certain trigger often that's a 70 or 80%.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:06:21):**  So if your trigger is 80% and you've grown a yield 60% of based upon that expected number,  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:06:27):**  which is based on a farmer's past, then you'd get a payout between that 60 and 80% times  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:06:32):**  by the index price.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:06:33):**  So they all kind of implicitly get to the same way, but some from specific that are  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:06:37):**  focused on say revenue or gross margin, or they're specifically underwriting your ability  
**[0:06:41-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:06:41):**  to get to those numbers and they're looking closer at your cost structure and things like  
**[0:06:44-0:06:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:06:44):**  that.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:06:45):**  Actually going over your financial statements.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:06:47):**  Both obviously have a lot of issues, whether it be adverse selection or conflict of interest  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:06:55):**  on the information sharing, but they both get to the same way and arguably have the  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:00):**  same information asymmetry just for different reasons.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:05):**  Unpack those challenges for me a little bit.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:06):**  My understanding is that you get into these weird, like me against you dynamics where  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:11):**  however much I want to share is to optimize for my side, as opposed to what really happened.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:16):**  But it's definitely zero sum insurance can every dollar they lose is a dollar a farmer  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:21):**  a farmer's getting it in their hand.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:23):**  So if farmer in a claim scenario in the traditional yield base is they'll just literally drive  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:28):**  the field with the adjuster and they'll look and say, we think this is about this yield  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:31):**  compared to what you're expecting.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:33):**  And, Oh yeah, that sounds right.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:34):**  Or they'll count the bins.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:36):**  That's more for hail, I should say actually.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:38):**  And then you do inventory record keeping up the bins, which is not generally digital or  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:43):**  verifiable.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:44):**  It's just we look and okay.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:46):**  Guess the minute where that is.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:47):**  So it's certainly not perfect.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:50):**  There's new solutions with satellites that make things more binary and transparent or  
**[0:07:54-0:07:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:54):**  just weather indices.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:07:55):**  And then on the financial side, there's less information asymmetry in terms of what's shared  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:00):**  in terms of how decisions are made.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:01):**  It's maybe less, less obvious in terms of a different business strategy.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:05):**  That's maybe not revenue maximizing, but it's a free cashflow maximization and things like  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:11):**  that.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:12):**  So a lot of other things come into account.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:13):**  And then with farmers, of course you have inventory driven revenue, not, not, not, not  
**[0:08:17-0:08:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:17):**  physical sales and stuff.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:18):**  So lots of challenges on the analysis of either side, both on the underwriting and then the  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:23):**  claims and loss process as well.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:26):**  Loss adjustment process as well.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:28):**  You mentioned underwriting.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:29):**  I want to unpack a little bit of the different terms in this space.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:32):**  So you've got like an underwriter, a reinsurer, an insurance agent, a broker, a master general  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:37):**  agent.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:38):**  Can you help to unpack these different titles and how they interact or walk you through  
**[0:08:44-0:08:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:44):**  the value chain?  
**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:46):**  So the underwriter would be the person that provides the price.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:48):**  They assess the risk and give you the price, just like a credit analyst or something like  
**[0:08:52-0:08:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:52):**  that would set your interest rate.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:53):**  The actuary is maybe more analogy I've heard once before it is you're driving in a car  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:08:58):**  and everyone's telling the driver what to do.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:00):**  The underwriters looking out the front window, telling them what to do.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:03):**  Well, the actuary is looking out the rear view there and telling the driver where to  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:07):**  go.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:08):**  But however, the actuaries are probably focused more on kind of your tail terminal risk, full  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:12):**  balance sheet, that type of thing where the underwriters may be more focused on interim  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:16):**  profit on a policy under the normal assumptions and pricing probably.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:20):**  So they both are important in terms of providing a saleable product, but also protecting the  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:24):**  company because it's like any fast growing insurance company is almost destined to go  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:28):**  bankrupt, but just the way it is.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:29):**  And then now that's why it's important to have different people in the industry, such  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:33):**  as the managing general agent, you meant because maybe they don't have the same balance sheet  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:38):**  risks.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:39):**  There may be almost more like a sales force out in front.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:40):**  And then so they can grow quickly, presumably that they're spreading their book, their insurance  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:45):**  paper over to two different insurance and reinsurance companies.

**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:53):**  So tell me about the difference between a reinsurer and an insurer.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:09:56):**  Reinsurer is the insurer's insurer, just to put it simply, but it's confusing with simply.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:01):**  Yeah, it's funny how such a confusing space, right?  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:03):**  These terms are, I find it challenging to think about the depth that this industry goes  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:09):**  and the amount of margin that has to get divided across all of these players to make it work  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:14):**  in the current ways.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:15):**  Yeah, so it is the second oldest industry in the world, I think.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:19):**  And so with that, you've got a lot of incumbent terms and a lot of incumbent layers to the  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:23):**  process that maybe should be there or should not be there, but they've slowly gotten there.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:27):**  For example, the loss ratio term is what the industry uses.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:31):**  It's just the inverse of net income.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:32):**  I don't know why people just don't use net income or unlevered cash.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:35):**  That's more traditional, but we have to use these confusing things that in other issues,  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:39):**  of course, but it makes it a little more difficult to discuss with people.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:42):**  And then you've got challenges and what's your risk and what's your probable risk and  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:46):**  things like that.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:47):**  So assuming this podcast is less than 36 hours, we probably won't get it all covered, which  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:52):**  makes it exciting too, because it's so old.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:54):**  It is everywhere and everywhere has a different take, a different regulatory environment,  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:58):**  different customer base.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:10:59):**  So there's a lot of different issues around the world within an old archaic system, but  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:11:05):**  this is the more, it's very non-insurance companies don't go bankrupt every time there's  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:11:08):**  a blip in the market.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:11:10):**  They have those insurance layers behind those risks, risk management layers behind them.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:11:15):**  Do you think that the like industry could exist without insurance?  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:11:23):**  There's this kind of statement of it's necessary or it's been this way forever.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:11:26):**  What would a world look like without insurance?  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:11:28):**  Agriculture specifically would be, there'd be like probably a couple of billion less  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:11:32):**  people alive.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:11:33):**  I'm sure.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:11:34):**  If not, maybe a half the population we have today, just because we couldn't take the risk  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:11:38):**  to grow this amount of grain, yeah, it would definitely be catastrophic in a sense.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:11:43):**  You mentioned insurance companies when they're high growth, they are at risk of going bankrupt.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:11:47):**  Like how do they think about de-risking their portfolios and how does the economics of an  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:11:53):**  insurance company sort of impact what products eventually get offered to farmers?  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:11:57):**  So generally just like segmenting your risk across different customer bases and things  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:02):**  like that.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:03):**  So only taking so much exposure, maybe in a different geography or different product  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:07):**  class, maybe the total growth is high, but maybe you're getting a bit from San Francisco  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:12):**  property and your earthquake insurance there and some in agriculture, weather risk in the  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:18):**  Midwest and terrorism risk in Toronto or New York and prices like that.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:22):**  So maybe you try to balance it would be the main thing.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:25):**  And then also the layering it over to other reinsurers kind of not a lender of last resort,  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:29):**  but a backstop of last resort.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:32):**  It's interesting the costs to manage the risks seem really interesting to me because there's  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:36):**  like geographical diversity to manage for that weather risk, maybe different kinds of  
**[0:12:41-0:12:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:41):**  products.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:42):**  Then you've also got like spreading the margin differently in the value chain.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:46):**  And you mentioned before, like a lot of this isn't digitally native, so it just sounds  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:49):**  really expensive to do, let alone like claims on the other side.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:53):**  I guess it's crazy to me how there are so many big insurance companies in the world  
**[0:12:57-0:12:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:57):**  that have made so much money.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:12:58):**  And yet when I think about the cost of running a business like this, it's pretty astounding.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:03):**  So whether it's like archaic IT systems that they're not digital, but they still have,  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:08):**  you know, long-term IT systems, lots of people in there everywhere.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:12):**  And then specifically in agriculture, you need to have trucks to get everywhere or fly  
**[0:13:16-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:16):**  and things like that.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:18):**  It's expensive, but maybe that's, they charge enough that it keeps the lights on.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:22):**  Maybe last question for you, Matt, is as growing like uncertainty increases around weather  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:28):**  risk generally, does that pose a kind of existential threat to insurance or changes the economics  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:34):**  and what does that mean for farmers?  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:36):**  Obviously change the economics as the risk goes up, the price set appropriately.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:41):**  But a big part of a specific in agriculture is the government is not the biggest market.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:45):**  The government backs up whether it's the subsidy or not.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:48):**  That'll continue to be there.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:49):**  So maybe it doesn't go as extreme because they'll still be there to make sure farmers  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:53):**  can afford to have insurance with their subsidy or not.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:13:55):**  But certainly directionally, as risk increases, I think we can all expect premiums to increase  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:14:01):**  as well.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:14:03):**  There's a lot to keep track of here, especially given that rather than the requisite 30 plus  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:14:07):**  hour intro to ag insurance that Matt suggested, we've spent less than 30 minutes on it.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:14:11):**  So I want to draw your attention to a few key points.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:14:14):**  First, insurance, specifically insurance against weather risk, works for farmers usually by  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:14:19):**  closing the financial gap between what they actually have to sell at the end of the season  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:14:24):**  what they could have had.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:14:25):**  This is a challenging and expensive proposition.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:14:28):**  It inevitably requires having a lot of complex information, including plenty that can only  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:14:32):**  be collected by insurance agents and adjusters on the ground.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:14:35):**  Next, as Matt so aptly pointed out, insurance companies make money when weather destruction  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:14:41):**  doesn't occur, which almost inevitably means that fast growing insurance companies can  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:14:45):**  quickly end up insolvent due to a single weather event.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:14:48):**  Consider if say car insurance were like ag insurance, insurers would be staring down  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:14:52):**  the risk that virtually every one of their policy holders in a region gets in a car accident  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:14:57):**  on the same day.

**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:15:02):**  And thus we can expect policies to become increasingly expensive as this gets priced  
**[0:15:06-0:15:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:15:06):**  in.

**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:15:11):**  a zero sum game between the insurance company and their farmer customers.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:15:16):**  Every dollar in a farmer's hand, in other words, is a dollar out of the insurance company's  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:15:20):**  bottom line.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:15:21):**  Pair this fact with the reality that ag insurance is currently a space with a lot of players  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:15:25):**  who look an awful lot like middlemen seems to us to be a good sign that technology has  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:15:30):**  the potential to shake ag insurance up in a big way.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:15:33):**  So I asked Matt about how ag insurance is currently using digital tech and what he expects  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:15:38):**  to change in the coming years.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:15:39):**  I'm just going to have two avenues.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:15:41):**  One there's weather centric, which is satellite data and then just general weather industry  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:15:45):**  data that can be like a number of private and government agencies that provide that.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:15:50):**  Just report and verify.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:15:51):**  And so you can use that public weather to confirm an event and then you can potentially  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:15:55):**  use satellite to confirm the loss from say the day before to the day after.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:16:00):**  And there's different companies doing that and the models can be difficult to figure  
**[0:16:04-0:16:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:16:04):**  out what the mass of that, would there be NDVI or something like that.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:16:08):**  Then the other one is usage based insurance which is more focused on actually how the  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:16:12):**  farmer operates.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:16:13):**  And so you can use specific data from whether how frequently they spray certain operational  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:16:18):**  tools.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:16:19):**  And even on the weather side, more localized stations that a farmer may have.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:16:23):**  And so that's how a farmer can differentiate.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:16:26):**  And that's definitely a small space, but certainly is quite exciting, I think for a lot of people  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:16:33):**  to do to get better pricing and maybe generally more micro layers of insurance.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:16:38):**  So maybe you're getting rather than one big bulky $20 policy that you get in the spring,  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:16:43):**  maybe you're getting 10 different $2 policies throughout or something like that.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:16:48):**  Maybe probably be complimentary where you're getting maybe one $15 policy in two or three  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:16:52):**  small policies is maybe what I would expect.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:16:55):**  But every time we spray or apply nutrition, we're de-risking our crop.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:00):**  And so one would think you should have the appropriate de-risked insurance price as well.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:05):**  Are you seeing new innovations come in this space?  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:07):**  Are you getting startup companies calling or talking to you?  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:10):**  Or are you seeing new offerings or are there pretty big barriers to entry for innovators?  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:15):**  Yes, the industry is actually kind of segmented in terms of reinsurers, insurers, managing  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:19):**  general agents, and then just more like front end kind of pricing sales agencies and not  
**[0:17:24-0:17:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:24):**  even agencies, just companies.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:25):**  Yeah, there is lots of new ones and they're able to grow because they can tap the balance  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:29):**  sheets of the insurers and the reinsurers.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:31):**  So we've seen some, some are interesting.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:34):**  There's one here in Canada on the usage side.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:36):**  I think the parametric weather side is exciting.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:39):**  And I don't think anyone really cracked the code there.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:42):**  Can you give me the one-on-one on what parametric insurance is?  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:45):**  It's just, it's almost binary.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:47):**  Did this weather event occur or not occur?  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:49):**  So did you have X number of days over a certain heat threshold?  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:52):**  And so that would be when you use that weather industry, it would pay off.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:56):**  Or if you had a frost, it would automatically pay off.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:17:59):**  If it, you had too much moisture, a certain period, it would automatically pay off.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:18:02):**  And so that's just a specific parallel over a specific timeframe with immediate or just  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:18:07):**  about immediate payoff because you're not, there's no claims management process that's  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:18:10):**  based upon the actual changes to the crop or to the revenue.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:18:14):**  It's simply did this weather event occur or not occur.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:18:19):**  And why I could see why that's appealing to a company to build a product like that, because  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:18:23):**  it decreases your cost base and the claims aspect is much simpler for a farmer.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:18:28):**  Why would a parametric insurance product be appealing?  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:18:32):**  Lower premiums.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:18:33):**  So if you can get to the same outcome or the same goal of you're, you're always insuring  
**[0:18:38-0:18:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:18:38):**  against weather, but this is more specific.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:18:40):**  And so if there's no legacy claims management process, you're saving costs there in the  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:18:47):**  premium as well as if you're actually only insuring over a specific period of time, that's  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:18:52):**  going to cost less.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:18:53):**  Obviously you're not getting as much coverage, but one would, one could argue that maybe  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:18:57):**  your risk periods are that there's only a few very high risk periods over a sale of  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:19:02):**  a farming season, and you only need to be insured for say three weeks and not six months.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:19:06):**  But so there's definitely lower premiums and then just more specific payouts as they're  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:19:10):**  going to be a lot of, again, again, the information asymmetry and the adverse selection that comes  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:19:14):**  up on the claims management process goes both ways and can be quite stressful for a farmer  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:19:19):**  to deal with.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:19:21):**  As the industry changes, whether that's more weather new innovations in this space, more  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:19:24):**  digital technology, layers of insurance, how or do you see the skillset of a farmer needing  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:19:30):**  to change to adapt to the changing role of insurance?  
**[0:19:35-0:19:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:19:35):**  I don't think it actually need to be that extreme because we're already making those  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:19:38):**  same decisions, it can just be a slightly different premium.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:19:41):**  So we'll have to maybe make more scenario analysis of what this means to our balance  
**[0:19:45-0:19:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:19:45):**  sheet in our income statement.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:19:48):**  Throughout the year, we're usually at the moment, it's simply just if this, if the,  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:19:51):**  our yield drops by X percent, we'll get X dollars or Y dollars.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:19:55):**  And then this scenario, you may have different scenario bets on depending on the parametric  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:20:00):**  or usage based product that you have, that's maybe more in season payouts than simply the  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:20:05):**  fall or end of harvest payout.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:20:07):**  You mentioned the changes in the biotech space have changed the insurance landscape or where

**[0:20:19-0:20:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:20:19):**  and how equipment's being used.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:20:21):**  Could you imagine insurance being tied more to practices and products and embedded in  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:20:26):**  other aspects of what you're buying and managing as a farmer?  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:20:30):**  I hope so.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:20:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:20:32):**  I hope so because I think any change in, if insurance is your main risk management tool,  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:20:40):**  any change in your business, whether it costs up, costs down, efficient, always changes  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:20:44):**  your risk profile.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:20:45):**  And so your risk management tool should change accordingly.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:20:50):**  As I was building out my own understanding of how ag insurance works and what role tech  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:20:53):**  might play in transforming it, I knew that one map simply wouldn't be enough.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:20:57):**  So I also huddled with Matthew, my co-founder at Tenacious Ventures.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:21:01):**  He had a chance to talk to some different experts and learn about the sector from a  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:21:04):**  slightly different perspective, specifically from the perspective of people and companies  
**[0:21:09-0:21:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:21:09):**  that are looking to make ag insurance more digitally native.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:21:12):**  We started our conversation at the same place that Matt Coutts and I started with the question  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:21:16):**  of how farmers think about risk.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:21:18):**  Here's Matthew.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:21:19):**  The way farmers think about risk is a kind of continuum that crosses from marketing and  
**[0:21:27-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:21:27):**  prices and mechanisms to both secure supply and to remove variability from sale prices.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:21:38):**  So forward contracting, options, futures, those are things that relate to unpredictability  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:21:46):**  in the direct costs of production and the direct benefit, right?  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:21:51):**  The direct sort of price that you achieve.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:21:54):**  And then the other class of risk are the things that you don't directly control as a rule,  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:22:00):**  which would be up to and including weather-related risk, which would be the primary one.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:22:06):**  And the overall observation we have in a digitally native world is that these things typically  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:22:13):**  have resisted digitization largely, but you still go to your banker for this particular  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:22:19):**  thing or you go to a grain marketing channel specifically for the elements around securing  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:22:24):**  price and your marketing choices.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:22:27):**  You go to a specific underwriter or agent or broker for the insurance part.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:22:33):**  And so I think there are two things that are interesting about re-imagining those when  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:22:38):**  they're digitally native.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:22:39):**  But the first is that it almost certainly has an impact on channel, right?  
**[0:22:44-0:22:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:22:44):**  They're not digital channels, there isn't the kind of digital funnel for the most part.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:22:51):**  The front end to it is human, is rigid, isn't tailored to you.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:22:57):**  Like when you buy crop insurance, you'll sit down with a specialist broker and they will  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:23:05):**  already have a set of policies that are pre-baked, right?  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:23:10):**  That are determined by the kind of risk.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:23:15):**  So I guess broadly speaking, there's a structural element to it.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:23:20):**  So these risk management options that a farmer has access to are the way they are because  
**[0:23:28-0:23:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:23:28):**  of market structure and the flexibility that they have or the ability to be tailored is  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:23:36):**  limited because of that.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:23:38):**  And secondarily, in some ways they are the way they are because they're also non-digital.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:23:43):**  So the other reason that they're often not very flexible is because they're not fully  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:23:49):**  digital in nature.  
**[0:23:50-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:23:50):**  And so the kind of insurance you can buy or the sorts of grain marketing and cost protection  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:24:00):**  alternatives you have access to are the ones that somebody designed based on what happened  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:24:04):**  last season or 10 seasons ago or something like that.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:24:08):**  When you say not digital, the obvious way that plays out is that the timescale is off  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:24:15):**  in that you're like using last year's models, last season's, whatever.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:24:18):**  Like it's not that there isn't digital technology modeling it or you're not getting whatever.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:24:21):**  It's that it's not real time and it's leveraging the tools that we now have to know things  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:24:29):**  at a more precise level and to react in more real time.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:24:32):**  Is that what you mean?  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:24:33):**  It can be both.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:24:34):**  Certainly it's not to imply that there isn't technology there, but they're not digitally  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:24:38):**  native certainly.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:24:40):**  And they don't necessarily leverage all the benefits of digital native agriculture.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:24:45):**  So yes, what we mean by that is to say for sure the underwriter will have used technology  
**[0:24:51-0:24:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:24:51):**  to model their risk, to decide what policies that they were going to put into what markets.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:24:58):**  But because they're not thinking about the customer experience, they're thinking about  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:25:02):**  their risk, they will have just decided what policies they want to offer, what grains in  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:25:08):**  what markets and then put those into their highly structured marketplace to the master  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:25:14):**  general agent who will then give it to their brokers, who will then trade in their sales  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:25:17):**  people, who will then go and offer those things.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:25:21):**  Can you explain that again, answering a different question, which is like how the market structure  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:25:24):**  works now?  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:25:25):**  Because I think that's important.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:25:26):**  To save you the trouble of me fumbling my way through learning out loud, let's just  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:25:29):**  agree that insurance is wickedly complex.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:25:32):**  But what I think is important to point out is that the key principle roles are basically  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:25:36):**  around underwriting, which is about quantifying the risk in detail and calculating the prices  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:25:42):**  and costs of insuring against those risks.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:25:46):**  Insurance is more the commercial aspect of enabling the policies or contracts to be purchased  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:25:51):**  against those specific risks.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:25:53):**  There are also usually a few layers of other commercial entities between the underwriting  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:25:57):**  insuring entities and the ultimate end customer.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:26:01):**  And those are roughly distribution style activities like agents and matchmaking style activities  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:26:06):**  like brokers and even retailers.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:26:09):**  Now this is a dramatic oversimplification and entities will often perform more than  
**[0:26:14-0:26:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:26:14):**  one role.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:26:15):**  But for the purposes of our analysis, the key phases are the risk and policy part, the  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:26:20):**  distribution part and the selling part.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:26:23):**  Because the way those work in agricultural insurance seem important to us in looking  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:26:28):**  at what might change.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:26:29):**  They seem important for two key reasons.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/06/15/how-does-agricultural-insurance-work-explainer#t=0:26:32):**  One because the structure very much impacts the sort of insurance policies available and

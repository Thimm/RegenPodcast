### Agtech - So What?  (2022-00-13)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  I'm Sarah Nolet.  The idea of preserving the planet for future generations has been a staple of environmental  movements all over the world for decades.  But for those of us who work on keeping the planet livable every day, the narrative and,  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:18):**  well, the imperative, has become much more urgent.  We're often staring down in human career timelines, which I feel like a lot of us are more sensitive  to, that like in my career, while I work on this project, I could watch the end of this  wild caught fishery.  Like me personally, not my hypothetical kid.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:34):**  And I think that just does something to folks in terms of turning up the intensity of needing  to find the solutions.  That's Emma Fuller, carbon and ecosystems global portfolio manager at Corteva.  Emma brings an unusual science-focused background to the ag carbon space and has used that background  combined with a diligent focus on creating value for farmers and an ability to top dollars  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:54):**  and cents to shape her work.  Our conversation with Emma started with a question that I struggle with myself.  It was inspired by a story Emma recently authored where she voiced optimism about the achievability  of radical change in the global food and ag space.  As someone who at times struggles with that optimism, I started by asking Emma where hers  
**[0:01:15-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:15):**  comes from.  I think it comes from two spots.  The first is that fundamentally farms are businesses and they track incentives just  like we all do.  And so we have the system that we have today because we've paid for it and because we've  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:31):**  made it profitable and lucrative to farm in a particular way.  And so as those shifts change, what I expect will have to happen alongside those shifts  is that people will be willing to pay for different things.  And if people are willing to pay for different things, then there's a pathway for folks and  especially younger farmers that are willing to do more experimentation, which we often  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:47):**  see a difference based on how long you've been in farming, willingness to make that  change, that you might see that.  So that's where the optimism comes from, but it is crucial that the paying for the changes  is a big part of that.  And a lot of what I have experienced is a lot of saying we want new things and not wanting  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:04):**  to pay for it.  And so that's why we're like, ah, it's so hard.  And indeed it is very hard to get radical change without any writing of checks to underwrite  that radical change.  Yeah, totally.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:15):**  And we'll get into that.  I guess your role now, I would say is kind of the introduction of carbon and data.  Like how did you end up there?  Can I tell me about your path to where you are today?  Let's see.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:26):**  I started out in commercial fisheries, very related to row crop farming.  So food systems overall.  My interest has always been on how do we deal with these systems that have both big environmental  footprints and huge impact to human communities, whether it's food or fiber or fuel or whatever.  So I got out of Wildcat Fisheries and I thought, wow, what's more impactful than fisheries?  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:43):**  Farming came to mind in agriculture.  So I jumped out of my PhD and joined granular as a startup as a data scientist, mostly with  the observation that how people respond to incentives matters more than almost anything  else that you can study.  And crafting policy or crafting new businesses that address incentives are going to be the  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:00):**  biggest way to shape systems in the way that we want them to be.  So backing up from that, how do you understand what the incentives are?  It's talking to people.  I was talking to fishermen in my PhD, even though I was working with data and I was an  ecologist, it was talking to farmers and working at granular as the data scientists would be  
**[0:03:14-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:14):**  like, okay, what data?  What data do you actually have to make your decisions on?  And how do you weight that data yourself as a farmer?  And then how do you use that to make decisions?  That was what drew me to granular.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:21):**  And so from there have just been hunting for opportunities where you can provide incentives  for farmers that will help under underwrite their changes, which has sort of led me to  carbon, which is a wild bet, but one that I think is worth making.  As you've been kind of in this world, both in fisheries and now in agriculture, how have  you been seeing the conversation around like sustainability broadly, and I guess, regen  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:45):**  or regeneration kind of change over the course of your career?  I think it used to be, it was much more frosting than I feel like it is today where, oh, that's  nice.  It's off in the corner and we like to do a few press releases on that.  And now it feels much more fundamental to the whole enterprise.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:00):**  Is this going to continue in its current frame for the next 10 years, the next 15 years?  Like we're often staring down in human career timelines, which I feel like a lot of us are  more sensitive to that, like in my career, while I work on this project, I could watch  the end of this wild caught fishery, like me personally, not my hypothetical kid.  And I think that just does something to folks in terms of turning up the intensity of needing  
**[0:04:20-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:20):**  to find the solutions.  I also think we've gone through a couple of waves around climate in terms of the importance  and like insane urgency that we are continuing to be bared down on that front.  And that sort of went through a wave in 2008, 2009 that sort of fell apart with the, at  least in the U S with this failure of cap and trade to go all the way through.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:37):**  And then it's been really bottoming out and just coming right back up.  And I think that's the other thing of all of this speaks to the entire system, right?  The entire system is what the problem is and we have to address the entire system to solve  it.  And a big part of that is quote unquote sustainability and a realization that even just maintaining  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:52):**  where we are in the status quo, which some people refer to as sustainability not going  to be enough.  And we legitimately have to turn back the clock on emissions and regenerate, rebuild  a lot of these systems.  Was that part of the mission at granular and that kind of sustainability as core to how  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:06):**  you guys thought about what you were doing and how you thought about go to market incentive  design or was that sort of a by-product tell me a bit more about that journey.  I think it depends on how you frame sustainability.  A lot of times, like I said, people think of it as the separate thing.  The focus at granular is about how do you drive value for farmers?  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:23):**  How do they make the most valuable, profitable decisions they can, and how do they like meld  all of those different data sources, whether it's your genetics of the hybrid that you're  planting or the crop that you're choosing or the way that you market it or the way that  you put down nitrogen, like how do you bring all of those things together as opposed to  just a focus on yields, which is also really true, actually in fisheries.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:39):**  Like you get the same coffee shop talk that I was hearing about in farming with fishermen.  They'll come in, they'll go to the coffee shop and talk about their catch, but they  didn't talk about their gas, like how long they spent out there and how hard they fished.  So anyway, that same sort of focus on aggregate yields only gets you so far.  And so it's instead really on profit.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:55):**  And I think that's where sustainability is not called out explicitly in that, but to  the extent that sustainability is like a systemic part of how you make your business decisions  is because it adds value at some level to your operation.  And so that focus on value actually, I think helped hone my strategic thinking on sustainability  very quickly, because I put up lots of ideas of we could quantify butterfly habitat and  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:17):**  leadership was like, are they going to pay for our software because we have butterfly  habitat in it?  And I was like, oh yeah, there's no value.  It might like for a small tail that really care about butterflies might drive value,  but not going to drive value for the majority of folks that are trying to improve their  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:30):**  businesses.  And so if we make that link explicitly back to how that drives profit or value for the  farmer, we weren't going to get any adoption, which was a useful shortcut to not spend a  bunch of time and have a sandbox to do butterfly habitat and then try to bring it to market.  So I was going to ask, was it surprising to you leaving academia company, this world thinking  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:47):**  about being out, I would say a mission oriented person and kind of thinking about the impact  side of things, what you learned about agriculture and how strong those incentives are?  What was that like for you?  It was a pretty rude awakening.  I think as a scientist, I was like, I'm sure the gap here is science.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:02):**  As a scientist, I am uniquely suited to be the solution here.  Not true.  It wasn't a lack of data.  Wasn't a lack of ability to quantify these impacts, which is what I emerged out of academia,  thinking that's my thesis.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:12):**  Like we just need to connect the pipes and I can send great science upwards and consumers  will pay for it.  And what's missing is like that sort of pipe connection, hence data science, hence that  sort of approach.  Not true.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:22):**  The willing, the failure was willingness to pay.  And that was the, that was a pretty rude awakening, I think for me, but a good one.  Right.  So a lot of us that are in academia at some points in our lives, like to figure out how  things work.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:32):**  And so that was like a, quite a shortcut to figuring out, Oh, that's what's going on here.  And not get distracted by these other scientific uncertainties or blah, blah.  It's just people don't want to write checks.  So we got to figure out how they want to write checks.  Other than proposing the butterfly habitat tool, any examples of how that kind of rude  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:48):**  awakening happened?  Was it through talking to farmers or proposing ideas internally?  How did that kind of manifest for you?  Coming from all directions, which was also reaffirming in terms of certainty I felt in,  in receiving this message.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:59):**  Some of it was farmers.  So we have a huge spectrum of customers from folks that are doing fairly standard conventional  practices that are no cover crop sort of standard tillage standard corn, soy rotation approach.  And then you have folks all the way in the other end of the spectrum that are doing five  to seven crop rotations that are doing multi-species cover crops, interseeding, experimenting with  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:18):**  all sorts of tillage, working on buffer habitat, like just doing all of the things.  And I think what was true about that tale of farmers was either that they personally  cared quite a lot about those out and valued biodiversity, valued soil health, value that  stuff personally separate from what returns they were able to quantify on their balance  sheet and, or they had very unique market opportunities where they could sell to a whiskey  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:42):**  distillery or had ways to capture value out of that additional work that they were doing.  So that was one observation, like several farms had that and it was like, Oh, that that's  hard to replicate, right?  Like that you're in Colorado and have this particular hookup with this buyer.  Like, how would I go to someone in Illinois and find that same opportunity for them?  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:59):**  Or how would they do that regardless of whether or not they need granular software to do that  for them?  So that was one piece.  And then it was also honestly when granular was a startup, before we joined part of Courteva,  trying to work with some of the bigger actors in ag in the supply chain and saying, look  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:11):**  at all the stuff that we can do for you at a field level or looking at field to market,  for example, and saying, how can we embed this?  And realizing that I couldn't find people who were willing to pay the time it would  take for software engineers.  And I couldn't find value for farmers and taking that back to them and being like, here's  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:26):**  a field to market calculator.  What would you do with it?  And they were like, nothing.  So that was disappointing and frustrating to realize like there's tools out there that  are ready made to sort of quantify these impacts.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:34):**  And through trying to shop those around, honestly, was what sort of convinced me that I couldn't  also, I could be a terrible salesperson likely true, but it also felt like the thing I was  trying to sell was I think that no one was really willing to pay for.  Emma was not in an official sales role at granular any more than anyone is in a sales  role when they work for a relatively small startup.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:52):**  But she learned a lot from the activity of selling her science to customers.  When granular was acquired by what is now Corteva in 2018, and she migrated to the new  company, her vision for new possibilities broadened, but continued to be informed by  that early experience.  Being an academic, it's one thing to jump out of academia into industry, I think.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:12):**  And there was one thing to jump into a startup.  And then it's another thing to really be hoovered up into the belly of the beast in terms of  like real industry.  Like those not, we're not messing around anymore.  This is not like a fun startup idea.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:21):**  This is real.  So that was definitely surprising and not any place that I would have expected myself  to be.  That said, I really loved it because it's entities like Corteva, like Syngenta, like  Cargut.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:32):**  Like these are the ones where decisions get made that affect millions and millions of  acres.  And so understanding what is prioritized, how it's prioritized, how you make decisions,  like how you drive business.  And I think that same lesson that I learned at Granular, like it needs to drive value.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:45):**  And so understanding really what are the levers that can connect sustainability or regenerative  agriculture to business value is what I'm super interested to understand.  To what extent can the private sector be an engine and a solution?  Because it's obvious that the private sector can move at a million miles an hour when it  needs to, when there's money on the table.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:03):**  And that's the world I think we live in right now that we need to move at about a million  miles an hour to start solving some of those climate issues.  And so can we start to put the pieces together of like, here's private industry that can  do that given the right incentives.  What as a scientist, as someone who's got some technical background, can I start to  
**[0:11:17-0:11:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:17):**  get the shape of that question and look for those overlaps that might be missed?  And a lot of times I think people like me don't end up in places like Corteva.  And so there's actually quite a large sandbox to play in of no one's looked at it from this  angle before.  Like I can go to town and put out some crazy ideas and some of them might stick, which  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:30):**  is how it got to carbon, which was this realization of I think ecosystem services as a framework  for folks that are in conservation biology or come from that background, it's going to  be a really familiar term, even though it's jargon to 99.9% of everyone else.  But that framework of there are things that we value that come from natural systems.  That always made a lot of sense to me as a way to think about how do we value nature?  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:51):**  How do we value natural systems?  And when it became clear that people were willing to start paying for carbon, that sort  of is what changed the game.  Yes, we can measure it.  Yes, we can quantify it.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:01):**  Then money and incentives have to be there.  And that's what's been missing.  And so as that started to shift was like, wow, we're dealing with a world in which farmers  can get value, not just for the practices, but the actual outcomes of what they're doing  on their field, which is an amazing angle for farmers to make choices about what makes  
**[0:12:18-0:12:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:18):**  sense for their operation.  Cause we know the same practice everywhere is not appropriate.  It also had a nice layer onto the digital strategy, which is it's requires a lot of  data.  And so you need to be having doing digital record keeping in some form granular is one  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:29):**  approach to that.  So there was an angle there on our own approach to value of data.  And then there's this just huge revenue opportunity for farmers and folks that can help farmers  access that revenue.  And so all of a sudden now there's business value and we've got real environmental value.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:42):**  And this is clear that this is not an established market, but it's a bet worth taking because  it checks the boxes in a sort of structural way.  That makes sense from how the business case has come together now and looking in hindsight  as it was coming together to do this work for you searching for other possible things  and kind of the macro trends around carbon popped up.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:02):**  Like I know we've seen in the investment side, all the startup pitch decks shifted from AI  to blockchain to carbon.  And so it feels like this kind of hype-y movement, but the way you articulate it is sounds like  a pretty sound business case.  Like how did it evolve?  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:17):**  I initially thought the supply chain was where to play.  So we have consumers on one end that are a demonstrated source of demand for, you can  argue with how demonstrated, right?  There are all sorts of willingness to pay surveys, and then you actually look at market  data and it tells you different stories, depending on how you slice it and which markets.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:29):**  I'm a scientist.  There's some uncertainty in willingness to pay.  Anyway, you start there and you were backwards.  And this is where I joined Granular from.  Consumers simplistically want to pay for more natural, sustainable goods, however you define  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:40):**  that.  I'm going to show up as a scientist and define that for them in a rigorous way that I feel  proud of as a scientist and has some rigor to it.  And we'll just pass it through the supply chain and everyone will get a cut.  Then I learned how complicated commodity supply chains were, right?  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:53):**  There's hen actors that all get cuts of this food after it leaves the farm gate, let alone  the farmer, which means that the value you have to pass through that supply chain has  to be monstrous in order for everyone to get a cut and there still would be something left  for the consumer.  I came to Granular also with this simplistic idea of like you change one acre of corn and  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:11):**  it scales to 180 million.  Wow, that's so cool.  Just one, whatever, you prove it out in one acre.  And that's like super silly thinking.  And yes, the cropping system is more simple than a diversified vegetable rotation, but  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:25):**  the complexity when it leaves the farm gate just blows your mind.  So that was one realization of, okay, this can't go through the supply chain unless there's  a way more value associated with it than we see today.  Okay.  And that was both through talking to farmers, realizing that these very short supply chains  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:39):**  that were very simple could get that value passed all the way through.  And then when we talked to some of the bigger supply chains, them being like the person  ahead of me is not going to pay for that and I'm not going to pay for that.  And I just killed it right there.  Then Emma stumbled on Nori, a carbon marketplace company that we've actually invested in at  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:53):**  Tenacious Ventures.  Emma was intrigued by the fact that granular already had much of the data that Nori would  need from farmers.  And by the fact that Nori's strategy explicitly went outside the traditional supply chain,  meaning more value could make its way to farmers and consumers.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:09):**  This compounded by the opportunity to work at scale and the obvious business fit sealed  the deal.  But for Emma, buying into carbon also went deeper.  Investment in regenerative ag is investment in place.  It's not a thing that like skips and hops from Ohio to, I don't know, Ukraine and then  
**[0:15:25-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:25):**  back.  It's a place that you like commit for years.  And our commodity food system is built to skip around.  And so that's also fundamentally structurally at odds with the kind of investment that you  need to drive change.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:36):**  And that was also a puzzle that like there's a few supply chains that did that.  I think Denone had its like preferred supplier model that was closed to more entrance.  It's so good that it like literally couldn't scale, would not scale because they had their  participants and it was working for the participants, but it wasn't working for all the other farmers.  So that's why carbon just was like, oh, this, if this works, this addresses structurally  
**[0:15:56-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:56):**  so many of the limitations we've seen previously.  So that sort of like formative realization of like the pieces are here now that they  weren't previously and the ability to trial this out on a pretty small scale with a small  startup with a handful of farmers to really understand the value that they would get was  really what unlocked the opportunity to go big and get into the space.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:13):**  So it wasn't quite as hypey as I think sometimes the funding market makes it seem like.  What was the response initially when you started socializing this internally?  Was it easy to align to organizational motivations?  Was there skepticism?  Definite skepticism for sure.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:28):**  I think I was lucky enough that I had been thoughtful enough in my approaches previously  that they essentially said, here's the rope for you to go hang yourself.  This is yours.  If you want to go for it, you can and like good luck.  And I was like, yeah, I do.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:41):**  This is too good of an opportunity in terms of the ways that it fits in to the way I've  been thinking about this to not go after this and it seems like a risk worth taking.  So I really appreciated the independence and freedom I had to prove that out.  And I feel very lucky that we had really dedicated customers to be teachers there and to be like  sanity checkers.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:59):**  And so that sort of long-term relationship with customers was so critical to have that  feedback loop so early that I could also get that sense too, that I wasn't completely off  the deep end and was going to show up on a farm's porch and say, what do you think?  And then be like, this is super dumb.  Don't talk to me about this.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:14):**  Like, did you have any ideas for anyone else was like, that is a horrible idea.  Don't do it.  Like I need that come to mind where you got that feedback and change your mind.  I don't think I did butterflies, but I feel like it was something like that.  I think edge habitat is really hard where there's a lot of value to it from water quality  
**[0:17:28-0:17:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:28):**  and pollination services and habitat connectivity.  But you're also asking farms to grow a lot of potential weeds next door.  Like you're literally asking them to farm weeds or what you act as weeds in their fields  and don't act as weeds outside of their fields.  And that was like, Oh yeah.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:42):**  Oh yeah.  That's what I'm asking.  That's not very thoughtful is it?  So getting feedback early on was pretty helpful for thinking through how would you actually  address that and deal with those unintended consequences.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:51):**  When did things start to gain momentum or have they imagined they have internally where  they're aha moments for others at Corteva going, Oh, this is really starting to make  sense.  Or how have you seen the change internally in people's mindsets and actions?  A couple of unlocks for us.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:05):**  One was just sort of again, addressing the scale, right?  Agriculture is huge, like in the U S and the U S market, right?  It's just millions and millions of acres.  And when you start to be able to provide a solution that can scale the economics work  really well.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:18):**  So that was one big aha.  The other big aha honestly, it was just this explosion of interest in around soil carbon.  I think it was really lucky that I had started with Norian 2018 and then were able to credibly  put together a larger business case to say, you hear a lot of buzz about this.  This is how it would actually work if we applied it to a business.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:33):**  So that was really lucky.  And then honestly, some really healthy competition in the market was very helpful to say, we  got folks knocking on our door with our customers, trying to tempt them away by carbon programs.  What's our answer?  And we were able to step up and say, here's an answer.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:47):**  We thought through it.  We've done some homework, we've tried it out and this can be a good response.  And so I think those things combined really set the stage.  Didn't guarantee that, that we would get alignment, but really helped us drive alignment.  But of those things, you know, people willing to write checks.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:59):**  We talk a lot about water quality or biodiversity credits and ecosystem markets overall.  And I am, I'm an ecologist.  I would love to work on a biodiversity project.  I cannot find people that are really willing to put down durable dollars for that.  And so because we had that for carbon, because we had that for climate change, we can now  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:16):**  build a market for that.  That changes the whole scale of the probability of success for these things is that willingness  to pay.  And tell me, there's a lot in this kind of ecosystem services space that gets lumped  together.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:27):**  It's like carbon, it's biodiversity, it's water.  So I guess give me your definition, like, what are you guys talking about in this program  and how I guess is Corteva doing it?  Walk me through what you guys actually do.  And then we can talk a little bit about how that compares to the competition.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:40):**  So what we are doing is focusing on crediting farmers for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions  or carbon sequestered in their soils.  So that's the environmental outcome that farms get checks on is what are the outcomes of  their practices on that front?  So it does not explicitly include any valuation for biodiversity.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:54):**  It does not explicitly include any valuation for water quality, despite those being really  well-proven statistically sound co-benefits, right?  Those come out of these practices that also happen to be carbon, which is part of the  wonderful story of investing in nature-based systems period.  So just on carbon, what our program is focused on row crops, predominantly in the Midwest,  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:15):**  but stretches out across everywhere you see row crop farming, we're able to offer a program.  And it's really the practices that qualify are adopting cover crop, reducing or eliminating  tillage or addressing nitrogen management.  And those have to be new practices.  Often if you get into the depths of carbon markets, right, additionality is a thing.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:34):**  So because we are not buying these credits ourselves, we are helping these credits go  to offset markets and scope three markets.  We have to abide by what those buyers want.  This is like willingness to pay.  And those buyers want to pay for additional quote, new carbon.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:47):**  Talk about how this doesn't serve early adopters and how unfair that is.  It doesn't serve early adopters and it is unfair.  This is not a silver bullet solution.  And it's got a different soapbox about silver bullets, but it's not a silver bullet.  It's not the only thing that we need to do.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:59):**  It's not the only thing that will work.  The way it works is this is a Corteva carbon program.  So typically farms work with their existing advisors on the farm.  So often a pioneer seed rep or a pioneer agronomist, but anyone, regardless of their customer status  to Corteva can participate.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:12):**  Really we see this as an accelerant to practice change, right?  So these are folks that are often thinking about this.  I'm a should I do it this year or next year?  Should I do 50 acres or a hundred acres?  This is a program that helps you risk those choices and say, do it this year.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:25):**  There's money on the line here.  Do it on a hundred acres, not 50 acres.  So it really accelerates adoption trends.  We work with Indigo on the backend as an MRV.  So the other thing that we took from the get go, which was really informed by our work  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:36):**  with Nori is we can't nor do we want to do it all.  We don't want to own the space.  We want to partner with others and do what we're best at.  And what we're best at is two things.  One, we already work with millions of acres of farmers, with the farmland and with farmers  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:48):**  to make decisions on those farm acres.  And this is just one more decision, right?  One more tool, one more piece of conversation for the right farmer.  And this just helps us get to more farms.  So that's one thing.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:57):**  And then the second thing is that we can bring to bear more innovative solutions, whether  it's nitrogen stabilizers or biologicals or things like that, but the market has to be  there to begin with.  So those are the two places that we want to focus on in this carbon space.  We also really firmly wanted to stay on the side of the farmer.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:11):**  We don't want to be on both sides of the market where we're both trying to get the most money  for a farmer and trying to get the most money for the credit and trying to eat up in between.  And that was the other part of taking that partnership approach.  So we work with Indigo and ESMC as what we call MRVs, so the quantifiers.  So all of these startups that are popping up and pitching, many of them are MRVs, did  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:27):**  not want to play in that space because of the amount of venture capital that was going  into that space and a couple of other reasons.  It's a hard space to be in.  And in particular, we wanted to be honest about the conflict of interest.  So if we are involved with putting our thumb on the scale for how much carbon is being  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:41):**  quantified on that soil and we get paid based on how much carbon is quantified in that soil,  it's not a good place to be given that these are non-physical commodities that you need  to trust really in the rigor of the carbon credit that's being generated in order to  charge that highest premium.  So we wanted to completely structurally stay out of that and really be clear that our role  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:58):**  is with the farm and work with partners that we thought could bring really high quality,  rigorous quantification to the market.  But also honestly our strength is not in selling carbon credits.  Like we don't have that network.  We don't have those skills and we didn't really want to be in that market anyway.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:09):**  So we really wanted to sit on that side of the farmer and support on this agronomic decisions  and decisions whether or not to participate at all.  How has that changed these advisors and these sales reps like boots on the ground behavior?  Are they thinking differently about things that they recommend or how they sell products?  What's changing at the end of the supply chain?  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:27):**  I think I'm already seeing an increased demand and desire to learn more about carbon, right?  So originally people are interested in soil health or they're interested in yield impacts,  but now there's money in caring about how much soil carbon sequestration.  So you see a lot of really sophisticated interest from agronomists and farmers themselves saying,  okay, how does decomposition rates vary as a function of soil mixture and disturbance?  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:49):**  Like sort of levels of stuff that as a scientist, I'm super excited to go deep on, but was not  holding my breath that everyone would be that interested in those dimensions, but a ton  of demand for more knowledge from our channels.  The other thing that's pretty cool to start seeing click into place, and this sort of  goes back to my harping on incentives is someone who personally is really excited about sustainability  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:05):**  and passionate about that space.  I can run around a company all day and be like, well, marketing team could do this and  whatever could do that.  And all of a sudden those connections were happening organically without me needing to  be in the middle.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:15):**  So our marketing team now is like, well, we need to help farms meet that educational need  and start to put together and pull together NRCS and extensions work and other NGOs work  on soil health and regenerative ag.  And that was not because there's a passion project from one person in a company to do  that, which we had have several of those folks in Corteva.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:33):**  There's lots of people passionate about this space, but no business reason to do that.  And it's always swimming upstream, right?  If it's a passion project and it's not a business decision.  And all of a sudden it's a business decision of how do we help farms adopt, not just reduced  till, but also cover crop because we get more carbon per acre.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:47):**  And all of a sudden Corteva makes more money because we get less than 25% of that credit.  Most of it goes to the farm, but we get part of that credit.  And so we want to maximize those credits too.  So it's just all of a sudden, like that stuff started clicking into place of now we start  to have impact and business returns at the same time, which that's the dream, right?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:04):**  When you talk about impact and you talk about like private sector being a force for good,  and that just started to happen.  So all of those things started falling into place in a way that you're like, okay, I could  see the path for how businesses then start to scale and be part of the solution.  If pricing rules are set, right?  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:18):**  What are the weak points of the work right now?  What are the challenges?  Is it reliable data or be a farmer resistance or adoption, or what are some of the challenges?  One to be really candid about is that the price of carbon is not high enough to drive  the scale of change that we need to see.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:32):**  So for a farmland to be a climate solution, we need to be on millions and millions of  acres, 20, 50, 100 million acres.  This is not a 10,000 acre game.  So right now the price of carbon, we're seeing anywhere from 15 to $40 a ton, depending on  which buyer it's which time in the market, that's already a lot higher than it was.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:48):**  Like I think we're starting at 15 and now we're really seeing 40 should pop up a lot  more.  So that's even in the span of less than 12 months, quite an aggressive rise.  But that said, it still doesn't fully offset the costs of adopting these practices, which  is worth being candid about.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:26:02):**  And until we see the price of carbon offset the full amount of adopting cover crop, paying  for cover crop seed, doing that seeding pass and termination pass, it's going to be a slow  climb.  And you're going to accelerate the existing adoption trends, but you're not going to move  it at the scale that you need to on the timeframe that you need to address climate change.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:26:18):**  That's one thing to call out that you just need to see a higher price of carbon.  And that's the bet that we're making that that will come, but it's worth farms effort  and to be ready for that upside.  Another challenge is candidly, like there's not a lot of standards for quality in these  assets.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:26:32):**  People have acted that left, right and center.  And so the way we handle that as defaulting to transparency, we went with Indigo in part  because they use the, this is jargon, the climate action reserves, soil enrichment  protocol, which is basically a recipe for how you quantify these assets.  It's publicly available.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:26:46):**  And especially they have to publish a model validation report, which says how good their  model is.  And so that's not public yet.  It will be public shortly.  That will give everyone an opportunity to say, how good is this?  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:26:57):**  And that's lacking for almost every other MRV that we've seen is that's not public and  there's no plans to make it public.  And that's concerning to us because unless you have a third party standard that says  the commodity has to be this accurate, you can do all sorts of crazy things under the  rug.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:27:11):**  And I think that's a risk to the industry.  It's a risk to farmers.  It's a risk to everyone engaged in carbon markets that it can undercut this very legitimate  solution to climate change by that lack of standardization.  So that I think would be very helpful also is to have some conclusions from whether it's  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:27:25):**  government or other third party bodies that don't have skin in the game in terms of making  money on these credits to set some standards about how accurate is accurate enough.  Another challenge is how slow and complicated climate accounting is at a corporate level  and in supply chains.  It's really hard to understand exactly who is responsible to pay for what in a supply  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:27:41):**  chain.  And that's really hard to put together a business on top of that.  And so we're waiting for some of these big guidance docs to come through this summer.  And it's like three months, six months, and when your goalpost is 2030, every three months  really matters.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:27:53):**  Every quarter really matters.  Knowing that it's going to take another year to set up a business and work out the kinks.  So that's also been hard to understand exactly scope three of the engines and levers we can  play.  What other thoughts or observations do you have about the way these ag carbon markets  
**[0:28:04-0:28:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:04):**  are currently set up?  Is everything that's happening good?  And we've got to throw a bunch of darts at the wall to figure out what's going to stick.  What's your overall view on how they're currently set up?  I think there's a lot of things that I obviously like about carbon markets, right?  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:17):**  This ability to divorce impact on the ground from supply chains, I think is a really helpful  thing just based on the way that commodity ag is structured today and the kinds of disconnect  you have between investment in a place and ability to literally hop around as a buyer  and go everywhere you want.  If we want change to happen at scale in agriculture in the next five years, I don't think we're  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:37):**  going to rewrite our commodity system.  And so how do we make change inside that existing commodity system?  Acknowledging there are limitations.  This is not to excuse lack of progress in other dimensions, but I think that's just  an acknowledgement that's worth having.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:50):**  This is an engine that can unlock change in our current system today, which is what we  need to do along with rethinking where we go in the next 15 to 30 years.  So I think that's working really well.  I also think what's working really well is focus on outcomes.  Outcomes just again, snap this incentives into place.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:04):**  If you say that cover crops is what you need to do everywhere, right?  And you get paid per acre.  Cover crops, it's very hard to do cover crops in the Northern Plains.  It's very hard to put in and get germination after you harvest corn when it gets so cold  so fast and you have to do interseeding, which adds a whole new set of barriers for practices.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:20):**  So instead of saying tillage is what's appropriate here, but what's appropriate is like sequestering  carbon and you can choose however you want to get there, whatever makes sense for your  farm and hang on those outcomes is what we actually care about.  When we all stop and think about it, I don't think all of us really care that much about  cover crops.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:34):**  We care about what the cover crops do to the soil, what it does to nutrient availability  and what it does to carbon sequestration.  So let's give farmers who know their businesses best the independence and flexibility to make  those choices.  So I love those things about it.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:45):**  I think some of the things that are frustrating about the space focus on silver bullets or  either or conversations.  So one, somehow a carbon market is going to solve all the things like including equity,  right?  Of big farms, small farms, underserved farms, like it's not designed to do that.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:00):**  Those are important issues, but to try to make one policy or market solution solve all  the issues, sets it up for failure and undercuts what progress it can make against important  goals.  The other thing that's frustrating is the dichotomy between engineered and nature-based  solutions period of which soil carbon fits into that, which there was an article in the  
**[0:30:17-0:30:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:17):**  New York Times, how trees are not going to solve all the problems.  And I got pretty frustrated reading that article, but then realized, okay, the audience here  is probably not me who's trying to do a nature-based solution.  Instead it's corporations that are thinking, oh, let's put this off and buy a couple of  trees in the future.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:32):**  That's how we solve it.  And I think that was pitched out, but the way that it was like editorialized in the  New York Times was like news break, trees are going to not do anything, which I think  sets us back a lot in this conversation.  And I think we should be thoughtful about how we do that, which is to say, if we are  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:46):**  in a world where it's either nature-based solutions or it's engineered solutions, we're  screwed.  We're totally screwed.  Like that end of story.  If we're in that like either or world, no solution is happening.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:58):**  We need all the tools at all the scales all the time to make a change, which is why climate  change is so daunting and so scary.  And so I think that's a frustrating thing in the conversation where people are like,  it's not exactly the same as engineered.  No, but it's available today at scale today.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:12):**  And your engineered solutions are going to be available at scale maybe in five years.  So let's do this now and keep working on that.  And that's the solution.  So I think those are some of the things that are frustrating about it.  How do you think about the challenge of farms themselves not being carbon neutral?  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:27):**  Like they have a footprint that they have through whatever use of diesel, fertilizer,  et cetera, et cetera.  And then they're selling these offsets to other industries.  Does that pose a challenge to you at all?  The way that I've been thinking about it is to stay within one and a half degrees of warming.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:44):**  The sort of standard approach there is to say we have to be net zero by 2050, which  is not to say that we're emitting no CO2, no greenhouse gases.  It's just that whatever we're emitting is being sequestered out of the atmosphere.  So net, we're not adding anything new and then we go down from there.  So you can tune at a macro scale, lots of industries up and down.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:00):**  You can say, okay, industrial concrete is going to go down and electrical vehicles is  going to be great.  And you can turn all those and make all the assumptions.  Almost every single set of pathways of what those are called for those of us that are  not steeped in that all every day, most of them have emissions and ag as a global industry,  
**[0:32:15-0:32:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:15):**  right?  We're not saying that ag is going to go down to zero emissions with this because of this  acknowledgement that right now it takes fossil fuels to run equipment.  There is like emissions from livestock.  There's emissions from rice.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:29):**  There's emissions from N2O directly off of fields where nitrogen is applied.  Like all of those things are a reality and tuning down food production is not what we're  trying to do for the most part, right?  That's not really a viable pathway to say, well, just produce half as many calories and  that will be fine.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:42):**  The fact that farms themselves are not carbon neutral is not inherently flawed.  What's important is that you can accurately measure their baseline and show that baseline  is changing because that's what's going to drive the change.  And these macro things, it's really hard to say, are they doing enough?  Are they cutting enough?  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:56):**  But again, I let the price signals drive that of if these emissions are valuable enough  to cut, they will become more valued as a thing and farms can make their own decisions  of whether or not it makes sense for them to tune their grain drying to use less diesel  fuel on their grain dryer because it pays them to do so.  And that's the way to get at this and not try to say everyone has to be zero and then  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:13):**  you can go down from there because you like put additional barriers in front of change  that can happen in the system if you do that.  As you think about the future of this space and of your work, do you think that like the  carbon ecosystem services work could cannibalize some of Corteva's other products or cause  broader shifts in the organization?  
**[0:33:32-0:33:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:32):**  How do you see that changing?  Yeah, I think this is an investment in market formation that adds value to a bunch of Corteva's  CP and like other sustainable tools.  So nitrogen stabilizers are a good example.  They're on the market today, not because of their end to own impact, but because of their  
**[0:33:46-0:33:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:46):**  ability to cut synthetic nitrogen needs and save farmers money.  That said, there's also a very credible story to be told about how it reduces end to own  emissions.  And today that value doesn't get priced into stabilizers for Corteva.  And so I think by developing these markets that are going to pay for climate impacts  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:00):**  means that it opens up a whole nother dimension for Corteva to start investing in and input  companies more generally to start being the engine to develop tools that address not only  the agronomic needs on the field, but also climate, like starts to capture some of that  climate benefit that soils and farmland has.  And so this investment for Corteva in developing our carbon program and continuing to see strengthening  
**[0:34:18-0:34:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:18):**  of carbon markets more generally provides another market for Corteva itself to sell  into.  We started the conversation with kind of consumer preferences being a driver here and then talking  about how maybe they're not so much of a driver for sustainability given all the challenges  we've talked about.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:33):**  Do you see like better quantification of nutritional outcomes if we kind of zoom out and look forward  as a lever?  And do you think that would change the potential pull through from consumers and help us overcome  this challenge of supply chain complexity?  Definitely I see nutrition and convenience is actually the two biggest drivers in consumer  
**[0:34:51-0:34:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:51):**  preferences and sustainability is a fast follow.  So if you have a nutrition angle and there's a sustainability angle, like you're doing  great.  So some of this regenerative farming, especially on milk and trace minerals and stuff in milk  because of forage improvement and then quality of milk because it goes to the cow and better  
**[0:35:06-0:35:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:06):**  health there.  I think that's really interesting.  Also some recent work about bioavailability and produce, right?  And often it decays really fast.  So you have to have very fresh produce to see these signals in.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:16):**  But if you get that very fresh produce that is in regeneratively farmed soils that are  much more healthy, you start to see X, Y, and Z nutrition.  I think we're really hitching ourselves to a rocket when those things start to come.  The personalized nutrition work, which I think has lost some cache recently as I don't know,  we're thinking about blockchain and whatever else we're thinking about these days.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:33):**  But if that breaks through and we start to discover those links, I think that's huge.  Convenience is the other side.  So far I've been disappointed that sustainability, but also feeling more pragmatic about it,  but that so far has not been the driver that we need to see to have that kind of change  in the supply chain for commodities.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:48):**  Emma's experience coming into the ag carbon space really resonated with me and her story  offers some useful insights for those looking to wade into the space themselves.  First I think Emma's view about the gap being in the willingness to pay and not the presence  or quality of the science is super critical.  We talked to a lot of people, academics, startups, and even industry scientists who are still  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:10):**  firmly in the camp where Emma started, but obsessive focus on the science or tech while  ignoring the wants and needs of the people who will actually use it is its own problem,  not a solution.  The two insights that Emma pointed to in explaining why they went the route of partnership versus  alternatives are also critical because of the length and complexity of traditional supply  
**[0:36:30-0:36:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:30):**  chains and the extraordinary challenge of scale, particularly in US markets, Emma believed  it didn't make sense to tackle the building of a whole carbon system.  Instead she teamed up with Nori and later Indigo Ag and was able to leverage partnerships  to follow a different path.  This makes sense on both sides as supply chain partners will inevitably have a lower cost  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:50):**  of customer acquisition given they're already talking to farmers.  Finally what Emma said about positioning Corteva on the side of the farmer is really important.  I so appreciated her recognition and candid comments around the fact that when a company  is both responsible for measuring an intangible commodity and for selling it, this creates  a serious conflict of interest that undermines confidence, not just of consumers, but also  
**[0:37:13-0:37:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:37:13):**  customers.  I think this is a consideration that many in the carbon space are taking too lightly,  which creates risks that confidence in the whole ag carbon sector could erode over time.  We'll be watching closely as more companies enter the space and as consolidation and exits  impact these conflicts of interest over time.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:37:30):**  For now, that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.

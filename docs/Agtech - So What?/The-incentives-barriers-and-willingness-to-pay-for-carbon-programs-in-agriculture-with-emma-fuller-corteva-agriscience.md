**[0:00:05-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:05):**  I'm Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:07):**  The idea of preserving the planet for future generations has been a staple of environmental  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:12):**  movements all over the world for decades.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:14):**  But for those of us who work on keeping the planet livable every day, the narrative and,  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:18):**  well, the imperative, has become much more urgent.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:22):**  We're often staring down in human career timelines, which I feel like a lot of us are more sensitive  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:27):**  to, that like in my career, while I work on this project, I could watch the end of this  
**[0:00:31-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:31):**  wild caught fishery.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:32):**  Like me personally, not my hypothetical kid.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:34):**  And I think that just does something to folks in terms of turning up the intensity of needing  
**[0:00:38-0:00:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:38):**  to find the solutions.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:39):**  That's Emma Fuller, carbon and ecosystems global portfolio manager at Corteva.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:44):**  Emma brings an unusual science-focused background to the ag carbon space and has used that background  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:49):**  combined with a diligent focus on creating value for farmers and an ability to top dollars  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:54):**  and cents to shape her work.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:00:57):**  Our conversation with Emma started with a question that I struggle with myself.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:01):**  It was inspired by a story Emma recently authored where she voiced optimism about the achievability  
**[0:01:07-0:01:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:07):**  of radical change in the global food and ag space.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:10):**  As someone who at times struggles with that optimism, I started by asking Emma where hers  
**[0:01:15-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:15):**  comes from.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:16):**  I think it comes from two spots.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:19):**  The first is that fundamentally farms are businesses and they track incentives just  
**[0:01:25-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:25):**  like we all do.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:26):**  And so we have the system that we have today because we've paid for it and because we've  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:31):**  made it profitable and lucrative to farm in a particular way.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:35):**  And so as those shifts change, what I expect will have to happen alongside those shifts  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:39):**  is that people will be willing to pay for different things.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:41):**  And if people are willing to pay for different things, then there's a pathway for folks and  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:44):**  especially younger farmers that are willing to do more experimentation, which we often  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:47):**  see a difference based on how long you've been in farming, willingness to make that  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:51):**  change, that you might see that.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:53):**  So that's where the optimism comes from, but it is crucial that the paying for the changes  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:57):**  is a big part of that.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:01:59):**  And a lot of what I have experienced is a lot of saying we want new things and not wanting  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:04):**  to pay for it.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:05):**  And so that's why we're like, ah, it's so hard.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:07):**  And indeed it is very hard to get radical change without any writing of checks to underwrite  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:13):**  that radical change.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:14):**  Yeah, totally.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:15):**  And we'll get into that.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:16):**  I guess your role now, I would say is kind of the introduction of carbon and data.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:21):**  Like how did you end up there?  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:22):**  Can I tell me about your path to where you are today?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:25):**  Let's see.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:26):**  I started out in commercial fisheries, very related to row crop farming.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:29):**  So food systems overall.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:31):**  My interest has always been on how do we deal with these systems that have both big environmental  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:34):**  footprints and huge impact to human communities, whether it's food or fiber or fuel or whatever.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:39):**  So I got out of Wildcat Fisheries and I thought, wow, what's more impactful than fisheries?  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:43):**  Farming came to mind in agriculture.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:45):**  So I jumped out of my PhD and joined granular as a startup as a data scientist, mostly with  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:50):**  the observation that how people respond to incentives matters more than almost anything  
**[0:02:54-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:54):**  else that you can study.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:02:56):**  And crafting policy or crafting new businesses that address incentives are going to be the  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:00):**  biggest way to shape systems in the way that we want them to be.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:03):**  So backing up from that, how do you understand what the incentives are?  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:06):**  It's talking to people.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:07):**  I was talking to fishermen in my PhD, even though I was working with data and I was an  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:10):**  ecologist, it was talking to farmers and working at granular as the data scientists would be  
**[0:03:14-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:14):**  like, okay, what data?  
**[0:03:15-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:15):**  What data do you actually have to make your decisions on?  
**[0:03:16-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:16):**  And how do you weight that data yourself as a farmer?  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:18):**  And then how do you use that to make decisions?  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:20):**  That was what drew me to granular.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:21):**  And so from there have just been hunting for opportunities where you can provide incentives  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:27):**  for farmers that will help under underwrite their changes, which has sort of led me to  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:32):**  carbon, which is a wild bet, but one that I think is worth making.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:37):**  As you've been kind of in this world, both in fisheries and now in agriculture, how have  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:41):**  you been seeing the conversation around like sustainability broadly, and I guess, regen  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:45):**  or regeneration kind of change over the course of your career?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:49):**  I think it used to be, it was much more frosting than I feel like it is today where, oh, that's  
**[0:03:54-0:03:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:54):**  nice.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:55):**  It's off in the corner and we like to do a few press releases on that.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:03:57):**  And now it feels much more fundamental to the whole enterprise.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:00):**  Is this going to continue in its current frame for the next 10 years, the next 15 years?  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:04):**  Like we're often staring down in human career timelines, which I feel like a lot of us are  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:08):**  more sensitive to that, like in my career, while I work on this project, I could watch  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:12):**  the end of this wild caught fishery, like me personally, not my hypothetical kid.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:16):**  And I think that just does something to folks in terms of turning up the intensity of needing  
**[0:04:20-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:20):**  to find the solutions.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:21):**  I also think we've gone through a couple of waves around climate in terms of the importance  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:25):**  and like insane urgency that we are continuing to be bared down on that front.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:30):**  And that sort of went through a wave in 2008, 2009 that sort of fell apart with the, at  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:34):**  least in the U S with this failure of cap and trade to go all the way through.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:37):**  And then it's been really bottoming out and just coming right back up.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:39):**  And I think that's the other thing of all of this speaks to the entire system, right?  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:04:44):**  The entire system is what the problem is and we have to address the entire system to solve

**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:00):**  a lot of these systems.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:01):**  Was that part of the mission at granular and that kind of sustainability as core to how  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:06):**  you guys thought about what you were doing and how you thought about go to market incentive  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:10):**  design or was that sort of a by-product tell me a bit more about that journey.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:15):**  I think it depends on how you frame sustainability.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:17):**  A lot of times, like I said, people think of it as the separate thing.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:20):**  The focus at granular is about how do you drive value for farmers?  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:23):**  How do they make the most valuable, profitable decisions they can, and how do they like meld  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:26):**  all of those different data sources, whether it's your genetics of the hybrid that you're  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:30):**  planting or the crop that you're choosing or the way that you market it or the way that  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:33):**  you put down nitrogen, like how do you bring all of those things together as opposed to  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:36):**  just a focus on yields, which is also really true, actually in fisheries.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:39):**  Like you get the same coffee shop talk that I was hearing about in farming with fishermen.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:43):**  They'll come in, they'll go to the coffee shop and talk about their catch, but they  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:46):**  didn't talk about their gas, like how long they spent out there and how hard they fished.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:50):**  So anyway, that same sort of focus on aggregate yields only gets you so far.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:53):**  And so it's instead really on profit.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:55):**  And I think that's where sustainability is not called out explicitly in that, but to  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:05:59):**  the extent that sustainability is like a systemic part of how you make your business decisions  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:04):**  is because it adds value at some level to your operation.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:08):**  And so that focus on value actually, I think helped hone my strategic thinking on sustainability  
**[0:06:13-0:06:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:13):**  very quickly, because I put up lots of ideas of we could quantify butterfly habitat and  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:17):**  leadership was like, are they going to pay for our software because we have butterfly  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:20):**  habitat in it?  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:21):**  And I was like, oh yeah, there's no value.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:22):**  It might like for a small tail that really care about butterflies might drive value,  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:26):**  but not going to drive value for the majority of folks that are trying to improve their  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:30):**  businesses.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:31):**  And so if we make that link explicitly back to how that drives profit or value for the  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:35):**  farmer, we weren't going to get any adoption, which was a useful shortcut to not spend a  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:39):**  bunch of time and have a sandbox to do butterfly habitat and then try to bring it to market.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:42):**  So I was going to ask, was it surprising to you leaving academia company, this world thinking  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:47):**  about being out, I would say a mission oriented person and kind of thinking about the impact  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:50):**  side of things, what you learned about agriculture and how strong those incentives are?  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:54):**  What was that like for you?  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:56):**  It was a pretty rude awakening.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:06:58):**  I think as a scientist, I was like, I'm sure the gap here is science.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:02):**  As a scientist, I am uniquely suited to be the solution here.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:05):**  Not true.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:06):**  It wasn't a lack of data.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:07):**  Wasn't a lack of ability to quantify these impacts, which is what I emerged out of academia,  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:11):**  thinking that's my thesis.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:12):**  Like we just need to connect the pipes and I can send great science upwards and consumers  
**[0:07:16-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:16):**  will pay for it.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:17):**  And what's missing is like that sort of pipe connection, hence data science, hence that  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:20):**  sort of approach.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:21):**  Not true.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:22):**  The willing, the failure was willingness to pay.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:23):**  And that was the, that was a pretty rude awakening, I think for me, but a good one.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:26):**  Right.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:27):**  So a lot of us that are in academia at some points in our lives, like to figure out how  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:31):**  things work.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:32):**  And so that was like a, quite a shortcut to figuring out, Oh, that's what's going on here.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:35):**  And not get distracted by these other scientific uncertainties or blah, blah.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:39):**  It's just people don't want to write checks.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:41):**  So we got to figure out how they want to write checks.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:43):**  Other than proposing the butterfly habitat tool, any examples of how that kind of rude  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:48):**  awakening happened?  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:49):**  Was it through talking to farmers or proposing ideas internally?  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:52):**  How did that kind of manifest for you?  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:54):**  Coming from all directions, which was also reaffirming in terms of certainty I felt in,  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:58):**  in receiving this message.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:07:59):**  Some of it was farmers.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:00):**  So we have a huge spectrum of customers from folks that are doing fairly standard conventional  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:05):**  practices that are no cover crop sort of standard tillage standard corn, soy rotation approach.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:10):**  And then you have folks all the way in the other end of the spectrum that are doing five  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:12):**  to seven crop rotations that are doing multi-species cover crops, interseeding, experimenting with  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:18):**  all sorts of tillage, working on buffer habitat, like just doing all of the things.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:22):**  And I think what was true about that tale of farmers was either that they personally  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:28):**  cared quite a lot about those out and valued biodiversity, valued soil health, value that  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:33):**  stuff personally separate from what returns they were able to quantify on their balance  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:37):**  sheet and, or they had very unique market opportunities where they could sell to a whiskey  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:42):**  distillery or had ways to capture value out of that additional work that they were doing.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:47):**  So that was one observation, like several farms had that and it was like, Oh, that that's  
**[0:08:51-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:51):**  hard to replicate, right?  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:52):**  Like that you're in Colorado and have this particular hookup with this buyer.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:56):**  Like, how would I go to someone in Illinois and find that same opportunity for them?  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:08:59):**  Or how would they do that regardless of whether or not they need granular software to do that  
**[0:09:02-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:02):**  for them?  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:03):**  So that was one piece.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:04):**  And then it was also honestly when granular was a startup, before we joined part of Courteva,  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:07):**  trying to work with some of the bigger actors in ag in the supply chain and saying, look

**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:26):**  a field to market calculator.

**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:28):**  And they were like, nothing.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:29):**  So that was disappointing and frustrating to realize like there's tools out there that  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:32):**  are ready made to sort of quantify these impacts.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:34):**  And through trying to shop those around, honestly, was what sort of convinced me that I couldn't  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:38):**  also, I could be a terrible salesperson likely true, but it also felt like the thing I was  
**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:42):**  trying to sell was I think that no one was really willing to pay for.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:44):**  Emma was not in an official sales role at granular any more than anyone is in a sales  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:49):**  role when they work for a relatively small startup.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:52):**  But she learned a lot from the activity of selling her science to customers.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:09:56):**  When granular was acquired by what is now Corteva in 2018, and she migrated to the new

**[0:10:06-0:10:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:06):**  that early experience.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:07):**  Being an academic, it's one thing to jump out of academia into industry, I think.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:12):**  And there was one thing to jump into a startup.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:13):**  And then it's another thing to really be hoovered up into the belly of the beast in terms of  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:16):**  like real industry.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:17):**  Like those not, we're not messing around anymore.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:19):**  This is not like a fun startup idea.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:21):**  This is real.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:22):**  So that was definitely surprising and not any place that I would have expected myself  
**[0:10:25-0:10:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:25):**  to be.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:26):**  That said, I really loved it because it's entities like Corteva, like Syngenta, like  
**[0:10:31-0:10:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:31):**  Cargut.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:32):**  Like these are the ones where decisions get made that affect millions and millions of  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:35):**  acres.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:36):**  And so understanding what is prioritized, how it's prioritized, how you make decisions,  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:40):**  like how you drive business.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:41):**  And I think that same lesson that I learned at Granular, like it needs to drive value.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:45):**  And so understanding really what are the levers that can connect sustainability or regenerative  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:50):**  agriculture to business value is what I'm super interested to understand.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:53):**  To what extent can the private sector be an engine and a solution?  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:10:56):**  Because it's obvious that the private sector can move at a million miles an hour when it  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:00):**  needs to, when there's money on the table.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:03):**  And that's the world I think we live in right now that we need to move at about a million  
**[0:11:06-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:06):**  miles an hour to start solving some of those climate issues.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:08):**  And so can we start to put the pieces together of like, here's private industry that can  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:11):**  do that given the right incentives.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:14):**  What as a scientist, as someone who's got some technical background, can I start to  
**[0:11:17-0:11:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:17):**  get the shape of that question and look for those overlaps that might be missed?  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:19):**  And a lot of times I think people like me don't end up in places like Corteva.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:23):**  And so there's actually quite a large sandbox to play in of no one's looked at it from this  
**[0:11:26-0:11:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:26):**  angle before.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:27):**  Like I can go to town and put out some crazy ideas and some of them might stick, which  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:30):**  is how it got to carbon, which was this realization of I think ecosystem services as a framework  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:36):**  for folks that are in conservation biology or come from that background, it's going to  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:39):**  be a really familiar term, even though it's jargon to 99.9% of everyone else.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:44):**  But that framework of there are things that we value that come from natural systems.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:47):**  That always made a lot of sense to me as a way to think about how do we value nature?  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:51):**  How do we value natural systems?  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:54):**  And when it became clear that people were willing to start paying for carbon, that sort  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:57):**  of is what changed the game.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:11:59):**  Yes, we can measure it.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:00):**  Yes, we can quantify it.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:01):**  Then money and incentives have to be there.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:03):**  And that's what's been missing.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:04):**  And so as that started to shift was like, wow, we're dealing with a world in which farmers  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:09):**  can get value, not just for the practices, but the actual outcomes of what they're doing  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:13):**  on their field, which is an amazing angle for farmers to make choices about what makes  
**[0:12:18-0:12:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:18):**  sense for their operation.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:19):**  Cause we know the same practice everywhere is not appropriate.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:21):**  It also had a nice layer onto the digital strategy, which is it's requires a lot of  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:25):**  data.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:26):**  And so you need to be having doing digital record keeping in some form granular is one  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:29):**  approach to that.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:30):**  So there was an angle there on our own approach to value of data.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:33):**  And then there's this just huge revenue opportunity for farmers and folks that can help farmers  
**[0:12:38-0:12:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:38):**  access that revenue.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:39):**  And so all of a sudden now there's business value and we've got real environmental value.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:42):**  And this is clear that this is not an established market, but it's a bet worth taking because  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:46):**  it checks the boxes in a sort of structural way.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:50):**  That makes sense from how the business case has come together now and looking in hindsight  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:55):**  as it was coming together to do this work for you searching for other possible things  
**[0:12:59-0:13:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:12:59):**  and kind of the macro trends around carbon popped up.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:02):**  Like I know we've seen in the investment side, all the startup pitch decks shifted from AI  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:08):**  to blockchain to carbon.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:09):**  And so it feels like this kind of hype-y movement, but the way you articulate it is sounds like  
**[0:13:14-0:13:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:14):**  a pretty sound business case.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:15):**  Like how did it evolve?  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:17):**  I initially thought the supply chain was where to play.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:20):**  So we have consumers on one end that are a demonstrated source of demand for, you can  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:23):**  argue with how demonstrated, right?  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:24):**  There are all sorts of willingness to pay surveys, and then you actually look at market  
**[0:13:26-0:13:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:26):**  data and it tells you different stories, depending on how you slice it and which markets.

**[0:13:30-0:13:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:30):**  There's some uncertainty in willingness to pay.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:32):**  Anyway, you start there and you were backwards.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:33):**  And this is where I joined Granular from.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:36):**  Consumers simplistically want to pay for more natural, sustainable goods, however you define  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:40):**  that.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:41):**  I'm going to show up as a scientist and define that for them in a rigorous way that I feel  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:44):**  proud of as a scientist and has some rigor to it.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:47):**  And we'll just pass it through the supply chain and everyone will get a cut.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:50):**  Then I learned how complicated commodity supply chains were, right?  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:53):**  There's hen actors that all get cuts of this food after it leaves the farm gate, let alone  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:13:58):**  the farmer, which means that the value you have to pass through that supply chain has  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:03):**  to be monstrous in order for everyone to get a cut and there still would be something left  
**[0:14:06-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:06):**  for the consumer.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:07):**  I came to Granular also with this simplistic idea of like you change one acre of corn and  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:11):**  it scales to 180 million.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:12):**  Wow, that's so cool.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:14):**  Just one, whatever, you prove it out in one acre.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:16):**  And that's like super silly thinking.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:19):**  And yes, the cropping system is more simple than a diversified vegetable rotation, but  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:25):**  the complexity when it leaves the farm gate just blows your mind.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:28):**  So that was one realization of, okay, this can't go through the supply chain unless there's  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:32):**  a way more value associated with it than we see today.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:35):**  Okay.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:36):**  And that was both through talking to farmers, realizing that these very short supply chains  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:39):**  that were very simple could get that value passed all the way through.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:42):**  And then when we talked to some of the bigger supply chains, them being like the person  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:45):**  ahead of me is not going to pay for that and I'm not going to pay for that.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:47):**  And I just killed it right there.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:48):**  Then Emma stumbled on Nori, a carbon marketplace company that we've actually invested in at  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:53):**  Tenacious Ventures.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:54):**  Emma was intrigued by the fact that granular already had much of the data that Nori would  
**[0:14:59-0:15:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:14:59):**  need from farmers.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:00):**  And by the fact that Nori's strategy explicitly went outside the traditional supply chain,  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:05):**  meaning more value could make its way to farmers and consumers.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:09):**  This compounded by the opportunity to work at scale and the obvious business fit sealed  
**[0:15:13-0:15:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:13):**  the deal.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:14):**  But for Emma, buying into carbon also went deeper.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:18):**  Investment in regenerative ag is investment in place.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:21):**  It's not a thing that like skips and hops from Ohio to, I don't know, Ukraine and then  
**[0:15:25-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:25):**  back.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:26):**  It's a place that you like commit for years.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:28):**  And our commodity food system is built to skip around.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:31):**  And so that's also fundamentally structurally at odds with the kind of investment that you  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:34):**  need to drive change.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:36):**  And that was also a puzzle that like there's a few supply chains that did that.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:39):**  I think Denone had its like preferred supplier model that was closed to more entrance.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:44):**  It's so good that it like literally couldn't scale, would not scale because they had their  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:48):**  participants and it was working for the participants, but it wasn't working for all the other farmers.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:52):**  So that's why carbon just was like, oh, this, if this works, this addresses structurally  
**[0:15:56-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:56):**  so many of the limitations we've seen previously.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:15:58):**  So that sort of like formative realization of like the pieces are here now that they  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:02):**  weren't previously and the ability to trial this out on a pretty small scale with a small  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:06):**  startup with a handful of farmers to really understand the value that they would get was  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:10):**  really what unlocked the opportunity to go big and get into the space.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:13):**  So it wasn't quite as hypey as I think sometimes the funding market makes it seem like.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:18):**  What was the response initially when you started socializing this internally?  
**[0:16:21-0:16:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:21):**  Was it easy to align to organizational motivations?  
**[0:16:24-0:16:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:24):**  Was there skepticism?  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:26):**  Definite skepticism for sure.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:28):**  I think I was lucky enough that I had been thoughtful enough in my approaches previously  
**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:34):**  that they essentially said, here's the rope for you to go hang yourself.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:37):**  This is yours.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:38):**  If you want to go for it, you can and like good luck.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:40):**  And I was like, yeah, I do.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:41):**  This is too good of an opportunity in terms of the ways that it fits in to the way I've  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:45):**  been thinking about this to not go after this and it seems like a risk worth taking.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:48):**  So I really appreciated the independence and freedom I had to prove that out.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:52):**  And I feel very lucky that we had really dedicated customers to be teachers there and to be like  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:58):**  sanity checkers.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:16:59):**  And so that sort of long-term relationship with customers was so critical to have that  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:03):**  feedback loop so early that I could also get that sense too, that I wasn't completely off  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:08):**  the deep end and was going to show up on a farm's porch and say, what do you think?  
**[0:17:11-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:11):**  And then be like, this is super dumb.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:13):**  Don't talk to me about this.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:14):**  Like, did you have any ideas for anyone else was like, that is a horrible idea.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:18):**  Don't do it.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:19):**  Like I need that come to mind where you got that feedback and change your mind.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:21):**  I don't think I did butterflies, but I feel like it was something like that.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:24):**  I think edge habitat is really hard where there's a lot of value to it from water quality  
**[0:17:28-0:17:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:28):**  and pollination services and habitat connectivity.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:30):**  But you're also asking farms to grow a lot of potential weeds next door.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:35):**  Like you're literally asking them to farm weeds or what you act as weeds in their fields  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:38):**  and don't act as weeds outside of their fields.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:41):**  And that was like, Oh yeah.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:42):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:43):**  That's what I'm asking.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:44):**  That's not very thoughtful is it?  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:45):**  So getting feedback early on was pretty helpful for thinking through how would you actually

**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:51):**  When did things start to gain momentum or have they imagined they have internally where  
**[0:17:55-0:17:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:55):**  they're aha moments for others at Corteva going, Oh, this is really starting to make  
**[0:17:58-0:17:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:58):**  sense.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:17:59):**  Or how have you seen the change internally in people's mindsets and actions?  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:04):**  A couple of unlocks for us.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:05):**  One was just sort of again, addressing the scale, right?  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:09):**  Agriculture is huge, like in the U S and the U S market, right?  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:12):**  It's just millions and millions of acres.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:13):**  And when you start to be able to provide a solution that can scale the economics work  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:17):**  really well.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:18):**  So that was one big aha.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:19):**  The other big aha honestly, it was just this explosion of interest in around soil carbon.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:23):**  I think it was really lucky that I had started with Norian 2018 and then were able to credibly  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:27):**  put together a larger business case to say, you hear a lot of buzz about this.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:31):**  This is how it would actually work if we applied it to a business.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:33):**  So that was really lucky.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:35):**  And then honestly, some really healthy competition in the market was very helpful to say, we  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:39):**  got folks knocking on our door with our customers, trying to tempt them away by carbon programs.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:43):**  What's our answer?  
**[0:18:44-0:18:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:44):**  And we were able to step up and say, here's an answer.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:47):**  We thought through it.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:48):**  We've done some homework, we've tried it out and this can be a good response.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:50):**  And so I think those things combined really set the stage.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:52):**  Didn't guarantee that, that we would get alignment, but really helped us drive alignment.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:56):**  But of those things, you know, people willing to write checks.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:18:59):**  We talk a lot about water quality or biodiversity credits and ecosystem markets overall.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:04):**  And I am, I'm an ecologist.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:06):**  I would love to work on a biodiversity project.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:08):**  I cannot find people that are really willing to put down durable dollars for that.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:12):**  And so because we had that for carbon, because we had that for climate change, we can now  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:16):**  build a market for that.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:18):**  That changes the whole scale of the probability of success for these things is that willingness  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:22):**  to pay.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:23):**  And tell me, there's a lot in this kind of ecosystem services space that gets lumped  
**[0:19:26-0:19:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:26):**  together.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:27):**  It's like carbon, it's biodiversity, it's water.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:29):**  So I guess give me your definition, like, what are you guys talking about in this program  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:33):**  and how I guess is Corteva doing it?  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:35):**  Walk me through what you guys actually do.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:37):**  And then we can talk a little bit about how that compares to the competition.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:40):**  So what we are doing is focusing on crediting farmers for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions  
**[0:19:44-0:19:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:44):**  or carbon sequestered in their soils.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:46):**  So that's the environmental outcome that farms get checks on is what are the outcomes of  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:49):**  their practices on that front?  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:51):**  So it does not explicitly include any valuation for biodiversity.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:54):**  It does not explicitly include any valuation for water quality, despite those being really  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:19:59):**  well-proven statistically sound co-benefits, right?  
**[0:20:03-0:20:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:03):**  Those come out of these practices that also happen to be carbon, which is part of the  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:06):**  wonderful story of investing in nature-based systems period.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:10):**  So just on carbon, what our program is focused on row crops, predominantly in the Midwest,  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:15):**  but stretches out across everywhere you see row crop farming, we're able to offer a program.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:20):**  And it's really the practices that qualify are adopting cover crop, reducing or eliminating  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:26):**  tillage or addressing nitrogen management.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:28):**  And those have to be new practices.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:30):**  Often if you get into the depths of carbon markets, right, additionality is a thing.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:34):**  So because we are not buying these credits ourselves, we are helping these credits go  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:38):**  to offset markets and scope three markets.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:40):**  We have to abide by what those buyers want.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:43):**  This is like willingness to pay.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:44):**  And those buyers want to pay for additional quote, new carbon.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:47):**  Talk about how this doesn't serve early adopters and how unfair that is.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:50):**  It doesn't serve early adopters and it is unfair.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:53):**  This is not a silver bullet solution.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:55):**  And it's got a different soapbox about silver bullets, but it's not a silver bullet.  
**[0:20:58-0:20:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:58):**  It's not the only thing that we need to do.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:20:59):**  It's not the only thing that will work.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:01):**  The way it works is this is a Corteva carbon program.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:04):**  So typically farms work with their existing advisors on the farm.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:07):**  So often a pioneer seed rep or a pioneer agronomist, but anyone, regardless of their customer status  
**[0:21:11-0:21:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:11):**  to Corteva can participate.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:12):**  Really we see this as an accelerant to practice change, right?  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:16):**  So these are folks that are often thinking about this.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:18):**  I'm a should I do it this year or next year?  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:20):**  Should I do 50 acres or a hundred acres?  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:22):**  This is a program that helps you risk those choices and say, do it this year.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:25):**  There's money on the line here.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:26):**  Do it on a hundred acres, not 50 acres.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:28):**  So it really accelerates adoption trends.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:30):**  We work with Indigo on the backend as an MRV.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:32):**  So the other thing that we took from the get go, which was really informed by our work  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:36):**  with Nori is we can't nor do we want to do it all.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:39):**  We don't want to own the space.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:40):**  We want to partner with others and do what we're best at.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:42):**  And what we're best at is two things.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:44):**  One, we already work with millions of acres of farmers, with the farmland and with farmers  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:48):**  to make decisions on those farm acres.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:51):**  And this is just one more decision, right?  
**[0:21:52-0:21:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:52):**  One more tool, one more piece of conversation for the right farmer.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:54):**  And this just helps us get to more farms.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:56):**  So that's one thing.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:21:57):**  And then the second thing is that we can bring to bear more innovative solutions, whether  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:01):**  it's nitrogen stabilizers or biologicals or things like that, but the market has to be  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:05):**  there to begin with.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:06):**  So those are the two places that we want to focus on in this carbon space.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:08):**  We also really firmly wanted to stay on the side of the farmer.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:11):**  We don't want to be on both sides of the market where we're both trying to get the most money  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:15):**  for a farmer and trying to get the most money for the credit and trying to eat up in between.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:18):**  And that was the other part of taking that partnership approach.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:20):**  So we work with Indigo and ESMC as what we call MRVs, so the quantifiers.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:24):**  So all of these startups that are popping up and pitching, many of them are MRVs, did  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:27):**  not want to play in that space because of the amount of venture capital that was going  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:31):**  into that space and a couple of other reasons.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:32):**  It's a hard space to be in.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:34):**  And in particular, we wanted to be honest about the conflict of interest.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:37):**  So if we are involved with putting our thumb on the scale for how much carbon is being  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:41):**  quantified on that soil and we get paid based on how much carbon is quantified in that soil,  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:45):**  it's not a good place to be given that these are non-physical commodities that you need  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:49):**  to trust really in the rigor of the carbon credit that's being generated in order to  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:53):**  charge that highest premium.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:54):**  So we wanted to completely structurally stay out of that and really be clear that our role  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:22:58):**  is with the farm and work with partners that we thought could bring really high quality,  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:01):**  rigorous quantification to the market.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:04):**  But also honestly our strength is not in selling carbon credits.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:06):**  Like we don't have that network.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:07):**  We don't have those skills and we didn't really want to be in that market anyway.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:09):**  So we really wanted to sit on that side of the farmer and support on this agronomic decisions  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:12):**  and decisions whether or not to participate at all.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:15):**  How has that changed these advisors and these sales reps like boots on the ground behavior?  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:19):**  Are they thinking differently about things that they recommend or how they sell products?  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:25):**  What's changing at the end of the supply chain?  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:27):**  I think I'm already seeing an increased demand and desire to learn more about carbon, right?  
**[0:23:33-0:23:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:33):**  So originally people are interested in soil health or they're interested in yield impacts,  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:36):**  but now there's money in caring about how much soil carbon sequestration.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:40):**  So you see a lot of really sophisticated interest from agronomists and farmers themselves saying,  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:44):**  okay, how does decomposition rates vary as a function of soil mixture and disturbance?  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:49):**  Like sort of levels of stuff that as a scientist, I'm super excited to go deep on, but was not  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:52):**  holding my breath that everyone would be that interested in those dimensions, but a ton  
**[0:23:56-0:23:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:56):**  of demand for more knowledge from our channels.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:23:58):**  The other thing that's pretty cool to start seeing click into place, and this sort of  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:01):**  goes back to my harping on incentives is someone who personally is really excited about sustainability  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:05):**  and passionate about that space.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:07):**  I can run around a company all day and be like, well, marketing team could do this and  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:10):**  whatever could do that.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:11):**  And all of a sudden those connections were happening organically without me needing to  
**[0:24:14-0:24:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:14):**  be in the middle.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:15):**  So our marketing team now is like, well, we need to help farms meet that educational need  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:19):**  and start to put together and pull together NRCS and extensions work and other NGOs work  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:23):**  on soil health and regenerative ag.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:27):**  And that was not because there's a passion project from one person in a company to do  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:30):**  that, which we had have several of those folks in Corteva.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:33):**  There's lots of people passionate about this space, but no business reason to do that.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:36):**  And it's always swimming upstream, right?  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:38):**  If it's a passion project and it's not a business decision.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:40):**  And all of a sudden it's a business decision of how do we help farms adopt, not just reduced  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:44):**  till, but also cover crop because we get more carbon per acre.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:47):**  And all of a sudden Corteva makes more money because we get less than 25% of that credit.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:51):**  Most of it goes to the farm, but we get part of that credit.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:54):**  And so we want to maximize those credits too.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:24:56):**  So it's just all of a sudden, like that stuff started clicking into place of now we start  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:01):**  to have impact and business returns at the same time, which that's the dream, right?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:04):**  When you talk about impact and you talk about like private sector being a force for good,  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:08):**  and that just started to happen.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:09):**  So all of those things started falling into place in a way that you're like, okay, I could  
**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:12):**  see the path for how businesses then start to scale and be part of the solution.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:16):**  If pricing rules are set, right?  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:18):**  What are the weak points of the work right now?  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:20):**  What are the challenges?  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:21):**  Is it reliable data or be a farmer resistance or adoption, or what are some of the challenges?  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:26):**  One to be really candid about is that the price of carbon is not high enough to drive  
**[0:25:30-0:25:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:30):**  the scale of change that we need to see.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:32):**  So for a farmland to be a climate solution, we need to be on millions and millions of  
**[0:25:36-0:25:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:36):**  acres, 20, 50, 100 million acres.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:38):**  This is not a 10,000 acre game.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:40):**  So right now the price of carbon, we're seeing anywhere from 15 to $40 a ton, depending on  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:45):**  which buyer it's which time in the market, that's already a lot higher than it was.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:48):**  Like I think we're starting at 15 and now we're really seeing 40 should pop up a lot  
**[0:25:52-0:25:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:52):**  more.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:53):**  So that's even in the span of less than 12 months, quite an aggressive rise.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:25:56):**  But that said, it still doesn't fully offset the costs of adopting these practices, which  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:26:00):**  is worth being candid about.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:26:02):**  And until we see the price of carbon offset the full amount of adopting cover crop, paying  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:26:07):**  for cover crop seed, doing that seeding pass and termination pass, it's going to be a slow  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:26:11):**  climb.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:26:12):**  And you're going to accelerate the existing adoption trends, but you're not going to move  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:26:14):**  it at the scale that you need to on the timeframe that you need to address climate change.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:26:18):**  That's one thing to call out that you just need to see a higher price of carbon.

**[0:26:24-0:26:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:26:24):**  and to be ready for that upside.

**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:26:33):**  And so the way we handle that as defaulting to transparency, we went with Indigo in part  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:26:37):**  because they use the, this is jargon, the climate action reserves, soil enrichment

**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:26:50):**  model is.

**[0:27:17-0:27:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:27:17):**  solution to climate change by that lack of standardization.

**[0:27:36-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:27:36):**  and in supply chains.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:27:37):**  It's really hard to understand exactly who is responsible to pay for what in a supply  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:27:41):**  chain.

**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:27:44):**  And so we're waiting for some of these big guidance docs to come through this summer.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:27:48):**  And it's like three months, six months, and when your goalpost is 2030, every three months  
**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:27:52):**  really matters.

**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:27:54):**  Knowing that it's going to take another year to set up a business and work out the kinks.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:27:57):**  So that's also been hard to understand exactly scope three of the engines and levers we can  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:00):**  play.

**[0:28:04-0:28:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:04):**  are currently set up?

**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:07):**  And we've got to throw a bunch of darts at the wall to figure out what's going to stick.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:11):**  What's your overall view on how they're currently set up?  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:13):**  I think there's a lot of things that I obviously like about carbon markets, right?  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:17):**  This ability to divorce impact on the ground from supply chains, I think is a really helpful

**[0:28:27-0:28:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:27):**  you have between investment in a place and ability to literally hop around as a buyer  
**[0:28:30-0:28:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:30):**  and go everywhere you want.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:32):**  If we want change to happen at scale in agriculture in the next five years, I don't think we're  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:37):**  going to rewrite our commodity system.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:39):**  And so how do we make change inside that existing commodity system?  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:43):**  Acknowledging there are limitations.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:44):**  This is not to excuse lack of progress in other dimensions, but I think that's just  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:49):**  an acknowledgement that's worth having.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:50):**  This is an engine that can unlock change in our current system today, which is what we  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:54):**  need to do along with rethinking where we go in the next 15 to 30 years.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:57):**  So I think that's working really well.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:28:58):**  I also think what's working really well is focus on outcomes.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:02):**  Outcomes just again, snap this incentives into place.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:04):**  If you say that cover crops is what you need to do everywhere, right?  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:07):**  And you get paid per acre.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:09):**  Cover crops, it's very hard to do cover crops in the Northern Plains.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:12):**  It's very hard to put in and get germination after you harvest corn when it gets so cold  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:16):**  so fast and you have to do interseeding, which adds a whole new set of barriers for practices.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:20):**  So instead of saying tillage is what's appropriate here, but what's appropriate is like sequestering  
**[0:29:24-0:29:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:24):**  carbon and you can choose however you want to get there, whatever makes sense for your  
**[0:29:27-0:29:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:27):**  farm and hang on those outcomes is what we actually care about.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:30):**  When we all stop and think about it, I don't think all of us really care that much about  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:33):**  cover crops.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:34):**  We care about what the cover crops do to the soil, what it does to nutrient availability  
**[0:29:37-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:37):**  and what it does to carbon sequestration.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:39):**  So let's give farmers who know their businesses best the independence and flexibility to make  
**[0:29:43-0:29:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:43):**  those choices.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:44):**  So I love those things about it.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:45):**  I think some of the things that are frustrating about the space focus on silver bullets or  
**[0:29:49-0:29:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:49):**  either or conversations.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:50):**  So one, somehow a carbon market is going to solve all the things like including equity,  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:57):**  right?  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:29:58):**  Of big farms, small farms, underserved farms, like it's not designed to do that.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:00):**  Those are important issues, but to try to make one policy or market solution solve all  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:05):**  the issues, sets it up for failure and undercuts what progress it can make against important  
**[0:30:10-0:30:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:10):**  goals.

**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:13):**  solutions period of which soil carbon fits into that, which there was an article in the  
**[0:30:17-0:30:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:17):**  New York Times, how trees are not going to solve all the problems.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:20):**  And I got pretty frustrated reading that article, but then realized, okay, the audience here  
**[0:30:24-0:30:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:24):**  is probably not me who's trying to do a nature-based solution.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:27):**  Instead it's corporations that are thinking, oh, let's put this off and buy a couple of

**[0:30:33-0:30:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:33):**  And I think that was pitched out, but the way that it was like editorialized in the  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:36):**  New York Times was like news break, trees are going to not do anything, which I think  
**[0:30:41-0:30:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:41):**  sets us back a lot in this conversation.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:43):**  And I think we should be thoughtful about how we do that, which is to say, if we are  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:46):**  in a world where it's either nature-based solutions or it's engineered solutions, we're  
**[0:30:51-0:30:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:51):**  screwed.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:52):**  We're totally screwed.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:53):**  Like that end of story.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:55):**  If we're in that like either or world, no solution is happening.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:30:58):**  We need all the tools at all the scales all the time to make a change, which is why climate  
**[0:31:03-0:31:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:03):**  change is so daunting and so scary.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:05):**  And so I think that's a frustrating thing in the conversation where people are like,  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:08):**  it's not exactly the same as engineered.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:10):**  No, but it's available today at scale today.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:12):**  And your engineered solutions are going to be available at scale maybe in five years.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:16):**  So let's do this now and keep working on that.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:18):**  And that's the solution.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:19):**  So I think those are some of the things that are frustrating about it.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:21):**  How do you think about the challenge of farms themselves not being carbon neutral?  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:27):**  Like they have a footprint that they have through whatever use of diesel, fertilizer,  
**[0:31:32-0:31:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:32):**  et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:33):**  And then they're selling these offsets to other industries.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:36):**  Does that pose a challenge to you at all?  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:39):**  The way that I've been thinking about it is to stay within one and a half degrees of warming.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:44):**  The sort of standard approach there is to say we have to be net zero by 2050, which  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:48):**  is not to say that we're emitting no CO2, no greenhouse gases.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:51):**  It's just that whatever we're emitting is being sequestered out of the atmosphere.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:54):**  So net, we're not adding anything new and then we go down from there.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:31:57):**  So you can tune at a macro scale, lots of industries up and down.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:00):**  You can say, okay, industrial concrete is going to go down and electrical vehicles is  
**[0:32:04-0:32:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:04):**  going to be great.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:05):**  And you can turn all those and make all the assumptions.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:07):**  Almost every single set of pathways of what those are called for those of us that are  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:10):**  not steeped in that all every day, most of them have emissions and ag as a global industry,  
**[0:32:15-0:32:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:15):**  right?  
**[0:32:16-0:32:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:16):**  We're not saying that ag is going to go down to zero emissions with this because of this  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:20):**  acknowledgement that right now it takes fossil fuels to run equipment.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:25):**  There is like emissions from livestock.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:28):**  There's emissions from rice.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:29):**  There's emissions from N2O directly off of fields where nitrogen is applied.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:32):**  Like all of those things are a reality and tuning down food production is not what we're  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:36):**  trying to do for the most part, right?  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:38):**  That's not really a viable pathway to say, well, just produce half as many calories and  
**[0:32:41-0:32:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:41):**  that will be fine.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:42):**  The fact that farms themselves are not carbon neutral is not inherently flawed.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:46):**  What's important is that you can accurately measure their baseline and show that baseline  
**[0:32:50-0:32:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:50):**  is changing because that's what's going to drive the change.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:53):**  And these macro things, it's really hard to say, are they doing enough?  
**[0:32:55-0:32:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:55):**  Are they cutting enough?  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:56):**  But again, I let the price signals drive that of if these emissions are valuable enough  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:32:59):**  to cut, they will become more valued as a thing and farms can make their own decisions  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:03):**  of whether or not it makes sense for them to tune their grain drying to use less diesel  
**[0:33:06-0:33:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:06):**  fuel on their grain dryer because it pays them to do so.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:09):**  And that's the way to get at this and not try to say everyone has to be zero and then  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:13):**  you can go down from there because you like put additional barriers in front of change  
**[0:33:18-0:33:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:18):**  that can happen in the system if you do that.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:21):**  As you think about the future of this space and of your work, do you think that like the  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:24):**  carbon ecosystem services work could cannibalize some of Corteva's other products or cause  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:29):**  broader shifts in the organization?  
**[0:33:32-0:33:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:32):**  How do you see that changing?  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:33):**  Yeah, I think this is an investment in market formation that adds value to a bunch of Corteva's  
**[0:33:38-0:33:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:38):**  CP and like other sustainable tools.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:40):**  So nitrogen stabilizers are a good example.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:43):**  They're on the market today, not because of their end to own impact, but because of their  
**[0:33:46-0:33:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:46):**  ability to cut synthetic nitrogen needs and save farmers money.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:49):**  That said, there's also a very credible story to be told about how it reduces end to own  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:53):**  emissions.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:54):**  And today that value doesn't get priced into stabilizers for Corteva.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:33:57):**  And so I think by developing these markets that are going to pay for climate impacts  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:00):**  means that it opens up a whole nother dimension for Corteva to start investing in and input  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:04):**  companies more generally to start being the engine to develop tools that address not only  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:08):**  the agronomic needs on the field, but also climate, like starts to capture some of that  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:11):**  climate benefit that soils and farmland has.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:14):**  And so this investment for Corteva in developing our carbon program and continuing to see strengthening  
**[0:34:18-0:34:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:18):**  of carbon markets more generally provides another market for Corteva itself to sell  
**[0:34:21-0:34:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:21):**  into.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:22):**  We started the conversation with kind of consumer preferences being a driver here and then talking  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:28):**  about how maybe they're not so much of a driver for sustainability given all the challenges  
**[0:34:32-0:34:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:32):**  we've talked about.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:33):**  Do you see like better quantification of nutritional outcomes if we kind of zoom out and look forward  
**[0:34:38-0:34:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:38):**  as a lever?  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:39):**  And do you think that would change the potential pull through from consumers and help us overcome  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:43):**  this challenge of supply chain complexity?  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:46):**  Definitely I see nutrition and convenience is actually the two biggest drivers in consumer  
**[0:34:51-0:34:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:51):**  preferences and sustainability is a fast follow.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:53):**  So if you have a nutrition angle and there's a sustainability angle, like you're doing  
**[0:34:57-0:34:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:57):**  great.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:34:58):**  So some of this regenerative farming, especially on milk and trace minerals and stuff in milk

**[0:35:06-0:35:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:06):**  health there.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:07):**  I think that's really interesting.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:08):**  Also some recent work about bioavailability and produce, right?  
**[0:35:12-0:35:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:12):**  And often it decays really fast.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:14):**  So you have to have very fresh produce to see these signals in.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:16):**  But if you get that very fresh produce that is in regeneratively farmed soils that are  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:19):**  much more healthy, you start to see X, Y, and Z nutrition.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:22):**  I think we're really hitching ourselves to a rocket when those things start to come.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:26):**  The personalized nutrition work, which I think has lost some cache recently as I don't know,  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:30):**  we're thinking about blockchain and whatever else we're thinking about these days.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:33):**  But if that breaks through and we start to discover those links, I think that's huge.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:37):**  Convenience is the other side.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:38):**  So far I've been disappointed that sustainability, but also feeling more pragmatic about it,  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:42):**  but that so far has not been the driver that we need to see to have that kind of change  
**[0:35:46-0:35:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:46):**  in the supply chain for commodities.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:48):**  Emma's experience coming into the ag carbon space really resonated with me and her story  
**[0:35:53-0:35:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:53):**  offers some useful insights for those looking to wade into the space themselves.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:35:58):**  First I think Emma's view about the gap being in the willingness to pay and not the presence  
**[0:36:02-0:36:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:02):**  or quality of the science is super critical.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:05):**  We talked to a lot of people, academics, startups, and even industry scientists who are still  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:10):**  firmly in the camp where Emma started, but obsessive focus on the science or tech while  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:15):**  ignoring the wants and needs of the people who will actually use it is its own problem,  
**[0:36:20-0:36:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:20):**  not a solution.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:21):**  The two insights that Emma pointed to in explaining why they went the route of partnership versus  
**[0:36:26-0:36:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:26):**  alternatives are also critical because of the length and complexity of traditional supply  
**[0:36:30-0:36:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:30):**  chains and the extraordinary challenge of scale, particularly in US markets, Emma believed  
**[0:36:35-0:36:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:35):**  it didn't make sense to tackle the building of a whole carbon system.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:40):**  Instead she teamed up with Nori and later Indigo Ag and was able to leverage partnerships  
**[0:36:44-0:36:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:44):**  to follow a different path.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:46):**  This makes sense on both sides as supply chain partners will inevitably have a lower cost  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:50):**  of customer acquisition given they're already talking to farmers.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:54):**  Finally what Emma said about positioning Corteva on the side of the farmer is really important.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:36:59):**  I so appreciated her recognition and candid comments around the fact that when a company  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:37:03):**  is both responsible for measuring an intangible commodity and for selling it, this creates  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:37:08):**  a serious conflict of interest that undermines confidence, not just of consumers, but also  
**[0:37:13-0:37:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:37:13):**  customers.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:37:14):**  I think this is a consideration that many in the carbon space are taking too lightly,  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:37:18):**  which creates risks that confidence in the whole ag carbon sector could erode over time.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:37:23):**  We'll be watching closely as more companies enter the space and as consolidation and exits  
**[0:37:27-0:37:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:37:27):**  impact these conflicts of interest over time.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/14/designing-agriculture-carbon-markets-emma-fuller#t=0:37:30):**  For now, that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.

### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 18:31:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:00:12):**  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:00:17):**  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:00:22):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:00:27):**  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  
**[0:00:31-0:00:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:00:31):**  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Before I tell you about today's guest, I want  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:00:43):**  to share something we've been working on for the past few weeks. You might remember that  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:00:47):**  we partnered up with Decipher to bring you four episodes on getting ag tech ready. While  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:00:52):**  we've teased out the insights and examples from those four episodes and created a free  
**[0:00:57-0:01:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:00:57):**  ebook with five practical tips to help you or farmers you know, because hopefully you'll  
**[0:01:03-0:01:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:01:03):**  share it, to get ag tech ready. You can find the ebook on our website or in the show notes.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:01:10):**  So today's guest is Victor Friedberg, an entrepreneur and investor who shares his systems approach  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:01:16):**  to investing, lessons from successes in his portfolio like Beyond Meat, and opportunities  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:01:22):**  for farmers to benefit from the trends that he's seeing in the food system. Victor started  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:01:28):**  as an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, where he built one of the first social networks  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:01:32):**  in the mid 90s, including raising money from Motorola ventures and a few other Silicon  
**[0:01:37-0:01:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:01:37):**  Valley VC firms. More recently, Victor co founded S2G Ventures, a VC firm based in Chicago,  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:01:45):**  LA. We kick off our conversation with the story behind how Victor became interested  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:01:50):**  in food and ag in the first place.  
**[0:01:52-0:02:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:01:52):**  Going back to 2008-2009, I was really starting to think about systems from the investment  
**[0:02:00-0:02:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:02:00):**  standpoint, but mostly is it related to energy systems and water systems and specifically  
**[0:02:07-0:02:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:02:07):**  as it applied to things like off-grid micro for rural India or low-cost D-South for sub-Saharan  
**[0:02:17-0:02:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:02:17):**  Africa, so really a global development perspective. And I had started a platform for investment  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:02:24):**  called Launch, which was funded by NASA, State Department, USA, Nike, and a bunch of other  
**[0:02:30-0:02:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:02:30):**  corporations to tackle these big global development issues. And at the beginning of those investments,  
**[0:02:37-0:02:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:02:37):**  we were really investing in singular companies. And I just started to think more about how  
**[0:02:44-0:02:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:02:44):**  those systems at a macro level were acting. What were their leverage points? Who were  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:02:52):**  the stakeholders? Where could capital and innovation start moving the system into just  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:02:59):**  being better? And I did a rare thing. I took a vacation at that time, which was an unusual  
**[0:03:05-0:03:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:03:05):**  thing to do. And I went to Spain and I was there with my girlfriend at the time. And  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:03:14):**  I was in Valencia and went to the central market in Valencia, Spain. And it's this beautiful  
**[0:03:21-0:03:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:03:21):**  turn of the century Art Nouveau kind of building and all these different stalls with every  
**[0:03:28-0:03:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:03:28):**  vendor and farmer, each with their own little specialty. And I went walking up to this one  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:03:36):**  farm and vendor who was selling peaches and all they were selling was peaches. And I could  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:03:41):**  smell the peach from almost 10 feet away. And when I bought the peach from Pablo and  
**[0:03:47-0:03:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:03:47):**  I just tasted it, it was like an epiphany. I had just never tasted a peach like that.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:03:55):**  And it made me realize that the peaches I had been eating all my life were just shadows  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:04:00):**  of the real thing. And here I was, I was a person of means. I could shop at Whole Foods  
**[0:04:06-0:04:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:04:06):**  or go to a fancy restaurant. But here at the central market in Valencia, an entire community  
**[0:04:14-0:04:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:04:14):**  from wealthy to working class were having a singular food experience that was superior  
**[0:04:22-0:04:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:04:22):**  to mine. And I just wondered why. And so that made me just take a step back and come to  
**[0:04:30-0:04:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:04:30):**  the realization which seems self-evident now, which was food was a system. And as I looked  
**[0:04:38-0:04:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:04:38):**  deeper and deeper into that, I had the insight that that system was going to change dramatically  
**[0:04:45-0:04:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:04:45):**  over the next 10 years. And from that co-founded S2G Ventures, which is a venture fund in the  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:04:53):**  United States to really put that soil to shelf systems investing pieces to work.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:04:59):**  My personal journey into food and ag also came about through a vacation to a Spanish  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:05:04):**  speaking country. So we have that in common, which I imagine not a ton of people do.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:05:08):**  That's great. What's your story?  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:05:11):**  I went to South America on holiday and ended up staying for almost a year and living on  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:05:18):**  a number of different farms. And my moment, like your peach moment was a tomato moment.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:05:23):**  So I was living on an organic farm and pulling weeds from the tomatoes. And I grew up in  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:05:30):**  California where there was a lot of conversation around organic as the answer to all of our  
**[0:05:35-0:05:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:05:35):**  problems and pulling weeds in the hot, sweaty, organic tomato farm really made me think about  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:05:42):**  whether organic made a lot of sense at scale and how technology could be used to do a lot  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:05:47):**  of these tasks that were being done manually in a way that was both sustainable and efficient  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:05:53):**  and kind of breaking that trade off.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:05:55):**  Well that's a great story. And I think for your listeners, I think the main is there  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:05:59):**  that everybody should be taking more vacations and preferably to a Spanish speaking country.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:06:06):**  My story reminded Victor of a time when he was sitting right between the past and future  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:06:12):**  of technology in agriculture.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:06:14):**  So early in S2G, we were, you know, we had identified that sort of weeding was a big  
**[0:06:22-0:06:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:06:22):**  obstacle in regards to conversion of conventional to organic and that if you could solve that  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:06:29):**  problem, you could begin onboarding a lot of acreage and bring more organic fruits and  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:06:36):**  vegetables and grains to market.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:06:39):**  So we were looking at a company that was spin out of Carnegie Mellon University, which is  
**[0:06:44-0:06:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:06:44):**  a very globally respected and renowned robotics university. And so there was a spin out that  
**[0:06:52-0:07:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:06:52):**  came out of there and I think the company's name was Robot. And the idea was to create  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:07:01):**  a autonomous weeder for row crops.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:07:06):**  And so we were really starting to have a lot of meetings and as we were diligently seeing  
**[0:07:11-0:07:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:07:11):**  it, we thought it would be good to have it at one of these Midwest farm fairs where all  
**[0:07:19-0:07:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:07:19):**  the farmers in the area come and look at different combines and different tools of the trade.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:07:26):**  So we had sort of Robot come to that fair and there's a picture I took from that farm  
**[0:07:35-0:07:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:07:35):**  day, which it was this autonomous robot, which was a version one, pretty clunky looking.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:07:42):**  It had the visualization tower, it had a bunch of wheels and it was carrying a little train  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:07:49):**  trailer behind it. But you could see sort of the vision for what they wanted to do.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:07:55):**  And there were all of these Amish and Mennonite farmers who were all in traditional gear and  
**[0:08:04-0:08:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:08:04):**  wearing their trousers and suspenders and the hats and the pipes. And they've been farming  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:08:11):**  the way they've been farming for a very long time and probably for good reason, somewhat  
**[0:08:15-0:08:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:08:15):**  skeptical of technology. But it's this picture of about 14 Amish and Mennonite farmers looking  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:08:25):**  at this autonomous weeder. And I just love that photograph.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:08:29):**  Fortunately, Victor still has this photograph, which we've included in the blog and show  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:08:33):**  notes for this episode. One of the things that Victor is known for is taking an ecosystem  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:08:38):**  approach, looking at agriculture as a system and getting the right people around the table  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:08:44):**  for a particular opportunity. People like investors, manufacturers, policymakers, or  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:08:50):**  farmers who can really help that company to succeed. When S2G set out to raise their first  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:08:55):**  fund in 2013, no one was really taking this kind of approach to venture capital and food  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:09:00):**  and ag. There are lots of venture capital funds doing  
**[0:09:04-0:09:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:09:04):**  food and agriculture, but nobody was thinking about it holistically. And so you had late  
**[0:09:11-0:09:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:09:11):**  stage CPG oriented growth funds. You had purely ag domain funds. You had the start of the  
**[0:09:22-0:09:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:09:22):**  Silicon Valley funds getting early into food, but they were looking at it a very different  
**[0:09:30-0:09:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:09:30):**  way. They were looking at food as just another sector ready to be disrupted, which was an  
**[0:09:37-0:09:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:09:37):**  interesting frame. And so the idea of doing the first soil to shelf systems fund and the  
**[0:09:49-0:09:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:09:49):**  approach we were taking to do that, which was really to reject the Silicon Valley model.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:09:57):**  And I think there was some, I think there was some belief that, and some credibility  
**[0:10:03-0:10:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:10:03):**  behind the idea of how that was being positioned, which was instead of thinking about doing  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:10:11):**  investments in 10 companies and for those 10 companies, let's not really worry about  
**[0:10:17-0:10:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:10:17):**  valuation and let's not worry so much that eight or nine of them fail. The one that succeeds  
**[0:10:24-0:10:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:10:24):**  or the one or two that succeeds will return all fund plus carry and everybody will be  
**[0:10:31-0:10:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:10:31):**  happy. But to make that model work, you need outside returns in comparison to historical  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:10:39):**  norms and the food and agriculture business has been around a long time. And so it was  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:10:46):**  pretty easy to see that there weren't going to be a lot of outsized return multiples from  
**[0:10:53-0:11:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:10:53):**  that. So the approach I took was, well, let's not try to say that's what we're going to  
**[0:11:03-0:11:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:11:03):**  do instead, let's solve for just lower failure rates. Let's just have less companies fail  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:11:11):**  and let's really think about how systems investing and engaging with companies post investment  
**[0:11:18-0:11:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:11:18):**  and taking this more sort of holistic approach to it will just position companies better  
**[0:11:25-0:11:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:11:25):**  for succeeding. For S2G, a key part of this approach was bringing in lots of experts because  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:11:32):**  they appreciated that ag is a complex system and that having deep expertise in all parts  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:11:37):**  of it would be impossible. They had a saying at the time that guided this way of thinking.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:11:42):**  There was a saying at the time, if we were the smartest people in the room, we were in  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:11:49):**  the wrong room. And that was kind of the spirit of what we're doing. We really wanted to learn,  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:11:56):**  really wanted to do what's best for the companies in the portfolio and how do we bring the right  
**[0:12:02-0:12:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:12:02):**  investors who understood the DNA and the aspirations of those companies and could really add value  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:12:10):**  as those companies moved through the growth. A story that illustrates this approach is  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:12:16):**  one of S2G's investments, a grass fed dairy company called Maple Hill Creamery that operates  
**[0:12:22-0:12:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:12:22):**  in the Northeast of the US. At the time when S2G invested around 2014, there weren't really  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:12:29):**  any grass fed dairy companies. Grass fed wasn't a brand differentiator for consumers who are  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:12:35):**  still thinking mostly about organic. S2G saw the potential for Maple Hill to define this  
**[0:12:40-0:12:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:12:40):**  new standard, but they knew they needed help. So they brought in other experts as co-investors.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:12:47):**  I personally nor did S2G at the time have any experience in grass fed as a subsector.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:12:55):**  And so we sought out a fund called Armonia. Armonia had done, it's a dedicated fund in  
**[0:13:02-0:13:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:13:02):**  the US solely on doing grass fed work, mostly on the grass fed beef side, but a lot of those  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:13:10):**  same principles from a systems perspective apply to dairy as they did on beef. And for  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:13:16):**  Armonia, they felt getting a broader expertise on the dairy side would help them on their  
**[0:13:22-0:13:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:13:22):**  beef investments. And we would benefit from Armonia's experience on understanding about  
**[0:13:29-0:13:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:13:29):**  Savory Institute and diversity on soil and on the paddocks and how they're managed and  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:13:36):**  the standards that the consumer are looking for and regional standards versus national  
**[0:13:43-0:13:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:13:43):**  standards, all of that stuff, which as a team, we just started working together. And that  
**[0:13:50-0:14:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:13:50):**  company really found its tipping point when we built up the supply from, first it was  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:14:00):**  like 20, 30 farms in upstate New York, and those could have been like retired hippies  
**[0:14:07-0:14:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:14:07):**  all the way to other sort of Amish and Mennonite dairy farmers. And so you had to work both  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:14:15):**  as an investor, but also most importantly, the company in finding a way to create the  
**[0:14:21-0:14:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:14:21):**  first scalable, consistent, incentivized supply chain for grass fed milk in the US. And we  
**[0:14:30-0:14:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:14:30):**  did all that hard work as a group and you need an investor group that really was mission  
**[0:14:37-0:14:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:14:37):**  driven.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:14:38):**  Over time, Maple Hill Creamery has become the number one selling liquid milk at Whole  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:14:42):**  Foods. Another key to their success that also speaks to the system's approach has been ensuring  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:14:48):**  their strong incentives and support for the farmers that supply Maple Hill Creamery. Victor  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:14:54):**  explains how Tim Joseph, the founder, was able to think from a farmer's perspective  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:14:59):**  and how critical this was when scaling up their supply.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:15:02):**  Okay. How about, you know, he starts with one farm and now he's got to get two and then  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:15:07):**  he's got to get five and then he's got to get 10. Like how does he build this sort of  
**[0:15:10-0:15:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:15:10):**  supply chain and get people who've been doing it all one way for so long to take a leap  
**[0:15:18-0:15:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:15:18):**  of faith into a new brand and a new way of thinking about how to manage their farms.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:15:26):**  And so he found, you know, the first farm, I think it was like a kind of retired hippie  
**[0:15:32-0:15:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:15:32):**  couple in upstate New York and they really loved the grass fed approach. They wholeheartedly  
**[0:15:42-0:15:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:15:42):**  integrated into the farm management and they became the model. And so the incentives for  
**[0:15:50-0:15:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:15:50):**  becoming a grass fed dairy farmer giving off take to Maple Hill Creamery at the time, the  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:15:59):**  dynamics were that the conventional dairy market was collapsing. There are incredible  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:16:04):**  amount of bankruptcies, processing facilities that have been doing conventional dairy up  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:16:10):**  and up the state of New York. We're all going out of business. Organic, you know, certainly  
**[0:16:15-0:16:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:16:15):**  it had its heyday, but from a pricing standpoint that was under a lot of pressure. And so,  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:16:23):**  you know, you had these conventional dairy farms who had converted over to organic or  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:16:29):**  farms that just started out organic and they thought that those premiums were going to  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:16:34):**  kind of go on forever, but the, there was a lot of pricing pressure put on there. So  
**[0:16:39-0:16:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:16:39):**  that was starting to cause instability within the organic market in upstate New York. So  
**[0:16:45-0:16:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:16:45):**  here comes little sort of Maple Hill Creamery, which ultimately could sell that they were  
**[0:16:53-0:17:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:16:53):**  kind of a lifeboat. And so they set up a pricing system. So I think at the time, if I remember  
**[0:17:00-0:17:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:17:00):**  correctly, conventional milk was going, I don't know, $16 a hundred weight. Organic  
**[0:17:09-0:17:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:17:09):**  was going for $24 a hundred weight. And some Maple Hill basically said, listen, if you  
**[0:17:18-0:17:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:17:18):**  come into our network as a grass fed dairy supplier, we'll give you $38 a hundred weight,  
**[0:17:26-0:17:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:17:26):**  just right off the bat, which was a big carrot for change at that point, given how much pressure  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:17:33):**  all of those conventional organic dairy farms are having. And then they went one step further  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:17:39):**  and they said, okay, we're going to set the baseline at $38 a hundred weight. But if you're  
**[0:17:45-0:17:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:17:45):**  a seasonal supplier, we'll give you the $38. But if you become a year round supplier, we'll  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:17:53):**  give you an extra dollar a hundred weight. If you start doing rotational grazing, you  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:17:59):**  know, on your paddocks, you know, and put in fencing, we'll give you another dollar  
**[0:18:04-0:18:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:18:04):**  a hundred weight. And so they kept building these price incentives that inspired farmers  
**[0:18:12-0:18:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:18:12):**  to do more, to make their farms operate at a standard that allowed Maple Hill to get  
**[0:18:19-0:18:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:18:19):**  consistency in their milk supply from a farm by farm by farm basis. And then on top of  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:18:26):**  that, they did something that as a small company, it's still amazing that they were able to  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:18:31):**  pull this off, which is that they realized that, you know, it takes time to really approach  
**[0:18:37-0:18:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:18:37):**  your farms from a grass fed perspective, even if you're coming from organic. And so if you  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:18:46):**  pledged your, your off take from your farm, you know, to Maple Hill and become an exclusive  
**[0:18:52-0:18:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:18:52):**  supplier, they would then buy your organic, even before you'd become a certified sort  
**[0:18:58-0:19:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:18:58):**  of grass fed supplier, they would buy your organic at sort of market price, guarantee  
**[0:19:05-0:19:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:19:05):**  it. And then they would work, Maple Hill would then work that supply to sell it off into  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:19:12):**  the organic markets for whatever period of time, whether it was six months, eight months,  
**[0:19:17-0:19:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:19:17):**  a year, you know, year and a half for that farm to convert from organic to grass fed.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:19:24):**  And that was really for a small yogurt company, you know, that was an incredible lift. And  
**[0:19:30-0:19:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:19:30):**  I'm very proud of the work that they did to really reinvigorate the dairy farms in upstate  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:19:38):**  New York and create a financial incentive and an upside and security for farms that  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:19:44):**  were really under an amazing amount of pressure.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:19:47):**  Another area that Victor has invested in that has big impacts on producers is plant based  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:19:51):**  protein. Victor was an early investor in Beyond Meat, a company that has recently had one  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:19:57):**  of the most successful IPOs in history. This space is controversial for sure. But Victor  
**[0:20:03-0:20:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:20:03):**  sees that it's creating some big opportunities, including for producers, as plant based companies  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:20:09):**  look to expand their supply chains beyond just pea protein isolate and soy, which are  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:20:13):**  the common inputs used today.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:20:16):**  There's a lot of experimentation going on now, you know, around different pulses and  
**[0:20:21-0:20:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:20:21):**  sort of chickpeas and those show real potential. But those crops need to have kind of a denser  
**[0:20:32-0:20:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:20:32):**  protein content to it. So, you know, what can be done on the hybridization side to kind  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:20:39):**  of up the protein levels within those crops? How do you start thinking about, you know,  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:20:45):**  rotations and the like, you know, to do that? How do you think about hybridization, you  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:20:49):**  know, to do that and approach to genetics? So, you know, there's a lot of work that's  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:20:55):**  going to be done not only to just increase the volume, which I think is an opportunity  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:21:01):**  right here right now for supporting the all protein sector. But then what are the new  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:21:07):**  protein sources that are agriculturally based that are going to come in to help create more  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:21:13):**  complexity in the burger, bring more, a deeper taste profile, more umami. You know, there's  
**[0:21:19-0:21:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:21:19):**  a lot of things that are going to keep evolving that I think farmers can play a role in with  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:21:28):**  these companies and with these products to build a better product.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:21:33):**  More broadly than just plant-based, Victor is also watching some macro trends in the  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:21:37):**  food system that he believes are also creating big opportunities for farmers.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:21:43):**  Maybe I'm just being the eternal optimist here, but I think the coming decades are going  
**[0:21:51-0:22:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:21:51):**  to become a golden era for farmers. I think the types of crops, the focus on nutrition,  
**[0:22:04-0:22:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:22:04):**  the focus on differentiation that the consumer is having, the focus on farming practices  
**[0:22:13-0:22:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:22:13):**  and the like, I think that is going to provide farmers with an incredible opportunity. And  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:22:22):**  the major transformation that's going to happen is that we're going to move from commodity  
**[0:22:27-0:22:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:22:27):**  to identity. I think commodity as an idea has a timestamp on it. I think the entire  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:22:35):**  system for the last 50, 60 years have been, you know, on an agricultural side has been  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:22:39):**  focused on the idea of commodity, that there's a select number, you know, limited set of  
**[0:22:45-0:22:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:22:45):**  crops that ultimately it doesn't matter where it comes from or how it was grown, you know,  
**[0:22:53-0:22:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:22:53):**  what above and beyond, you know, kind of the top level specs, you know, what's in it that's  
**[0:22:59-0:23:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:22:59):**  ultimately ubiquitous, that it's used, that it's interchangeable. All of that approach  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:23:06):**  I think is coming to an end. And what's going to come next, you know, for a consumer that  
**[0:23:12-0:23:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:23:12):**  actually cares is, you know, how things are farmed, what crops are nutrient dense, what  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:23:21):**  soil practices have been undertaken. And if you can do all of those things right, if you  
**[0:23:26-0:23:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:23:26):**  could pick the right crops and the right rotations and do farming in a way that creates more,  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:23:35):**  you know, value, there's going to be a premium that people are going to pay for that because  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:23:41):**  a commodity system in which we've bred out nutrients and we've bred out flavor and we've  
**[0:23:46-0:23:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:23:46):**  bred out all of these things are now being highly valued. And that's going to move us  
**[0:23:53-0:24:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:23:53):**  to an entirely different approach to farming. And for the farmers who see that future and  
**[0:24:01-0:24:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:24:01):**  can really curate the crops, you know, to those markets and do the harder work up front  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:24:10):**  in terms of farming practices, but ultimately, you know, like you, I share the technology  
**[0:24:14-0:24:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:24:14):**  and new science are really going to help farmers make that transition to this higher value  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:24:22):**  identity preserved market.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:24:25):**  Realizing this future will be hard, really hard. But Victor says that, at least in the  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:24:30):**  US, there are market signals that it's already happening. For example, big food companies  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:24:35):**  that have scaled up organic brands have been dependent on sourcing their organic grains  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:24:39):**  from overseas. But nowadays, they're losing confidence in these supply chains. And this  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:24:45):**  is leading to change and opportunities.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:24:48):**  The big food manufacturers who have been importing all of this organic grain from places like  
**[0:24:56-0:25:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:24:56):**  Turkey and Crimea, which are not the hotbeds of stability and likely aren't organic or  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:25:06):**  not always organic, but you're paying that organic premium. But you actually don't know  
**[0:25:10-0:25:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:25:10):**  whether what you have is authentically organic. You're going to need a domestic supply in  
**[0:25:17-0:25:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:25:17):**  the US of verifiable organic grains. And your brands and your company's market cap are now  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:25:29):**  tied to your ability to make these transitions.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:25:34):**  And so they're starting to do 6, 7, 8, 9, 10-year forward contracts, locking in premium  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:25:43):**  prices to stabilize those supply chains, to allow the growth of those brands that have  
**[0:25:49-0:25:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:25:49):**  to transition to organic to do so. I'm not saying that's widespread, but it is the start  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:25:58):**  of a set of systems players in which there are shared values and shared interests and  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:26:05):**  shared risks that they need to solve. They're taking a long view on how to do that. And  
**[0:26:12-0:26:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:26:12):**  that is an opportunity for farmers.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:26:15):**  Victor recently visited Australia, representing his nonprofit, Foodshot Global. Foodshot Global  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:26:20):**  is a consortium of companies that are focused on creating a food system that's more healthy,  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:26:25):**  sustainable, and equitable. I was fortunate to meet up with Victor while he was here.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:26:30):**  And I also asked him for a few reflections on his trip and the ag tech and food ecosystem  
**[0:26:36-0:26:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:26:36):**  here in Australia.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:26:38):**  I was just really quite blown away at the level of innovation that's there. I think  
**[0:26:46-0:26:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:26:46):**  you have some world-class universities that are doing some important work on the R&D side.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:26:55):**  And investor groups starting to come into that ecosystem to really help turn those research  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:27:02):**  opportunities into commercial and more entrepreneurial companies. And so it's really just fascinating  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:27:09):**  for me to see a start of all of that, of the dots being connected. And from a Foodshot  
**[0:27:15-0:27:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:27:15):**  Global perspective, we are seeking to help be part of that dot connecting and then also  
**[0:27:21-0:27:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:27:21):**  to bring Australia into the work that we're doing on a global basis from Foodshot Global.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:27:29):**  So as a result of that, we had some great meetings, some partnerships that are in the  
**[0:27:34-0:27:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:27:34):**  process of formation. So I'm hoping to get back there pretty soon to start formalizing  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:27:42):**  some of those relationships and bringing them into our protein challenge, which we'll be  
**[0:27:46-0:27:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:27:46):**  launching in the next couple of months. But most importantly, just to get back to Melbourne  
**[0:27:52-0:28:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:27:52):**  so I can eat some more of that food because that is a damn good food town.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:28:00):**  I'm looking forward to Victor's next visit and to following what he's up to at S2G and  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=444059#t=0:28:04):**  Foodshot Global. Links for both of these organizations are in the show notes and on the blog. And

### Agtech - So What?  (2021-08-25)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  I'm Sarah Nolet.  We often hear agtech startups making some pretty bold statements, like wanting to feed  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:00:13):**  the world or to revolutionize the entire food system.  But usually, despite being ambitious, they're only targeting a part of the system.  Today's guest, Matt Crisp, co-founder and CEO at Benson Hill, is having a real crack  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:00:27):**  at some big changes along the whole value chain â€” how food is produced, supplied,  and even conceptualized.  But it didn't start out that way.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:00:36):**  Back in 2012, the company was working in plant biology, using analytics and machine learning  to increase crop yields.  Now, Benson Hill is a team of 350 and fast becoming a vertically integrated food and  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:00:48):**  ingredients business, producing high-protein soybeans and yellow peas to fuel the growing  plant-based protein industry.  When you're saying, I've got a closed loop, two-sided business model with farmer engagement  
**[0:01:00-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:01:00):**  and this portfolio of products and crop innovation at the core of it, like, it's kind of complicated.  It might be complicated to explain, but some big players are listening.  Benson Hill, backed by investors such as Google Ventures, Lewis & Clark, Prelude, and Wheat  
**[0:01:15-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:01:15):**  Chief announced in May that this year its intention is to go public through a SPAC.  So what is Benson Hill's business model and how do they plan to revolutionize the plant-based  protein value chain?  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:01:26):**  Well, let's meet Matt, who started his career in finance, joining a VC firm as a research  assistant and then eventually becoming the firm's managing director.  Yeah, well, I mean, I had a really fortunate opportunity at a young age to start in an  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:01:41):**  industry that most folks don't get to it until a little bit later, but it was a remarkable  learning ground for me.  Is it different?  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:01:50):**  Yeah, I think in many respects, and my shameless, of course, plug for food and ag investing  and that VC needs to invest more in food and ag, I'd say that that's certainly picked up.  But when I joined Venture, it was really a principal focus, of course, around technology  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:05):**  and the life sciences.  And I spent most of my time growing up in that industry in the life sciences and then  fortunately was able to learn and gain a lot of exposure to how technology and science  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:19):**  innovation really could take hold in non nutritional health care industries.  So it's good to see it.  It's good to see the space have evolved.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:27):**  And obviously there's a lot more capital being deployed into these categories we care so  much about right now.  I feel like ag tech often gets compared, like it's somewhere between software and tech and  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:39):**  life sciences.  It's kind of not really either.  Do you feel like that's a fair characterization?  
**[0:02:43-0:02:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:43):**  Yeah, I mean, when we think about like the technology that empowers innovation in these  areas, there's more similarities than differences, right?  I mean, sensor tech, sequencing, genotyping, the cloud, AI, ML.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:59):**  I mean, these things are delivering innovation and cost curve benefits across transportation  and energy and a broad spectrum of categories.  So I don't know if I'd say that it fits per se.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:13):**  Similarly, though, we struggle with this idea that there's ag tech and food tech and ag  food tech.  And I actually think if we look at those bookends, that's actually a more fun discussion because  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:28):**  we don't often pay as much attention to how they should work in sync with one another.  Yeah, I think the temptation is to split them up and say, oh, I look after the sector, you  look after this sector because VCs need to resource their team appropriately to dig into  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:43):**  different areas.  But I guess, well, and this is what Benson Hill really does is kind of connecting the  two and thinking about how they can become more of the same thing and look at them together.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:53):**  Before we come to Benson Hill, do you like you were looking, I think, in life sciences  world a little bit at synthetic biology as well and some of the bleed over from approaches  in the life sciences area into ag.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:06):**  Any kind of lessons or examples of how that experience has helped you look at ag differently?  Yeah, I mean, that was really the impetus for me to get interested in this space.  I would tell you that there's just when you come from that world and principally are focused  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:22):**  on human health care and then you look over into food and ag eight, 10, 12 years ago,  it's kind of deflating.  I think it's, I'm going to use the word pathetic, how little investment and innovation was really  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:35):**  occurring in this area, which constitutes more than 5% of our global GDP.  It's responsible for all the food that we eat.  I mean, my goodness.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:46):**  Is there an opportunity space?  Yeah.  I think you learned, I didn't come up in food and ag.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:51):**  I don't have a background in it, but you learn quickly that, again, a lot of those same enabling  technologies can propel this industry forward in ways that it already has for human health  care 20 years ago.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:05:04):**  Understanding that, capturing that is really motivating.  Frankly, it created, I think, and is still in many respects, a lot of opportunity for  innovative startups, entrepreneurs.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:05:15):**  Maybe one other thing that I'd add is that when the pharma industry is really getting  kicked off, and when I say farm, I mean like the ecosystem of life sciences and small companies,  entrepreneurs, and contract research organizations that were delivering innovation in the late  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:05:30):**  90s and early 2000s, it was in a larger respect catalyzed by the fact that all the really,  really, really big pharmaceutical companies had laid off like thousands of people.  You had all these really smart folks that were like, hey, I can do innovation.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:05:46):**  It went from 80% of the new drugs that were approved for use in the US came from big pharmaceutical  companies and 20% from small to today, 80% come from small companies and 20% come from  big companies.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:06:04):**  I feel like we're in that shift right now where you've got all this consolidation with  these really big ag seed input companies and others, and there's an incredible plethora  of talent out there.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:06:16):**  It's like, hey, here's a cool opportunity to take people who are super well informed  and a lot of interdisciplinary skill sets and pilot them towards innovation and opportunity.  Maybe that's one of the reasons we're seeing more VC pick up as well.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:06:32):**  I hope that that is true and that we get that talent coming.  I also know that the shift from big company to small startup can be a tough one.  I guess what was your shift like from the venture side to the operating side?  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:06:45):**  Yeah, well, I've never worked for a big company, so I've never had to endure that shift or  evolution.  The shift from venture to the other side of the table, for me personally, was really uplifting.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:06:57):**  I think I was, in many respects, born to be a builder, an entrepreneur, an operator.  While I liked venture a lot, and I mean, it was what a remarkable place to learn about  a lot of stuff, you never have to really live with your bad habits.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:07:13):**  It's like being a consultant and you go and you do stuff or work with folks to try to  do stuff and it might be for a few weeks or a few months.  That's a cool experience.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:07:24):**  Seeing that through, I think, was something that I always felt a little empty about.  Jumping across to be an entrepreneur and to bring something to life, this all was catalyzed  by the fact that I was with what was previously a portfolio company and I got let go.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:07:41):**  I got canned.  Two months later, I told my wife, who was pregnant with our first child at the time,  I don't want to go get a real job, which is a very interesting dinner conversation.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:07:57):**  She says, well, what are you going to do?  Benson Hill was, of course, in its embryonic stage.  I spoke with her about it and said, hopefully, honey, we can work on this thing.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:13):**  Six or eight months from now, we can get it funded and then I can get a paycheck.  It was 37 months later, I brought home a paycheck.  I think she's been really supportive because of that personal zeal and passion that I had  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:32):**  for not only just building, but building what we're building, which is obviously really  motivating.  How did you even come across Benson Hill?  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:40):**  Were you part of the original idea or met the team or how did that all happen?  Yeah, I'm a co-founder.  I'm not a scientist.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:48):**  I'm a generalist.  I teamed up with some scientists who helped co-found the company.  Really the thesis was we can utilize the computational knowledge.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:02):**  At the time, I don't think we were using terms like AI, but we can use computational biology  and the horsepower that these new analytical tools and machine learning could bring and  combine that with human intelligence and plant scientists and what have you.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:18):**  I call it the early convergence of data science and plant science, two of the three now pillars  of combination at Benson Hill.  We focused on sustainability traits.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:28):**  We've hatched this idea that, look, we can use the natural genetic diversity of plants.  We can develop plants that can yield more by capturing sunlight more efficiently, converting  it to carbon more efficiently.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:42):**  And that was the first years of the company.  And then a few years ago, we decided, look, a lot of the same infrastructure that we built  out, we call it CropOS, that's our technology platform short for crop operating system,  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:54):**  can be used for things like nutrition as well.  And that was really a big leap for us because we were saying that we wanted to move beyond  the farm gate.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:03):**  We wanted to move beyond the farmer only model and ag inputs.  And we wanted to go to a consumer model.  And we felt like with a technology platform, we had the basis to transcend that, to connect  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:16):**  indeed the interests of the grower and the consumer.  And that, frankly, is where I felt like we as a company really did hit our stride in  a lot of ways and have accelerated the business.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:29):**  Tell me a little bit more about that in detail.  So like original business model, who is the customer?  What did you do?  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:34):**  And then how did you think about changing and evolving that?  And where is it up to now?  Yeah.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:39):**  So like in that initial model, your gateway to the market, the ag input market was really  a big seed company.  So we were in dialogue with all the big seed companies and we're talking about co-developments  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:49):**  of traits and these kinds of things.  But what you realize pretty quickly is that if you're not able to control your own destiny  to your own channel to that market, which in this case was really principally the farmer,  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:11:02):**  man, you could spend a lot of time and wait and probably participate in a pretty tiny  manner on the other side of it.  And so the evolution was, OK, if we can use the technology platform to evolve past the  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:11:15):**  farm gate, we changed the dynamic of who cares, right?  Because now it's not just the farmer who cares, but the consumer.  And that could be met through a consumer package, good company or an ingredient company or brand,  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:11:29):**  a quick service restaurant.  I mean, you really open up a lot.  And then the second part, and this is important, particularly when it came to raising larger  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:11:37):**  amounts of venture capital, is that we moved from a total addressable market that might  be 30 or 40 billion dollars to addressable markets that are hundreds of billions and  even trillions of dollars.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:11:49):**  So clicking down the value chain a couple places opens up a huge amount of additional  opportunity.  And so and so now we're doing both.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:11:58):**  Now we're in dialogue with both of those types of companies.  But for a portfolio of products that is really intended to add value across the chain.  Capturing consumer demands and moving all the way upstream to seed genetics requires  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:12:11):**  a lot of different skill sets.  Talking agronomy to a grower is very different than talking market research to a CPG company.  For Benson Hill, pursuing the opportunity led to a shift in their business model.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:12:24):**  When you think about a consumer packaged goods company, and we had we hosted one of them  four years or so ago, five years, four or five years ago, when we were really developing  in earnest some of our very early CRISPR technology.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:12:37):**  And they wanted to learn about your CRISPR technology.  How can I use CRISPR technology and my ingredients and etcetera?  And we did this whole two, three hour onsite visit.

And they sort of all looked around at each other and they looked at us and they were  like, look, we think this is really cool, but we buy ingredients and you guys are like  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:12:59):**  three clicks away from us.  So when you can ship us these ingredients, like call me because we'll be really interested.  And what I tell you that sort of because it just it brings to the top of your mind, like,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:13:10):**  I've got to meet if I intend to participate in that market, I've got to meet my customer  where they are.  Right.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:13:17):**  I can't expect them to backward integrate to wherever it's comfortable for me.  And so that evolution and realizations, insights like that were really the catalyst for us  just to go to our stakeholder base investors board and say, look, we've got to do the hard  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:13:35):**  work to innovate the business model to meet these kinds of organizations.  And it's probably the only way we're really going to get escape velocity for the kinds  of ideas that we're trying to put forward in the market.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:13:48):**  And we were, I mean, again, super fortunate to form capital around that.  And now looking three or four years ahead since then to today, I mean, we're delivering  tens of millions of dollars of ingredient solutions to these kinds of companies and  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:14:03):**  others.  And it's, I think, frankly, this marriage of technological innovation with business  model innovation that's helped us bring that to life.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:14:13):**  Right.  When you had those original insights around, okay, we've got to work with food companies  and downstream, and then you had to go to your board and investors.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:14:22):**  Did that feel like, what was that like?  Was it like, oh shit, we're totally pivoting the business model.  Are they going to be on board or was it like, oh wow, we've unlocked this whole new opportunity  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:14:30):**  and they're absolutely going to love it.  I would say that at the time, and I don't think they'd mind me saying, but when you  take venture capitalists who have a return profile, they need 30, 50% hurdle rates, return  
**[0:14:43-0:14:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:14:43):**  rates, and you say, I'm going to go purchase some lower margin asset because I think that,  I mean, and I'm going to spend your money to do it.  I mean, there's a lot of like, what?  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:14:57):**  You're going to do what?  And so we had to really carefully analyze the viability of this.  I mean, like I said, I've never worked for a big company, right?  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:15:10):**  We needed to fill talent gaps to have folks who understood how to run a plant.  We've built an organization principally around technologies and science development and that  kind of innovation.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:15:22):**  So yeah, it was an interesting evolution of dialogue that took a bit, but when we had  some new financiers come to the table, they really, really, really embraced us as well.  And as I think the collective group began to understand and truly appreciate that this  
**[0:15:45-0:15:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:15:45):**  is a fundable concept, but it creates an opportunity for us to become a really, really big company  over time.  And that's a leap.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:15:55):**  I mean, that is a leap, but that was a difficult moment in our evolution.  I wouldn't call it a pivot.  I'd call it a drastic evolution of our identity.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:16:10):**  Vertically integrating was a pretty significant evolution and not an easy one, but Benson  Hill saw a big opportunity, especially with the growth in plant-based foods.  It's true vertical integration where we're either acquiring or we're partnering in a  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:16:24):**  pretty, initially what you would have deemed at that stage of our life cycle to be a capital  intensive manner.  So spending dollars on hard assets and on relationships and collaborations that provided  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:16:37):**  us access to the supply chain.  That I use Dakota Ingredients as an example.  This is a yellow pea dry fractionation facility we own that produces pea protein concentrate  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:16:47):**  in North Dakota.  It's part of our yellow pea strategy as a company.  It's the fastest growing legume in the human food protein ingredients market.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:16:58):**  We've got a remarkably strong program on the technical side that's been going on now for  years and marrying those kinds of things along with the grower network, along with an existing  customer base, it irrefutably is creating synergistic value.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:17:13):**  But that's the kind of thing we made a bet and that was years ago and now we're really  seeing it come to life.  Was it also a bet on the plant-based protein industry or like you guys started in soy and  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:17:23):**  you've now looked at pea?  How did you know that that industry was one to go after?  Yeah, that's a great question.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:17:31):**  So I mean, we predicted, I mean, this wasn't a prediction as much as it was an early indicator,  but beyond meat popularized in a lot of ways, yellow pea.  If you'd asked me 10 years ago, what is yellow pea?  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:17:42):**  I would have said, I don't know, a yellow green pea.  Like I don't know.  So it became popularized and it like soy are the two of what are soon to be many drivers  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:17:58):**  of base protein ingredients for the alternative plant-based category.  Now we're familiar, right, five, 10 years ago, more so with dairy and that obtained  a certain degree of market share, but the advent of the plant-based movement and particularly  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:18:14):**  plant-based or non-animal protein, broadly non-animal protein.  There's a lot of signals that track back several years.  It's obviously more evident to us in the last 18 to 24 months given beyond, given the pandemic  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:18:28):**  actually accelerating those trends, given the fact that consumers will pay green premiums  now for these kinds of goods, whereas the data might not have supported that thesis  even five years ago.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:18:41):**  So I'd say we knew we wanted to get into nutrition.  We knew we wanted to reach the consumer and this seemed like the most aggressively accelerating  category to begin placing a bet on, not to be the brand, right, but to be more, as we  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:18:57):**  like to say, this picks and shovels like the backend, so to say.  And in plant-based protein, I imagine it's attractive as well because there's several  consumer facing attributes that you can start to impact like nutrition, maybe flavor, I  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:11):**  don't know, like requiring less flavor maskers or environmental properties around carbon  sequestration or making them easier to extrude.  Like what kinds of consumer facing attributes are you targeting just to bring that to life?  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:22):**  Yeah, sure.  So I'll be specific with like we call it UHP soy, ultra high protein soy, and it's really,  I'll call it, it's like a product platform.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:32):**  The idea here is you can increase the nutrition density in the bean itself so high that you  actually disintermediate some of the processing, the most expensive processing step that's  required in between what today is a commodity, soybean and a soy protein concentrate, which  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:50):**  is the number one ingredient, for instance, in the Impossible Burger.  So if you can ratchet up nutrition density such that you disintermediate that, it doesn't  necessarily mean that you're offering more protein in the immediate term, but you're  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:20:02):**  offering the same amount of protein, but you're ripping out a huge amount of the cost infrastructure  that's required to produce that ingredient and the carbon and the water that has to go  into that, right?  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:20:16):**  Not to mention that because it's fully integrated and I can look all the way back to the field  from which these crops came, I can tell you, did this farmer use regenerative practices?  You know, what kind of applications did they use?  
**[0:20:29-0:20:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:20:29):**  And then over time, due to the point you made earlier, you have, we have databases of these  beans and we can understand their amino acid profiles, their flavor profiles, and we're  selecting for those things such that we can continuously improve upon them and screen  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:20:46):**  against them.  And then the last thing, and I think this is frankly the most important one that really  doesn't get talked about very much at all, and that is affordability.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:20:55):**  The real magnificent unlock, I think, of this category, it's going to be, you know, can  I buy it?  And I mean by I, the proverbial mass market.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:07):**  If we cannot get a better cost profile to this stuff down to the consumer level, we're  not going to realize the latent demand that's there.  This is not, you're not going to get to it.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:19):**  How do you balance that with the facts that we spend, you know, single digit percents  of income on food and to kind of truly move the needle, maybe we need to be actually paying  more yet there is, you know, significant issues around food insecurity.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:33):**  Like at some point someone's sitting without a chair and the music stopped.  I guess, how do you, how do those 10 to two facts sit with you?  Yeah, we spend in the United States more just on diet related chronic disease per year than  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:47):**  we do on all food that we eat combined.  Right?  I mean, I actually mentioned this to our farmer partners in the session last week as well.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:58):**  And I mean, you want to talk about ridiculous and we're so productive when we've done such  a good job of producing these calories and you say like, look, we've created a system  and deed of abundance.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:10):**  And I'd argue that we've gone from, you know, the dialogue around food security or insecurity  to really what is more importantly needs to be a dialogue around nutrition security or  insecurity.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:23):**  Right.  And so should we consumers who can afford it be willing to pay more for food proportionally,  you know, to how we spend our income?  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:32):**  Absolutely.  But there's a lot of folks who, you know, are spending everything that they can afford  to spend on food, and they're not being given the nutrition that they deserve.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:43):**  Right.  And so that I think is the paradigm of unlock where we don't we don't necessarily have to  up in the system.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:50):**  But we've got to embrace the notions of how we've produced at scale, which is great, and  use that infrastructure at a lot of levels.  But we got to do it in a mirror that's delivering outcomes that translate to human health.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:23:05):**  And in talking about delivering new types of food at scale, Matt uses Amazon as an analogy.  When we think about Amazon and what it did for, you know, folks who write books, you  know, authors, you previously had to go through sort of filter of I call it the the ivory  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:23:22):**  tower model of somebody up there is going to tell me whether I'm worthy or not.  And in an Amazon model, similar for musicians, you can create this sort of long tail effect  and you can open up access to markets to people who were previously not granted that under  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:23:40):**  the traditional schema.  Think about plants and all that they have to offer all the natural genetic diversity  is content, right?  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:23:49):**  Similarly, content that we deserve to have accessible to us.  It's there.  I mean, man, it's there.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:23:56):**  Right.  And the innovators have never really been empowered to bring that out, bring that to  bear, to bring that to a channel, to bring that to a consumer.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:24:05):**  I think over the next five, 10, 20 years, we'll see this long tail effect where the  cost curves of enabling technologies and the synergies that exist indeed between food science  and plant science and data science that we're really investing in become much more broadly  
**[0:24:22-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:24:22):**  accessible so that you've effectively got an ecosystem of innovation and you can create  more custom personalized nutrition solutions delivered by the diets that we consume.  I'm excited.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:24:36):**  I mean, I get super riled up.  I love that as a concept.  But you do and are still working at the constraints of biology.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:24:44):**  Biology is generally pretty slow.  We're not innovating microbes where we can turn them over every day.  We're innovating plants.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:24:50):**  We actually have to grow them out.  We're doing everything we possibly can to accelerate the speed of biology, to work at  the constraints of the systems that we use to create this nutrition.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:25:03):**  And my true hope is that in the next two years, we'll see this Amazon paradigm occur whereby  indeed we can access that long tail.  We can break away from the extremely restrictive diversity of genetics that we've currently  
**[0:25:18-0:25:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:25:18):**  effectively decided to consume.  Right.  I think one stat is 99.9% of our calories come from less than 0.1% of genetic diversity  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:25:31):**  of plants.  I mean, like, come on, we can do better than that.  Right.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:25:36):**  Yeah, it's super exciting.  One of the things that's had to change in the Amazon analogy is the actual physical  and logistics infrastructure of connecting supply and demand as much as the virtual marketplace.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:25:47):**  How do you see this world changing the physical supply chains?  And I don't know if you've got any examples, even if it's 10 years in the future and science  fictiony?  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:25:57):**  Well, you know, localized supply chains are definitely a topic of conversation that, you  know, and when I say localized, we maybe went from, in some people's lens, a global supply  chain to a national supply chain or even a regional supply chain as a goal to account  
**[0:26:15-0:26:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:26:15):**  for black swan events and disruptions like we've experienced in the last 18 months.  So is it a topic of conversation?  Yeah.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:26:26):**  But I think that it's an outgrowth of just a general thematic to de-commoditize, you  know, in many respects, the system.  That's a word that I actually love that word that gets thrown around a lot more recently.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:26:40):**  What we've got to remember, though, is that de-commoditization doesn't necessarily mean  niche or specialty.  Those things tend to be viewed from an investor return perspective and from a supply chain  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:26:53):**  perspective is mostly a pain in the butt.  Right.  Oh, my gosh.  
**[0:26:57-0:26:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:26:57):**  Like you want to trace around this tiny little amount of that.  And in reality, there's so much that we can learn from the massive scalable systems that  we've got.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:27:05):**  So you don't need to chunk it up and have like this row of this field in Wisconsin goes  to that grocery store.  We can get there.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:27:14):**  That's very aspirant and that's great.  And we could probably do it pretty efficiently with block chain and some other things.  But you don't have to.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:27:21):**  I mean, a lot of these things can be produced in an organized way and then routed in a responsible  way that isn't embarking on unsustainable transportation practices and other things  which could break the whole thing.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:27:34):**  You can achieve a degree of scale in a de-commoditized context.  So are we is that going to take time?  Heck yeah.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:27:43):**  And are we going to have to have some some wins, you know, in order to see that more  broadly adopted?  Yeah, that that's certainly the case.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:27:51):**  There are clearly a lot of pieces that still need to fall into place before we'll see de-commoditized,  genetically diverse, affordable and scalable supply chains and foods.  And to get there, we absolutely must involve growers.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:28:04):**  Benson Hill recently launched their food system innovators program, where early adopter farmers  help test technologies and crop trades.  What we're learning is, of course, you want as a partnership, you and our farmers want  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:28:19):**  to be able to use the same farm equipment, to be able to use the same input suppliers  often, right?  We're not trying to change that.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:28:27):**  We don't want to change in any drastic way the practices because you create adoption  risk, what have you, it is a shift for some growers we work with to grow non GMO.  So all the beans that we grow are non GMO, that requires, you know, a different kind  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:28:42):**  of practice.  I mean, it requires more tension.  It ultimately, you know, this is why the growers getting paid premiums to grow non GMO to begin  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:28:50):**  with.  And we're working with them to identify varieties that, you know, that further enhance the pricing  premiums and the value creation potential of those of those crops.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:00):**  But I'll tell you, it's just an iterative cycle.  And we're learning a lot from our from our farmer partners, we're expanding our network  factory more than doubled it since last year, and making sure that it's a dialogue, and  
**[0:29:12-0:29:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:12):**  that we're not just showing up and saying like, here's what it is we want you to do,  can you go do it, that I think has made all the difference.  What's an example of that?  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:21):**  Like, what's what's something that you've been able to take on or listen to?  Because I think the I'm hopeful that the dialogue is moving towards Yes, we need early adopters  involved, yes, we need to think about ways to engage them, it has to be a two way conversation.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:32):**  But then as soon as they give you feedback about something that's not on your roadmap,  and you've got other pressures, like, it's easy to listen, but then hard to go actually  act on that.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:40):**  Yeah, well, I'll give you a specific example.  So we've actually looked at how we can collect data from folks.  And the growers, you know, over the last year, kind of come back and said, look, this, that  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:52):**  you're adding work for me here, like, I've already set up the set of systems that do  like 80% of what it is that you're talking to me about, can you help me figure out how  to make this more seamless.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:05):**  And so we did a bit of back to the drawing board, frankly, to understand what mechanism  would work best for them and provide the most convenience, but still provide the kind of  data that that we need and that we can think we can use to help them enhance their practices.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:20):**  I don't think we've landed that plane perfectly.  But we've got a couple really, really strong pilots out this year, we got a couple really,  you know, some some early, I'll say feedback, that's just really positive about how we've  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:34):**  approached that problem and the systems that we've implemented.  And it becomes this bit of a white glove kind of effect, right?  We weren't intending to resource that we chose to resource that because the growers said,  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:46):**  look, I need you to get more engaged with me on this topic.  And it'll be a win win if we work together for several seasons.  And we've chosen to do that.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:54):**  And I'm too early to tell, but I think that it'll pay dividends for both sides of the  partnership.  Yeah, I'm not surprised I was gonna ask about some of the underpinning digital infrastructure  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:03):**  to get the data on like what's working, all that stuff that you guys need.  I'm not surprised you ran squarely into the interoperability challenge that everyone is  facing and that they don't want to enter data into a new system, even if they are getting  
**[0:31:15-0:31:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:15):**  premiums.  How do you think about selecting farmers for that program, like you want people who are  gonna be giving you feedback, are willing to try new things, but also aren't so far  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:25):**  on the adoption curve that they're not representative of others?  Yeah, well, one good thing we have going for us here is that it's not like in order for  us to meet our business goals, we need to go plan on millions and millions of acres.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:39):**  It's really quality over quantity.  So we went from 30,000 acres last year, 70,000 acres this year.  And when we think about that relative to the 80 some million acres of soil that's planted  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:50):**  in the United States, it's not a whole lot, right?  So I'm not trying to say we can be more selective, but I would say that we've been fortunate  to find growers who align very, very well with the values that we hold as a company  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:07):**  and who actually understand.  Neither side is blowing any smoke here.  We understand that there's a lot of value to be had to the extent that we can create  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:17):**  a very bilateral communication style and engagement.  Fair enough.  And what's in it for them?  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:24):**  Obviously there's premiums potentially on the line.  How do you think about like incentives and what's in it for them?  So we pay growers a premium on every bushel that they can produce.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:36):**  And so we've got a portfolio of non-GMO lines, but we're essentially paying them for three  things.  Number one, we're paying them for identity preservation, right?  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:46):**  Meaning they've got to keep it segregated from whatever other commodities that they've  got going on.  Number two, we're paying them for the non-GMO, right?  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:55):**  Because it may indeed require more attention.  And then lastly, as we're paying them some kind of premium for whatever it is that is  the type of crop that's being produced and if it's related to protein content, if it's  
**[0:33:07-0:33:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:07):**  related to some specialty trade.  So those are the inputs that essentially define incentives that we can offer.  What's the journey been like for you and going from four or five of you to 350, kind of moving  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:22):**  maybe what I'd categorize from founder to CEO?  Well, it's been a heck of a learning curve.  And I like to sometimes say, I've never been in a job in my life that I was qualified to  
**[0:33:34-0:33:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:34):**  be in.  I'm certainly maintaining that pattern.  But one thing I really believe in, and I saw examples of this early in my career and I've  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:44):**  just tried to emulate it is be curious.  I ask a lot of questions and sometimes people think I'm asking questions because I secretly  know the answer, but like 99% of the time I'm just asking because I want to know the  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:58):**  answer.  And what it engenders, I think, is some degree of trust, especially in the people that you  can surround yourself with who are a heck of a lot smarter than you and who bring these  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:08):**  kinds of experiences, which is what I also like to ask a lot of questions about is how  do things work and how they worked in the past and what hasn't worked.  And the other thing I'd tell you is that in my experience, and someone actually came up  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:20):**  recently with a better way to put this, but it was called like the art of tripling.  So when you're three people and then you're roughly 10, let's just say 10, and then 30  and then 90 or 100, and then 300, in my experience, that is a really, really good indicator of  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:38):**  sort of the cultural inflections you endure as a company.  When you're 30 people, everybody in the company can know everything that's going on.  Everyone knows everybody.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:48):**  When you're 100 people, you can't do that.  And it's really hard to grow up.  If you came from being 10 people to now you're 100, right?  
**[0:34:55-0:34:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:55):**  That's a really big difference.  And then 300, now you're like in the system process world.  So those are things that fortunately I've had some good coaches and supporters who have  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:08):**  helped me think through that and keep me, I wouldn't say all the time, but a lot of  times keep me out of the ditch.  The way I've heard that explained is every time you triple, everything breaks.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:19):**  So like be ready for it, which it sounds like.  That's a much more eloquent way.  Yeah, that's a much more eloquent way of putting it.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:26):**  I don't know.  The theory of tripling sounds nice.  It's a bit more positive than that.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:30):**  Everything breaks.  I want to come all the way back though to kind of investment models as we wrap up here.  You guys have just announced the SPAC.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:37):**  I guess I don't know how you'd phrase it, intention or success or path or what we had  to tell me a little bit about that decision.  And I guess any broader comments on the kind of SPAC model, especially for ag tech?  
**[0:35:50-0:35:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:50):**  Well, ag tech and food tech, agri-food tech, let's say again, not the most common area  for investment, not an incredibly well understood area, frankly.  So what a SPAC does that helps that is it allows you to disclose information to prospective  
**[0:36:10-0:36:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:10):**  partners and investors in sort of a behind the curtain mode.  You can bring them in and share much more detailed, confidential, medium term, even  long term information and walk them through in a lot of depth, the substantiation of that.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:27):**  You could have them engage with people under confidentiality that if you were just going  public through a traditional IPO, you can't do that.  And this is a tough category, in my opinion, for companies to build trust quickly because  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:43):**  the models are not super simple.  It's super simple if I have a consumer good or widget or a mousetrap or whatever, and  I'm just going to sell it and I'm going to sell this many or this many at this margin  
**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:53):**  or that margin.  It's a pretty linear way of thinking and it's easily adjustable by Wall Street.  When you're saying I've got a closed loop, two sided business model with farmer engagement  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:37:04):**  and this portfolio of products and crop innovation at the core of it, like it's kind of complicated.  And so I actually have enjoyed the SPAC IPO process because we've been able to bring folks  who've just done a tremendous amount of diligence and unpacked all these layers of things and  
**[0:37:24-0:37:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:37:24):**  then in turn helped us tell the market the compelling components of the story in a way  that that's led to a successful pipe, which we upsized and was oversubscribed.  And in that case, it sits beside the SPAC that together pulled the potential to bring

And so we signed the definitive merger agreement in May and we expect to close and be public  this quarter.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:37:52):**  So it's a really exciting time to accelerate the business.  It's interesting you talk about that in almost the opposite way I expected, where when people  are sort of criticizing the SPAC model, they say, oh, well, if a company goes public at  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:05):**  this kind of early stage when they are really complex, how do they kind of keep that stream  of information going to keep Wall Street happy versus just private markets where the investors  can take that time and can do that diligence?  
**[0:38:17-0:38:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:17):**  But I guess that's more comparing like SPAC to raising venture versus SPAC to traditional  IPO.  So I guess you've sort of turned what I might have perceived as a negative into a positive.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:27):**  Any comments on why go down this path versus raise another round and continue private?  Yeah, so when we actually knew, not knew, but we anticipated over a year or well over  a year ago, it's been now a year and a half, that the public markets were probably an appropriate  
**[0:38:45-0:38:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:45):**  place for Benson Hill to end up.  We began doing some pre IPO readiness or I'll call it public market readiness planning with  an outside consultant who helped us sort of inventory the things that we would need to  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:57):**  be doing on a roadmap over the course of the next one to three years.  So when last year, you know, the SPAC market piped up and which I mean, if you had asked  me 18 months ago, what a SPAC is, I wouldn't have been able to answer the question.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:39:10):**  But when it became what is now more popular to go public by a SPAC than it is a traditional  IPO, we paid attention, we convened late last year.  And we said, look, if we feel like this is the this is where we want to be as a company,  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:39:26):**  and we had just achieved some pretty big milestones in that fourth quarter last year, you know,  the board, we had a consensus view like, hey, let's let's make this happen.  And that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.

**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:00:32):**  and even conceptualized.

**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:00:36):**  Back in 2012, the company was working in plant biology, using analytics and machine learning

**[0:01:00-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:01:00):**  and this portfolio of products and crop innovation at the core of it, like, it's kind of complicated.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:01:07):**  It might be complicated to explain, but some big players are listening.

**[0:01:25-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:01:25):**  protein value chain?  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:01:26):**  Well, let's meet Matt, who started his career in finance, joining a VC firm as a research  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:01:31):**  assistant and then eventually becoming the firm's managing director.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:01:34):**  Yeah, well, I mean, I had a really fortunate opportunity at a young age to start in an  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:01:41):**  industry that most folks don't get to it until a little bit later, but it was a remarkable  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:01:47):**  learning ground for me.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:01:49):**  Is it different?  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:01:50):**  Yeah, I think in many respects, and my shameless, of course, plug for food and ag investing  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:01:55):**  and that VC needs to invest more in food and ag, I'd say that that's certainly picked up.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:00):**  But when I joined Venture, it was really a principal focus, of course, around technology  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:05):**  and the life sciences.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:07):**  And I spent most of my time growing up in that industry in the life sciences and then  
**[0:02:12-0:02:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:12):**  fortunately was able to learn and gain a lot of exposure to how technology and science  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:19):**  innovation really could take hold in non nutritional health care industries.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:24):**  So it's good to see it.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:26):**  It's good to see the space have evolved.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:27):**  And obviously there's a lot more capital being deployed into these categories we care so  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:32):**  much about right now.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:33):**  I feel like ag tech often gets compared, like it's somewhere between software and tech and  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:39):**  life sciences.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:40):**  It's kind of not really either.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:41):**  Do you feel like that's a fair characterization?  
**[0:02:43-0:02:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:43):**  Yeah, I mean, when we think about like the technology that empowers innovation in these  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:50):**  areas, there's more similarities than differences, right?  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:53):**  I mean, sensor tech, sequencing, genotyping, the cloud, AI, ML.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:02:59):**  I mean, these things are delivering innovation and cost curve benefits across transportation  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:06):**  and energy and a broad spectrum of categories.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:10):**  So I don't know if I'd say that it fits per se.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:13):**  Similarly, though, we struggle with this idea that there's ag tech and food tech and ag  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:21):**  food tech.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:22):**  And I actually think if we look at those bookends, that's actually a more fun discussion because  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:28):**  we don't often pay as much attention to how they should work in sync with one another.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:33):**  Yeah, I think the temptation is to split them up and say, oh, I look after the sector, you  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:39):**  look after this sector because VCs need to resource their team appropriately to dig into  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:43):**  different areas.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:44):**  But I guess, well, and this is what Benson Hill really does is kind of connecting the  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:48):**  two and thinking about how they can become more of the same thing and look at them together.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:53):**  Before we come to Benson Hill, do you like you were looking, I think, in life sciences  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:03:58):**  world a little bit at synthetic biology as well and some of the bleed over from approaches  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:03):**  in the life sciences area into ag.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:06):**  Any kind of lessons or examples of how that experience has helped you look at ag differently?  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:11):**  Yeah, I mean, that was really the impetus for me to get interested in this space.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:16):**  I would tell you that there's just when you come from that world and principally are focused  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:22):**  on human health care and then you look over into food and ag eight, 10, 12 years ago,  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:27):**  it's kind of deflating.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:30):**  I think it's, I'm going to use the word pathetic, how little investment and innovation was really  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:35):**  occurring in this area, which constitutes more than 5% of our global GDP.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:41):**  It's responsible for all the food that we eat.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:43):**  I mean, my goodness.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:46):**  Is there an opportunity space?  
**[0:04:48-0:04:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:49):**  I think you learned, I didn't come up in food and ag.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:04:51):**  I don't have a background in it, but you learn quickly that, again, a lot of those same enabling

**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:05:00):**  care 20 years ago.

**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:05:06):**  Frankly, it created, I think, and is still in many respects, a lot of opportunity for  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:05:12):**  innovative startups, entrepreneurs.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:05:15):**  Maybe one other thing that I'd add is that when the pharma industry is really getting  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:05:19):**  kicked off, and when I say farm, I mean like the ecosystem of life sciences and small companies,  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:05:25):**  entrepreneurs, and contract research organizations that were delivering innovation in the late  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:05:30):**  90s and early 2000s, it was in a larger respect catalyzed by the fact that all the really,

**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:06:41):**  I guess what was your shift like from the venture side to the operating side?  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:06:45):**  Yeah, well, I've never worked for a big company, so I've never had to endure that shift or  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:06:50):**  evolution.

**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:07:08):**  a lot of stuff, you never have to really live with your bad habits.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:07:13):**  It's like being a consultant and you go and you do stuff or work with folks to try to

**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:07:30):**  Jumping across to be an entrepreneur and to bring something to life, this all was catalyzed  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:07:36):**  by the fact that I was with what was previously a portfolio company and I got let go.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:07:41):**  I got canned.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:07:45):**  Two months later, I told my wife, who was pregnant with our first child at the time,

**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:02):**  Benson Hill was, of course, in its embryonic stage.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:06):**  I spoke with her about it and said, hopefully, honey, we can work on this thing.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:13):**  Six or eight months from now, we can get it funded and then I can get a paycheck.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:17):**  It was 37 months later, I brought home a paycheck.

**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:32):**  for not only just building, but building what we're building, which is obviously really  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:36):**  motivating.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:37):**  How did you even come across Benson Hill?  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:40):**  Were you part of the original idea or met the team or how did that all happen?  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:44):**  Yeah, I'm a co-founder.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:46):**  I'm not a scientist.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:48):**  I'm a generalist.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:49):**  I teamed up with some scientists who helped co-found the company.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:08:55):**  Really the thesis was we can utilize the computational knowledge.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:02):**  At the time, I don't think we were using terms like AI, but we can use computational biology  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:08):**  and the horsepower that these new analytical tools and machine learning could bring and  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:12):**  combine that with human intelligence and plant scientists and what have you.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:18):**  I call it the early convergence of data science and plant science, two of the three now pillars  
**[0:09:23-0:09:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:23):**  of combination at Benson Hill.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:25):**  We focused on sustainability traits.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:28):**  We've hatched this idea that, look, we can use the natural genetic diversity of plants.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:34):**  We can develop plants that can yield more by capturing sunlight more efficiently, converting  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:39):**  it to carbon more efficiently.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:42):**  And that was the first years of the company.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:44):**  And then a few years ago, we decided, look, a lot of the same infrastructure that we built  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:49):**  out, we call it CropOS, that's our technology platform short for crop operating system,  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:54):**  can be used for things like nutrition as well.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:09:57):**  And that was really a big leap for us because we were saying that we wanted to move beyond  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:02):**  the farm gate.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:03):**  We wanted to move beyond the farmer only model and ag inputs.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:08):**  And we wanted to go to a consumer model.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:11):**  And we felt like with a technology platform, we had the basis to transcend that, to connect  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:16):**  indeed the interests of the grower and the consumer.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:20):**  And that, frankly, is where I felt like we as a company really did hit our stride in  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:25):**  a lot of ways and have accelerated the business.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:29):**  Tell me a little bit more about that in detail.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:31):**  So like original business model, who is the customer?  
**[0:10:33-0:10:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:33):**  What did you do?  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:34):**  And then how did you think about changing and evolving that?  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:37):**  And where is it up to now?  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:39):**  So like in that initial model, your gateway to the market, the ag input market was really  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:43):**  a big seed company.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:45):**  So we were in dialogue with all the big seed companies and we're talking about co-developments  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:49):**  of traits and these kinds of things.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:51):**  But what you realize pretty quickly is that if you're not able to control your own destiny  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:10:57):**  to your own channel to that market, which in this case was really principally the farmer,  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:11:02):**  man, you could spend a lot of time and wait and probably participate in a pretty tiny  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:11:08):**  manner on the other side of it.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:11:10):**  And so the evolution was, OK, if we can use the technology platform to evolve past the  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:11:15):**  farm gate, we changed the dynamic of who cares, right?  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:11:19):**  Because now it's not just the farmer who cares, but the consumer.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:11:23):**  And that could be met through a consumer package, good company or an ingredient company or brand,  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:11:29):**  a quick service restaurant.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:11:30):**  I mean, you really open up a lot.

**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:12:46):**  And we get to the end and we're like, OK, how can we collaborate together?  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:12:49):**  And they sort of all looked around at each other and they looked at us and they were  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:12:53):**  like, look, we think this is really cool, but we buy ingredients and you guys are like

**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:13:05):**  And what I tell you that sort of because it just it brings to the top of your mind, like,

**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:13:17):**  I can't expect them to backward integrate to wherever it's comfortable for me.

**[0:13:28-0:13:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:13:28):**  just to go to our stakeholder base investors board and say, look, we've got to do the hard  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:13:35):**  work to innovate the business model to meet these kinds of organizations.

**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:13:45):**  of ideas that we're trying to put forward in the market.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:13:48):**  And we were, I mean, again, super fortunate to form capital around that.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:13:52):**  And now looking three or four years ahead since then to today, I mean, we're delivering  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:13:58):**  tens of millions of dollars of ingredient solutions to these kinds of companies and

**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:14:09):**  model innovation that's helped us bring that to life.

**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:14:22):**  Did that feel like, what was that like?  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:14:24):**  Was it like, oh shit, we're totally pivoting the business model.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:14:26):**  Are they going to be on board or was it like, oh wow, we've unlocked this whole new opportunity  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:14:30):**  and they're absolutely going to love it.

**[0:14:36-0:14:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:14:36):**  take venture capitalists who have a return profile, they need 30, 50% hurdle rates, return  
**[0:14:43-0:14:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:14:43):**  rates, and you say, I'm going to go purchase some lower margin asset because I think that,  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:14:51):**  I mean, and I'm going to spend your money to do it.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:14:54):**  I mean, there's a lot of like, what?  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:14:57):**  You're going to do what?

**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:15:06):**  I mean, like I said, I've never worked for a big company, right?  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:15:10):**  We needed to fill talent gaps to have folks who understood how to run a plant.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:15:16):**  We've built an organization principally around technologies and science development and that  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:15:21):**  kind of innovation.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:15:22):**  So yeah, it was an interesting evolution of dialogue that took a bit, but when we had  
**[0:15:31-0:15:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:15:31):**  some new financiers come to the table, they really, really, really embraced us as well.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:15:39):**  And as I think the collective group began to understand and truly appreciate that this  
**[0:15:45-0:15:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:15:45):**  is a fundable concept, but it creates an opportunity for us to become a really, really big company  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:15:53):**  over time.

**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:15:55):**  I mean, that is a leap, but that was a difficult moment in our evolution.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:16:01):**  I wouldn't call it a pivot.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:16:03):**  I'd call it a drastic evolution of our identity.

**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:17:23):**  you've now looked at pea?  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:17:25):**  How did you know that that industry was one to go after?  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:17:29):**  Yeah, that's a great question.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:17:31):**  So I mean, we predicted, I mean, this wasn't a prediction as much as it was an early indicator,  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:17:36):**  but beyond meat popularized in a lot of ways, yellow pea.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:17:40):**  If you'd asked me 10 years ago, what is yellow pea?  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:17:42):**  I would have said, I don't know, a yellow green pea.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:17:45):**  Like I don't know.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:17:47):**  So it became popularized and it like soy are the two of what are soon to be many drivers  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:17:58):**  of base protein ingredients for the alternative plant-based category.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:18:02):**  Now we're familiar, right, five, 10 years ago, more so with dairy and that obtained

**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:18:22):**  It's obviously more evident to us in the last 18 to 24 months given beyond, given the pandemic  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:18:28):**  actually accelerating those trends, given the fact that consumers will pay green premiums  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:18:34):**  now for these kinds of goods, whereas the data might not have supported that thesis  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:18:39):**  even five years ago.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:18:41):**  So I'd say we knew we wanted to get into nutrition.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:18:45):**  We knew we wanted to reach the consumer and this seemed like the most aggressively accelerating  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:18:52):**  category to begin placing a bet on, not to be the brand, right, but to be more, as we  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:18:57):**  like to say, this picks and shovels like the backend, so to say.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:02):**  And in plant-based protein, I imagine it's attractive as well because there's several  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:06):**  consumer facing attributes that you can start to impact like nutrition, maybe flavor, I  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:11):**  don't know, like requiring less flavor maskers or environmental properties around carbon  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:15):**  sequestration or making them easier to extrude.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:17):**  Like what kinds of consumer facing attributes are you targeting just to bring that to life?  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:22):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:23):**  So I'll be specific with like we call it UHP soy, ultra high protein soy, and it's really,  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:30):**  I'll call it, it's like a product platform.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:32):**  The idea here is you can increase the nutrition density in the bean itself so high that you  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:39):**  actually disintermediate some of the processing, the most expensive processing step that's  
**[0:19:43-0:19:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:43):**  required in between what today is a commodity, soybean and a soy protein concentrate, which  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:50):**  is the number one ingredient, for instance, in the Impossible Burger.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:53):**  So if you can ratchet up nutrition density such that you disintermediate that, it doesn't  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:19:58):**  necessarily mean that you're offering more protein in the immediate term, but you're  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:20:02):**  offering the same amount of protein, but you're ripping out a huge amount of the cost infrastructure  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:20:09):**  that's required to produce that ingredient and the carbon and the water that has to go  
**[0:20:14-0:20:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:20:14):**  into that, right?  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:20:16):**  Not to mention that because it's fully integrated and I can look all the way back to the field  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:20:20):**  from which these crops came, I can tell you, did this farmer use regenerative practices?  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:20:26):**  You know, what kind of applications did they use?  
**[0:20:29-0:20:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:20:29):**  And then over time, due to the point you made earlier, you have, we have databases of these  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:20:36):**  beans and we can understand their amino acid profiles, their flavor profiles, and we're  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:20:41):**  selecting for those things such that we can continuously improve upon them and screen

**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:20:51):**  doesn't get talked about very much at all, and that is affordability.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:20:55):**  The real magnificent unlock, I think, of this category, it's going to be, you know, can  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:02):**  I buy it?  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:04):**  And I mean by I, the proverbial mass market.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:07):**  If we cannot get a better cost profile to this stuff down to the consumer level, we're

**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:19):**  How do you balance that with the facts that we spend, you know, single digit percents  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:24):**  of income on food and to kind of truly move the needle, maybe we need to be actually paying  
**[0:21:30-0:21:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:30):**  more yet there is, you know, significant issues around food insecurity.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:33):**  Like at some point someone's sitting without a chair and the music stopped.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:36):**  I guess, how do you, how do those 10 to two facts sit with you?  
**[0:21:40-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:40):**  Yeah, we spend in the United States more just on diet related chronic disease per year than  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:47):**  we do on all food that we eat combined.

**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:52):**  I mean, I actually mentioned this to our farmer partners in the session last week as well.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:21:58):**  And I mean, you want to talk about ridiculous and we're so productive when we've done such  
**[0:22:03-0:22:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:03):**  a good job of producing these calories and you say like, look, we've created a system  
**[0:22:08-0:22:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:08):**  and deed of abundance.

**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:16):**  to really what is more importantly needs to be a dialogue around nutrition security or  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:22):**  insecurity.

**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:30):**  you know, to how we spend our income?  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:32):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:33):**  But there's a lot of folks who, you know, are spending everything that they can afford  
**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:37):**  to spend on food, and they're not being given the nutrition that they deserve.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:43):**  Right.

**[0:22:49-0:22:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:49):**  up in the system.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:50):**  But we've got to embrace the notions of how we've produced at scale, which is great, and  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:22:57):**  use that infrastructure at a lot of levels.

**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:25:47):**  How do you see this world changing the physical supply chains?

**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:26:09):**  chain to a national supply chain or even a regional supply chain as a goal to account

**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:26:25):**  Yeah.

**[0:26:32-0:26:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:26:32):**  know, in many respects, the system.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:26:35):**  That's a word that I actually love that word that gets thrown around a lot more recently.

**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:26:53):**  perspective is mostly a pain in the butt.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:26:55):**  Right.

**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:28:27):**  We don't want to change in any drastic way the practices because you create adoption  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:28:32):**  risk, what have you, it is a shift for some growers we work with to grow non GMO.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:28:37):**  So all the beans that we grow are non GMO, that requires, you know, a different kind  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:28:42):**  of practice.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:28:43):**  I mean, it requires more tension.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:28:45):**  It ultimately, you know, this is why the growers getting paid premiums to grow non GMO to begin  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:28:50):**  with.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:28:51):**  And we're working with them to identify varieties that, you know, that further enhance the pricing  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:28:56):**  premiums and the value creation potential of those of those crops.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:00):**  But I'll tell you, it's just an iterative cycle.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:02):**  And we're learning a lot from our from our farmer partners, we're expanding our network  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:06):**  factory more than doubled it since last year, and making sure that it's a dialogue, and  
**[0:29:12-0:29:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:12):**  that we're not just showing up and saying like, here's what it is we want you to do,  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:15):**  can you go do it, that I think has made all the difference.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:20):**  What's an example of that?  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:21):**  Like, what's what's something that you've been able to take on or listen to?  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:23):**  Because I think the I'm hopeful that the dialogue is moving towards Yes, we need early adopters  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:28):**  involved, yes, we need to think about ways to engage them, it has to be a two way conversation.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:32):**  But then as soon as they give you feedback about something that's not on your roadmap,  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:35):**  and you've got other pressures, like, it's easy to listen, but then hard to go actually  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:39):**  act on that.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:40):**  Yeah, well, I'll give you a specific example.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:43):**  So we've actually looked at how we can collect data from folks.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:47):**  And the growers, you know, over the last year, kind of come back and said, look, this, that  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:52):**  you're adding work for me here, like, I've already set up the set of systems that do  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:29:57):**  like 80% of what it is that you're talking to me about, can you help me figure out how  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:03):**  to make this more seamless.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:05):**  And so we did a bit of back to the drawing board, frankly, to understand what mechanism  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:10):**  would work best for them and provide the most convenience, but still provide the kind of  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:15):**  data that that we need and that we can think we can use to help them enhance their practices.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:20):**  I don't think we've landed that plane perfectly.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:23):**  But we've got a couple really, really strong pilots out this year, we got a couple really,  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:29):**  you know, some some early, I'll say feedback, that's just really positive about how we've  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:34):**  approached that problem and the systems that we've implemented.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:38):**  And it becomes this bit of a white glove kind of effect, right?  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:41):**  We weren't intending to resource that we chose to resource that because the growers said,  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:46):**  look, I need you to get more engaged with me on this topic.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:50):**  And it'll be a win win if we work together for several seasons.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:53):**  And we've chosen to do that.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:54):**  And I'm too early to tell, but I think that it'll pay dividends for both sides of the  
**[0:30:58-0:30:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:58):**  partnership.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:30:59):**  Yeah, I'm not surprised I was gonna ask about some of the underpinning digital infrastructure  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:03):**  to get the data on like what's working, all that stuff that you guys need.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:06):**  I'm not surprised you ran squarely into the interoperability challenge that everyone is  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:11):**  facing and that they don't want to enter data into a new system, even if they are getting  
**[0:31:15-0:31:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:15):**  premiums.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:16):**  How do you think about selecting farmers for that program, like you want people who are  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:20):**  gonna be giving you feedback, are willing to try new things, but also aren't so far  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:25):**  on the adoption curve that they're not representative of others?  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:29):**  Yeah, well, one good thing we have going for us here is that it's not like in order for  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:35):**  us to meet our business goals, we need to go plan on millions and millions of acres.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:39):**  It's really quality over quantity.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:41):**  So we went from 30,000 acres last year, 70,000 acres this year.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:46):**  And when we think about that relative to the 80 some million acres of soil that's planted  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:50):**  in the United States, it's not a whole lot, right?  
**[0:31:54-0:32:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:31:54):**  So I'm not trying to say we can be more selective, but I would say that we've been fortunate  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:01):**  to find growers who align very, very well with the values that we hold as a company  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:07):**  and who actually understand.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:09):**  Neither side is blowing any smoke here.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:11):**  We understand that there's a lot of value to be had to the extent that we can create  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:17):**  a very bilateral communication style and engagement.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:21):**  Fair enough.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:23):**  And what's in it for them?  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:24):**  Obviously there's premiums potentially on the line.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:26):**  How do you think about like incentives and what's in it for them?  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:30):**  So we pay growers a premium on every bushel that they can produce.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:36):**  And so we've got a portfolio of non-GMO lines, but we're essentially paying them for three  
**[0:32:41-0:32:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:41):**  things.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:42):**  Number one, we're paying them for identity preservation, right?  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:46):**  Meaning they've got to keep it segregated from whatever other commodities that they've  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:51):**  got going on.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:52):**  Number two, we're paying them for the non-GMO, right?  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:55):**  Because it may indeed require more attention.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:32:59):**  And then lastly, as we're paying them some kind of premium for whatever it is that is  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:03):**  the type of crop that's being produced and if it's related to protein content, if it's  
**[0:33:07-0:33:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:07):**  related to some specialty trade.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:10):**  So those are the inputs that essentially define incentives that we can offer.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:17):**  What's the journey been like for you and going from four or five of you to 350, kind of moving  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:22):**  maybe what I'd categorize from founder to CEO?  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:26):**  Well, it's been a heck of a learning curve.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:30):**  And I like to sometimes say, I've never been in a job in my life that I was qualified to

**[0:33:35-0:33:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:35):**  I'm certainly maintaining that pattern.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:37):**  But one thing I really believe in, and I saw examples of this early in my career and I've  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:44):**  just tried to emulate it is be curious.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:48):**  I ask a lot of questions and sometimes people think I'm asking questions because I secretly  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:54):**  know the answer, but like 99% of the time I'm just asking because I want to know the  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:33:58):**  answer.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:00):**  And what it engenders, I think, is some degree of trust, especially in the people that you  
**[0:34:05-0:34:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:05):**  can surround yourself with who are a heck of a lot smarter than you and who bring these  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:08):**  kinds of experiences, which is what I also like to ask a lot of questions about is how  
**[0:34:12-0:34:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:12):**  do things work and how they worked in the past and what hasn't worked.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:16):**  And the other thing I'd tell you is that in my experience, and someone actually came up  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:20):**  recently with a better way to put this, but it was called like the art of tripling.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:24):**  So when you're three people and then you're roughly 10, let's just say 10, and then 30  
**[0:34:30-0:34:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:30):**  and then 90 or 100, and then 300, in my experience, that is a really, really good indicator of  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:38):**  sort of the cultural inflections you endure as a company.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:42):**  When you're 30 people, everybody in the company can know everything that's going on.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:46):**  Everyone knows everybody.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:48):**  When you're 100 people, you can't do that.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:50):**  And it's really hard to grow up.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:52):**  If you came from being 10 people to now you're 100, right?  
**[0:34:55-0:34:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:55):**  That's a really big difference.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:34:57):**  And then 300, now you're like in the system process world.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:00):**  So those are things that fortunately I've had some good coaches and supporters who have  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:08):**  helped me think through that and keep me, I wouldn't say all the time, but a lot of  
**[0:35:13-0:35:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:13):**  times keep me out of the ditch.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:16):**  The way I've heard that explained is every time you triple, everything breaks.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:19):**  So like be ready for it, which it sounds like.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:22):**  That's a much more eloquent way.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:24):**  Yeah, that's a much more eloquent way of putting it.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:26):**  I don't know.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:27):**  The theory of tripling sounds nice.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:28):**  It's a bit more positive than that.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:30):**  Everything breaks.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:31):**  I want to come all the way back though to kind of investment models as we wrap up here.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:34):**  You guys have just announced the SPAC.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:37):**  I guess I don't know how you'd phrase it, intention or success or path or what we had  
**[0:35:41-0:35:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:41):**  to tell me a little bit about that decision.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:43):**  And I guess any broader comments on the kind of SPAC model, especially for ag tech?  
**[0:35:50-0:35:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:50):**  Well, ag tech and food tech, agri-food tech, let's say again, not the most common area  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:35:57):**  for investment, not an incredibly well understood area, frankly.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:03):**  So what a SPAC does that helps that is it allows you to disclose information to prospective  
**[0:36:10-0:36:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:10):**  partners and investors in sort of a behind the curtain mode.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:14):**  You can bring them in and share much more detailed, confidential, medium term, even  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:21):**  long term information and walk them through in a lot of depth, the substantiation of that.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:27):**  You could have them engage with people under confidentiality that if you were just going  
**[0:36:33-0:36:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:33):**  public through a traditional IPO, you can't do that.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:36):**  And this is a tough category, in my opinion, for companies to build trust quickly because  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:43):**  the models are not super simple.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:45):**  It's super simple if I have a consumer good or widget or a mousetrap or whatever, and  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:49):**  I'm just going to sell it and I'm going to sell this many or this many at this margin  
**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:53):**  or that margin.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:55):**  It's a pretty linear way of thinking and it's easily adjustable by Wall Street.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:36:59):**  When you're saying I've got a closed loop, two sided business model with farmer engagement  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:37:04):**  and this portfolio of products and crop innovation at the core of it, like it's kind of complicated.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:37:10):**  And so I actually have enjoyed the SPAC IPO process because we've been able to bring folks  
**[0:37:19-0:37:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:37:19):**  who've just done a tremendous amount of diligence and unpacked all these layers of things and  
**[0:37:24-0:37:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:37:24):**  then in turn helped us tell the market the compelling components of the story in a way  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:37:31):**  that that's led to a successful pipe, which we upsized and was oversubscribed.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:37:36):**  And in that case, it sits beside the SPAC that together pulled the potential to bring  
**[0:37:42-0:37:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:37:42):**  hundreds of millions of dollars of proceeds into the company.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:37:45):**  And so we signed the definitive merger agreement in May and we expect to close and be public  
**[0:37:51-0:37:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:37:51):**  this quarter.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:37:52):**  So it's a really exciting time to accelerate the business.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:37:56):**  It's interesting you talk about that in almost the opposite way I expected, where when people  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:00):**  are sort of criticizing the SPAC model, they say, oh, well, if a company goes public at  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:05):**  this kind of early stage when they are really complex, how do they kind of keep that stream  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:10):**  of information going to keep Wall Street happy versus just private markets where the investors  
**[0:38:14-0:38:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:14):**  can take that time and can do that diligence?  
**[0:38:17-0:38:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:17):**  But I guess that's more comparing like SPAC to raising venture versus SPAC to traditional  
**[0:38:21-0:38:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:21):**  IPO.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:22):**  So I guess you've sort of turned what I might have perceived as a negative into a positive.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:27):**  Any comments on why go down this path versus raise another round and continue private?  
**[0:38:32-0:38:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:32):**  Yeah, so when we actually knew, not knew, but we anticipated over a year or well over  
**[0:38:39-0:38:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:39):**  a year ago, it's been now a year and a half, that the public markets were probably an appropriate  
**[0:38:45-0:38:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:45):**  place for Benson Hill to end up.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:47):**  We began doing some pre IPO readiness or I'll call it public market readiness planning with  
**[0:38:53-0:38:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:53):**  an outside consultant who helped us sort of inventory the things that we would need to  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:38:57):**  be doing on a roadmap over the course of the next one to three years.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:39:02):**  So when last year, you know, the SPAC market piped up and which I mean, if you had asked  
**[0:39:07-0:39:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:39:07):**  me 18 months ago, what a SPAC is, I wouldn't have been able to answer the question.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/24/designing-crops-to-change-the-plant-based-food-system#t=0:39:10):**  But when it became what is now more popular to go public by a SPAC than it is a traditional

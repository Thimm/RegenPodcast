### Agtech - So What?  (2021-01-11)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the AgVenti Group.  I'm Sarah Nolet.  Increasingly, meat, especially red meat, is being positioned as the bad guy when it comes  to climate change, the environment, and health.  And there are some loud voices in this debate, on both sides.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:00:21):**  If a sustainable food system is the end goal, how helpful is this debate, and are we focusing  on the right things?  We have these incredibly passionate, extreme views about finding alternative protein options.  And largely, the way that they promote or push their case is to denigrate the red meat  sector.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:00:45):**  And a bigger issue is how do we actually feed the world?  That's Jason Strong, the Managing Director of Meat and Livestock Australia.  The MLA is a big industry player.  It's a producer-owned company that spends about $270 million a year on marketing, market  access, and research and development for Aussie cattle, lamb, and goat producers.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:01:08):**  While most Australians will know the MLA for its annual Summer Lamb campaign, featuring  the larger-than-life former footballer Sam Kekovic, its messaging has had to become a  lot more sophisticated recently, as communications technologies advance, and food issues, and  meat in particular, are becoming increasingly susceptible to emotional debates and even  misinformation.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:01:31):**  For example, there's a battle raging over food labeling, what can and cannot be called  meat.  Today, we're hearing from the red meat industry, what they're doing to become carbon-neutral  and why, and efforts to continue to maintain their social license.  Let's meet Jason, who has pretty much always been involved in the meat industry.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:01:50):**  I can't remember not being in it.  As far back as I can remember, growing up on a farm at Gunnedah and then going to an  ag boarding school in Tamworth at Faro, always wanting to be a cattle producer, always wanting  to be a farmer, always wanting to be involved in the industry.  It started way back, and I think this commitment to being a cattle farmer has been the underlying  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:02:14):**  theme, but obviously, I'm off on a bit of a tangent, although I have been down that  track and still do some of that.  The big shift for me, though, was I think at an early age, learning from others and  being very willing and excited about what others were prepared to share.  Most of my learning and significant learning has come from other people in the industry  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:02:38):**  and those that I've been very fortunate to spend time with.  Very early on, I did a lot of livestock judging, and turns out I was pretty good at it as a  young guy, and I won a trip to the US.  That was the real critical tipping point for me.  I was part of the Angus Youth Program.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:02:56):**  I used to have a national Angus show on sale at Albury-Wodonga, and I won the judging competition  there which got me a trip to the University of Illinois for a semester.  That was the real defining moment in my career for a number of things around travel, around  confidence, around seeing reward for effort, because that was the second time I'd been  in the national final.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:03:19):**  I came second the year before, so you learn about picking yourself up and responding again.  Probably more important, I learned and met some of the most critical and defining things  and people in my career in that four-month period.  Some were very best friends, but also an educator called Dr. Tom Carr, who was the meat science  professor at the University of Illinois.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:03:43):**  He was very, very helpful and supportive of me wanting to learn, and that's when I started  to learn about the meat grading system and got a bit more excited about what else might  be able to be done in the industry and came back to Australia and then got back on a bit  of a different path where I came back very excited about being a meat grader, thinking  that that was going to be my new career path to discover we didn't have a meat grading  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:04:05):**  system, which is very career limiting if the thing you've decided to do doesn't actually  exist.  Back on this theme of the important people, I called my old Ag teacher, Greg Chapel, who's  a very well-known Angus breeder at Glen Ennis now, and said, Chaps, I've decided what I  want to do.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:04:24):**  I want to be a meat grader.  He said, well, unfortunately, we don't have a meat grading system.  I was like, well, let's set one up.  That's what actually got me started then on the path.  Collectively, we started working on setting up the MSA program, which is Meat Standards  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:04:37):**  Australia as we know it today.  I'm sure you know where many of the skeletons in red meat are buried, but also some of the  great stories around how Australian red meat has evolved to become a global powerhouse  in the space.  One of the things, given you've had lots of different kinds of experience in the industry,  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:04:53):**  and obviously where you sit at MLA, you're seeing a lot of the shifts in how red meat  is being viewed globally and from inside and outside of Australia, to your point about  travel.  What are some of the big things that strike you about how the perception of red meat has  been changing over your career in the industry?  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:05:13):**  It's really interesting how we've seen it change.  It's not just, I think, the perception of red meat globally, but it's also, I think,  how the Australian industry has responded to that.  Some of it's been in parallel, some of it's been as a result of the changes, but some  of it's been a path that Australia has been on anyway.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:05:32):**  In Australia, we're seeing a very bias and one extreme view about red meat.  I think it comes back to our position as a country about how privileged we are and how  fantastic we have it here.  We have a massive amount of choice and discussions about alternative protein sources and what  else you might be able to do as far as food choice goes.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:05:56):**  That's a privilege that the majority of the world actually doesn't have.  We're seeing more interest in other protein sources, but more importantly, I think we're  seeing the significant increase in demand for protein.  As the world becomes more affluent and the protein demand increases, which is one of  the first things that happens when people become more affluent is they go to more secure  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:06:15):**  protein sources and particularly red meat.  So we're seeing an increase in demand for protein across the board and we're seeing  an increase in demand for red meat proteins as well.  But we're also seeing in the last 10 or 15 years, an increase in the availability of  information and communication and there's a lot less filters on what information comes  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:06:37):**  out and people are able to take very strong, largely uninformed or poorly informed or informed  with bias positions on things.  So I think we're caught up in all of that.  So we shouldn't be naive about the challenge.  We shouldn't be naive about the opponents to red meat, but also we, on the other hand,  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:06:58):**  we should be very positive and excited about the opportunity for the growth in protein  demand.  It's really interesting what you're saying about who has a voice nowadays.  It used to be that there were big trusted institutions and what they said goes and the  famous campaigns around things like Got Milk in the US and these were trusted institutions  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:07:21):**  that people listened to and that was what was sound nutritionally, environmentally,  et cetera.  So there's this mass ability to communicate whoever you are on the internet and to have  a Twitter handle or whatever and get your views out there and go viral and have a perspective.  How are you seeing that influence the red meat industry?  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:07:38):**  I guess I imagine in both positive and negative ways.  I think sadly it's probably more negative than anything else because there's an industry  globally where we're not managing that very well and that there's a bunch of us trying  hard to do that.  We're not projecting our voice and our message outward well enough yet.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:08:00):**  We're having a lot of very robust discussions with ourselves and the most common thing I  think that gets asked in the meat industry is what's somebody else that I know doing  about this rather than what can I actually do about it.  If we could just project ourselves outwards, I think we'd see a material change.  More broadly I think what we're seeing though is some of it creates fear and concern and  
**[0:08:24-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:08:24):**  unnecessary worry for people when things are purported to be a lot bigger issue or a lot  more of an issue than what they necessarily might be.  Climate change is one where I believe we all should be very conscious of how we manage  our impact on the environment and how we invest in improving the environment going forward.  But I'm not a subscriber to the world ending and sadly that is a lot of where this argument  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:08:53):**  comes from and we see that so often which is terrible because what it does then is just  polarise people so we end up with the supporters of that saying, oh no the world's going to  end and then the opponent saying, oh no nothing's actually going to happen you shouldn't listen  to any of it and neither of these people are right.  We've got to find this sensible middle ground and sadly what happens I think with the availability  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:09:17):**  and speed of communication and information these days is the loudest extreme voices seem  to be the ones that are heard and they manage to find each other and fight and the majority  of us that sit in the middle of that we've got a responsibility to try and find the solution  and get our way forward before the loonies on either extreme wreck the joint for us.  Of course climate change is having an impact on the environment and society and agriculture  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:09:49):**  has a significant carbon footprint but ag can also be part of the solution.  The Australian red meat industry is now moving towards a target of being carbon neutral by  2030.  This commitment announced in 2017 is a proactive stance to address emissions largely by investing  in technologies from genetics to husbandry but not promoting regulation.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:10:12):**  And it was really ambitious at the time and got a whole bunch of commentary but it was  incredibly insightful now in hindsight where it was a position that was taken from we have  evidence which says there's challenges around the broader environmental future and we know  that agriculture is highly reliant on the environment and we know that there are components  of the red meat sector which contributes to that and here's a path for us to be able to  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:10:42):**  get in front of that.  So let's actually set up the plan to get there.  Now as it turns out incredibly proactive and insightful but also a world leading position  for an industry to be positive and proactive about that.  Sadly you know so much of the discussion in the vein of this wild communication gets right  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:11:04):**  off track from that.  Yeah how would you say meat has been positioned and it sounds like you don't necessarily think  that's fair.  I really don't think it's fair.  No I think I think meat and particularly cattle are a real scapegoat for people becoming more  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:11:20):**  aware of a potential impact on the environment and so we know that the red meat sector has  an impact on the environment and there's people in our sector that will say no it doesn't  we have no impact you know but we do right so all of us have an impact on the environment  you know you get up and put your pants on you've had an impact on the environment but  it's nothing like what gets reported so often so we know for example the red meat sector  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:11:42):**  contributes about 10% of greenhouse gas emissions and I think what often happens is when we  think about something that can be done and I think the climate discussion is a good example  where it's very easy for people to agree that something should be done it's much harder  for them to agree that they specifically should do something and the poor old cow is one of  the best examples so everybody knows what a cow is very few people in the total world  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:12:11):**  population actually own one so it's very easy for them to say oh I recognise what a cow  is but if something's changed about the cows that's probably not going to necessarily impact  me at a personal level so let's actually use the cows as a way to make a solution.  Meanwhile those of us that are up to our neck in the cow industry are being more proactive  than anybody else about trying to find a solution so yes I think it's incredibly unfair the  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:12:39):**  way it's being positioned particularly given how proactive the industry is in a whole range  of areas and how much progress has been made since 2005 in Australia you know we've halved  the impact of the red meat sector on the global on the national greenhouse gas emissions inventory.  What are some of the ways that's happened and some of the ways that that might continue  to keep happening one of the pushbacks I hear is well some of that is from just de-stocking  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:13:07):**  and a lot of that stock will come back in years of drought and things like that so what  what's your sense of how that what's been successful and what is the future hold in  terms of areas for potential to keep reducing that impact?  I think what you just raised there Sarah is an incredibly important part of this discussion  and and what we see so often and you know let's use other analogies it's a bit like  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:13:28):**  when you've got sales staff and you say why haven't you hit your numbers let's say it's  phasing you know it's these one line throwaways that try and get us in front of or get us  past something which we're not necessarily comfortable with ourselves there's a small  component of truth in so many of those things that get said but the reason why the bigger  reason why the reduction in contributions to the inventory have happened since 2005  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:13:53):**  is around land clearing management so land clearing hasn't stopped but is being managed  better so we've actually we've had a greening of the cattle production areas since 2005  compared to prior to that and that creates some issues we've got to be able to manage  regrowth we've got to be able to manage productivity it's also increasing in productivity so shorter  turn off time so more kilos produced in a shorter period of time and some of it is is  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:14:21):**  around the the herd inventory but it's a whole combination of things which have contributed  to that and most importantly there's no point having a carbon neutral goal if we aren't  still productive and profitable and we have intergenerational sustainability because we've  got to feed the world and regardless of what anybody might think whether you're a vegan  or a veggie or you're an extreme meat eater we've got to have a way to have balanced eyes  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:14:50):**  we've got to have a way to to feed the world and there is there is actually no known solution  now to replacing the protein that's provided by the by the red meat sector and as well  as that sector being custodians of such a large chunk of the of the land and if you  don't actually manage it properly and well and livestock's not the best ways to do that  that's going to create bigger problems as well so now the cows are pretty important  
**[0:15:18-0:15:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:15:18):**  part of the future.  It strikes me even in how you talked about climate change before that there's still a  lot of sensitivities around this and my I guess sense is that producers worry about  something like a carbon neutral target as oh there's going to be regulations imposed  on me I'm going to be told what I can and can't do and people who don't understand farming  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:15:40):**  are going to threaten my profitability intergenerational sustainability etc.  What's your response is this a threat and something like a carbon neutral target or  and or an opportunity?  So firstly I think it's absolutely an opportunity but I absolutely understand those concerns  as well and those concerns are very real if we don't get in front of it ourselves and  
**[0:16:04-0:16:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:16:04):**  if we aren't a strong voice and if we aren't proactive about demonstrating that that we've  got this that we actually have a solution for productivity and profitability for intergenerational  sustainability for leaving the environment a better place being part of the climate solution  then we absolutely run the risk of of things being imposed on us which may not necessarily  make sense or may not necessarily be scientifically based but that's not what will be driving  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:16:33):**  them will be people wanting to feel better about themselves and respond to other concerns  and one of our biggest problems from a MLA point of view and a broader industry point  of view is the proactive steps that we're making being connected to the potential for  regulation and and the two things are very very different and we've got to keep absolutely  keep being away at our communication to make sure that we're very very clear that our our  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:17:07):**  focus is on finding this three-prong solution where we're driving we're being driven by  increasing productivity and productivity and production and profitability so I think this  proactive piece is absolutely our our best offense.  And even even over this period I mean there are obviously naysayers there are big challenges  that need to be overcome for all of agriculture including red meat one of the challenges in  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:17:31):**  particular for red meat as you've highlighted is sort of the the loud voices around livestock  as a culprit in in the climate conversation yet the prices of red meat have skyrocketed  over at least the recent times you know what what does that say to you about the anti red  meat sentiment?  I think it's a loud minority but it's also a big a big threat and you know a lot of the  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:17:55):**  statements that get made about the the red meat industry and about a whole bunch of other  things are frankly just made up and they're delivered to support a self-interested or  biased view of the world yet they get an incredible amount of space or traction whatever.  What's an example like is there a particular one that comes to mind?  The one that keeps that keeps popping up is it is about sustainability and about sustainable  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:18:22):**  diets the best thing you can do for a sustainable diet is actually less red meat which is absolute  rubbish you know like it's actually there's actually nothing to support that like there's  there's no peer-reviewed scientific-based evidence that says that is actually a solution  around diets it's but we have the same issue around health so there's a there's a lot of  association studies which people then talk about as scientific studies but there's very

**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:19:19):**  I hear the nutrition argument that one feels muddier because correlation and causation  you know that there's been studies recently around red meat causing cancer but to your  point if you're eating red meat are you also eating cheeseburgers and coca-colas and having  a milkshake you know and we understand so little about the human body so I think to  me there's there's weak signals but we don't have an answer there and anyone that says  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:19:41):**  if you just eat this or if you just don't eat this you know that's not how human bodies  work on the environmental side though I mean we talked before about 10% of Australia's  national greenhouse gas footprint comes from red meat that one feels a little harder to  say that reducing red meat consumption is in like won't have any impact given that data  so how do you think about the evidence there versus some of those conversations?  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:20:06):**  Well I think a couple of things that are important about that is that the the information attached  to the alternative isn't also then included so if you go to something like our world in  data which is one of those consolidating data points and they have total animal agriculture  impact on the environment at less than 10% so whether it's 8%, 10%, 12% counts but it's  around those numbers it's certainly not 20 or 40 or 80 which gets run out so many times  
**[0:20:33-0:20:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:20:33):**  but in that same set of information the total greenhouse gas emissions from cropping is  actually greater than animal agriculture you take in cropping you take deforestation associated  with cropping and crop burning and it's actually greater than the impact of animal agriculture  so yes we know that the red meat sector has a contribution to the inventory but if we  then start looking at what does the alternate contribute as well like well hold on if we're  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:21:05):**  going to replace these calories with calories that come from this which we know is going  to take a significant increase in the production it's going to actually mean land use that  hasn't been previously used for cropping and so far evidence says that it's not appropriate  for cropping so you try and do a one-for-one swap and we have no concept of what the increased  impacts concern.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:21:30):**  The truth is it's really complex.  Jason's right in that it's not a one-for-one.  Land is cleared for both meat production and cropping but it takes more land for meat to  be produced than it does peas or tofu.  Studies show that livestock takes up to nearly 80% of global agricultural land but produces  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:21:47):**  less than 20% of the world's supply of calories and yet in Australia in particular there's  a lot of land that can't really be used for cropping but is suitable for grazing.  Undeniably what we eat and how we farm are incredibly important when it comes to land  use.  How do we actually find a holistic solution to being able to feed the world, being able  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:22:09):**  to run our businesses on an intergenerational sustainable basis and being able to leave  the environment in better shape but instead we have these incredibly passionate extreme  views about finding alternative protein options and largely the way that they promote or push  their case is to denigrate the red meat sector and a bigger issue is how do we actually feed  the world?  
**[0:22:37-0:22:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:22:37):**  So it's very hard to not get past self-interest is actually driving these discussions and  I think the most concerning bit is that that doesn't get called out enough.  Yeah it strikes me that that's true on both sides like you see farmers posting saying  you know we've got to push back on the alternative proteins and you see alternative protein people  saying oh we've got to you know not have all the cows and I guess where I get to is the  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:23:03):**  systems change you know what can we do at scale and how do we actually get to a sustainable  protein source which gets to carbon neutral and some of the goals that MLA has set and  is kind of moving towards we think technology is a big solution there but some farmers will  adopt technology some farmers will be advanced in these practices and others won't or won't  think that change makes sense for them.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:23:25):**  How do we get to that systems change and is regulation inevitable or is it innovation?  What actually moves the needle?  So I don't think it regulation is inevitable but it may be but it comes back to our opportunity  you know we do have a window where we can actually be proactive and and as I say innovate  our way through this next phase and we've got to take a broader industry view so I don't  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:23:51):**  think we're going to get agreement enterprise by enterprise because as you say we do have  extreme views on on both sides and the extremes neither of them are right you know the extreme  on the anti-meat side they're not right and the extreme on the meat side they're not right  either so I have a very a very strong view that the bigger issue is feeding the world  and in some ways the manufactured plant-based proteins are just another protein and yes  
**[0:24:21-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:24:21):**  they're a competitor to red meat and at a simple competition level there's other things  that are competitors to red meat as well and we should be conscious of that we should make  sure we position ourselves well and focus on our positives the unique selling compositions  that we have that drive 96% of households consistently eating beef and 76% or 8% of  households consistently eating lamb so at a simple competition level there's ways we  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:24:52):**  can deal with the stuff I have a problem with is when any opposition doesn't matter whether  it's a manufactured plant-based protein or another source of protein or whatever it might  be dishonestly or misleadingly denigrates our product without any attempt whatsoever  to promote their own and if we're actually about feeding the world then let's work it  out to feed the world but if people want to like I say dishonestly or misleadingly denigrate  
**[0:25:18-0:25:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:25:18):**  our product just so they can try and create a bit more position for their own which we've  got heaps of examples of and I've got no interest in having anything to do with them and we  absolutely should fight back and push back on what they're doing and saying because they're  being dishonest and they're misrepresenting their position.  It strikes me that the space is getting heated and one of the results of that is we're adding  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:25:42):**  more adjectives to how we describe things which is sometimes amusing even what you just  said is like manufactured plant-based proteins like now we're gonna add manufactured in front  of it but like ground beef is manufactured too and like so we're in some ways making  this more confusing when I tend to agree that data is pretty strong on we need sustainable  protein and there's a massive opportunity to start moving in that direction no matter  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:26:05):**  how that protein is sourced because we need efficient feed conversion ratios, we need  sustainable diets, we need profitable farms, good use of land, etc. etc.  Again kind of coming back to the technology I guess one of the areas that is talked about  is carbon farming or carbon sequestration through livestock and actually there was a  recent announcement that you would have seen around some producers in Australia selling  
**[0:26:31-0:26:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:26:31):**  carbon credits in a private deal.  Stu Austin was on the podcast as was Matt at Cavization and then the scientific communities  really pushed back and said oh you know we're not really there yet we're not sure if this  soil carbon is being sequestered.  What's your view is this an area for solutions and technology and does this kind of hold  
**[0:26:48-0:26:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:26:48):**  hope for Aussie farmers?  I think it's absolutely a great opportunity and definitely one of the solutions and now  it's interesting isn't it your comment about some of the scientific community responses  and that'll be funnier later on you know when we look back and see what some of those responses  are but because if you just think about it well it's so two things right so the amount  
**[0:27:14-0:27:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:27:14):**  of commentary that came out after the announcement of the sale of those carbon credits to Microsoft  by Wilmont with absolutely no knowledge about what they've done was really quite amazing  because what they've done is a really robust and comprehensive process of measuring over  time what their positioning was and you look at the interventions that they've done and  the things they've implemented in managing their livestock and land and a whole range  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:27:39):**  of things that makes an incredible amount of sense where they ended up.  But the immediate responses on the negative side related to I haven't seen this or I don't  understand this yet or what I've done hasn't gone down that path so that can't be right  which is pretty amazing really because when you actually go and sit there and dig into  it I think what they're demonstrating is a fantastic opportunity.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:28:05):**  When you look at the process Wilmont went through particularly but others as well they  started from drought resilience how do we be more drought resilient and they got to  a point and say well far out look at what else is happening now that we're doing those  things and the things that we're actually putting in place look at all these other unintended  consequences which are really positive impacts on our land let's also start focusing on those  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:28:28):**  as well so then they end up with this drought resilience production and profitability and  natural capital enhancement approach and one of the things they measured was soil carbon  and were able to demonstrate over a reasonably short period of time the ability to not just  increase but increase and maintain those increases in soil carbon.  So it's fantastic news so forget the selling carbon credits there's a whole bunch of other  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:28:56):**  stuff that relates to soil carbon which we know so anybody who wants to jump in and say  well we're not sure about whether this is possible so hold on just go back to your basic  soil science remember one of the things that contributes to increased water holding capacity  and gives you greater utilisation of the rain that falls on your land is by increasing your  soil carbon how did you do that before?  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:29:17):**  Increasing organic matter how did you increase organic matter before?  Increased ground cover hold on let's just use a whole bunch of different words that  you recognise from soil science and forget we're talking about soil carbon sequestration  to measure the units and potentially sell them and you've been teaching this stuff for  decades.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:29:35):**  What are some of the other approaches or technologies that excite you that might solve some of the  challenges around perception or actual environmental impact of red meat?  So I think there's some knock-ons from that so when we look at the soil carbon piece which  is reasonably late to the game because there's been a lot of other discussions in the last  three or four years and this has been one this is quite contentious the soil carbon's  
**[0:29:58-0:30:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:29:58):**  been been quite contentious but increased productivity so getting more productivity  from the size of the herd or the flock sooner is certainly a big opportunity for us so you  know reducing age of turn-off increasing kilos turned off by time in the livestock sector  in the cattle sector particularly seeing the increase in turn-off through feedlots for  example we're reducing the age of turn-off and increasing the carcass weight those sorts  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:30:26):**  of things and then on the supplement side so obviously things like Rhetosparagopsis the  seaweed supplement has been very well published and those things are very real being able  to reduce the production of methane for animals that are being fed those supplements by more  than 90% with no detrimental impact on productivity in some places increase in productivity.  There's a lot riding on it like we've got challenges around market access for you know  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:30:56):**  meat and other agricultural products that have certain credentials we've got livelihoods  at stake we've got perceptions I think as we the technology advances we're going to  have more evidence like we'll have satellite imagery that shows how much biomass really  was or wasn't there and we'll know how much carbon was there so yeah and that that has  its own opportunities and challenges but I guess ultimately it comes back in many ways  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:31:17):**  to perceptions and to how people are feeling and talking about this and there are some  big naysayers how's MLA thinking about kind of countering some of the negative views of  the red meat industry?  I think we've just got to keep chipping away at it Sarah but it's got to be incremental  we've got to be careful not to get too distracted by things that pop up in a short media cycle  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:31:42):**  or otherwise some of the market access stuff is really interesting where the potential  for environmental adjustments or environmental requirements for market access or entry into  certain markets have been kicked around and we saw a case earlier this year where there  was a mention of those potential constraints in some of the European trade and it was just  a mention so it was mentioned in the European Parliament but no detail, no structure, no  
**[0:32:16-0:32:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:32:16):**  implementation, time plan or process but the conversation very quickly progressed to and  this will be an issue with our free trade agreement or this is going to restrict our  access to the market and it's like no it won't it will absolutely have what they're talking  about will have no impact on that whatsoever should we be aware of this absolutely but  hold on we're more advanced on this than anybody else in the world so rather than jumping up  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:32:43):**  and down and trying to make it harder for ourselves why don't we just turn around and  say that's an interesting concept that you have look at what we're already doing and  an example I use often was when I was in Europe 10 years ago I was involved in a discussion  with the FAO around environmental requirements and it was with a subset of the group there  that was talking about potential environmental standards or sorry welfare standards welfare  
**[0:33:11-0:33:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:33:11):**  standards and what would Australia's appetite be for these standards which of course your  radar goes up and thinks my goodness you know the Europeans imposing things like this is  going to be a disaster well so rather than jumping to that conclusion I said well what  did you have in mind and said well the things we were thinking about were were days outside  and days off concrete well I think our industry will be very concerned about that but if that's  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:33:44):**  the path you head down we'll have to consider whether or not we can comply you know now  if I had to ask that second question and just jump straight into there's no way we're going  to agree to European welfare standards being imposed on us whereas what they're actually  thinking we'd have a hundred percent compliance with so part of what we have to do is just  not overreact to these things as much as we can keep control of the path that we want  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:34:15):**  to be on.  And the MLA can be very good at controlling the media narrative in fact it does it every  year with its summer lamb campaign which coincides with Australia Day last year's advertisement  won awards it was beautifully shot funny and a very well-timed political commentary on  the repeated state lockdowns happening in Australia due to COVID-19.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:34:36):**  Here's a snippet for you it's set in a dystopian future 10 years from now where there are physical  walls between the states and it's the smell of lamb that makes the people start breaking  the walls down.  I love the smell of lamb in the morning.  Sorry for trying to become our own country again.

This is all of us.  It could be argued that the ad did its job.  It was viewed over 10 million times on YouTube played across all major media outlets in Australia  
**[0:35:44-0:35:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:35:44):**  and lamb sales went up.  But does it address any of those broader perception issues?  So our targets for the ad are kind of everybody.  And last year it was one of those just perfect environments where the team put an idea together  which they start now.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:36:02):**  So there was an idea that developed over six months and it was just one of those ones that  just got better and better and better the closer we got and even in the weeks leading  up to the ad out the the putting the ad out the the premiers were making decisions and  statements which it seemed like they're actually on our side it was it was like the ad agency  must have been prompting themselves are really helpful if you know you guys could be really

So that was obviously a fantastic campaign that worked well and but the whole point behind  that is is the messaging and it's the people's awareness of lamb and the idea of lamb bringing  bringing people together and the idea was incredibly effective this this last year but  as you say there's those underlying requirements as well so the messaging that then sits behind  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:36:47):**  that so the things at point of sale the articles that go into the retail magazines the social  media the the other you know bringing to life of the the campaign touches on all of those  other things around nutrition and around you know the quality of the product and the versatility  of it and and you know how how much is loved by Australians that the the campaign and particularly  this one last year it certainly was was enduring that's for sure.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:37:15):**  Yeah I had lots of good conversations about oh does the rest of the world really think  about how many states we have and how ridiculous that can be at sometimes and yes that yes  that is how some of the world sees that.  It struck me though because in Australia I when I left I was walking to the ferry to  go to the airport and there's a big lamb ad on the side and then I landed in San Francisco  
**[0:37:35-0:37:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:37:35):**  and got off the plane and there's a big Beyond Burger Beyond Meat burger side and I said  oh well you know we're in a different country now and you know Silicon Valley especially  worth where some of these things are from one of the things on some of those ads here  is is meat and the conversation the US has moved I would say mostly beyond labeling we're  not sort of talking about that as much in the US as I think that still is topical in  
**[0:37:57-0:38:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:37:57):**  Australia what's your view on alternative protein products branding themselves as meat?  I think that that argument's obviously still raging here in Australia and I think I've  shifted I was not that excited about it but not all that bothered by it and I think it's  largely and I've shifted some time ago that if we are if we all were genuinely in this  together about feeding the world I think it'd be a different discussion the challenge of  
**[0:38:32-0:38:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:38:32):**  this you know unreasonable untrue self-interested denigration of our industry to try and promote  another and that's just not on it doesn't matter what you're doing I mean that's just  it's just unacceptable behavior and if that's the case then we don't want anybody who acts  like that or anything that acts like that to be called the same thing as us and we sure  as heck don't want our consumers to mistake them as being the same and that's really what  
**[0:39:05-0:39:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:39:05):**  drives my view on it and I'm not sure we can come back from that in Australia.  What do you say to the argument that consumers aren't really confused you know they're not  confused that peanut butter is butter and so you know they're not confused about this  either?  So it's actually not true there is some study there's some work being done right now and  
**[0:39:24-0:39:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:39:24):**  we've seen the preliminary results of it which says that consumers are confused so that'll  be part of the Senate inquiry and that's again it's a good example I think of putting objective  information behind it.  As Jason mentioned there's currently a Senate inquiry in Australia into food labeling which  threatens to stop plant-based products using words like meat steak or sausage in naming  
**[0:39:50-0:39:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:39:50):**  their products.  France is one country which has already taken this stance.  As you can imagine it's a very heated debate.  On the one side the meat industry is arguing that it's confusing for consumers and that  plant-based products are unfairly using the meat industry's good reputation.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:40:05):**  Those on the plant-based side strongly disagree.  They cite studies suggesting consumers know exactly what they're buying, aren't confused,  and actively want to buy plant-based products.  We've linked some of the research in the show notes so you can make up your own mind and  tell us what we've missed.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:40:21):**  As for the future the plant-based protein industry is expected to grow and there are  strong indications that plant-based diets will become more popular.  There's also strong evidence that demand for protein of all kinds is growing and that ultimately  we need our protein to be produced sustainably.  Australia remains one of the top three beef exporters in the world and Jason is very optimistic

And in the last two or three decades they've invested in being a consistent producer of  high quality protein and the investments that have gone into traceability, eating quality,  quality assurance, free trade agreements has now positioned the industry incredibly well  and we've got very good prices now and then that's partly due to the big global macro

But a big part of it is also the investments that the industry has made across the board  on being a producer of very consistent high quality in demand, fantastic protein.  So part of what we've got to do is stop being surprised by our success because this is the  plan.

So it's how we now build on that and keep all of our fantastic customers happy with  the prices they've got to pay for our product now.  Fantastic.

Thank you for listening and thank you to our listeners who suggested on our recent survey  that we should have MLA on the podcast.  We know this is a polarizing topic, so we've worked hard to provide lots of resources to  the work mentioned in this podcast on our website, agtechsowhat.com.

**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:23:37):**  you know we do have a window where we can actually be proactive and and as I say innovate  
**[0:23:43-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:23:43):**  our way through this next phase and we've got to take a broader industry view so I don't

**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/8/10/misinformation-carbon-neutrality-red-meat#t=0:24:04):**  on the anti-meat side they're not right and the extreme on the meat side they're not right

### Agtech - So What?  (2018-18-10)
**[0:00:00-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly changing  the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting started.  But there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between ag and  ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring you the  story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where ag and tech  
**[0:00:44-0:00:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:00:44):**  meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast.  Today my guest is Carl Lippert. Carl is a dairy farmer and a ag tech founder and maybe  one of the only people who has a degree in dairy science and computer science. And Carl  is building a ag tech company called Feedex that is a wrap up of a product he's been building  for a while called FeedManager. And he has been selected to pitch at the Farmers Business  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:01:23):**  Network Farmer to Farmer Conference here coming up very soon. So really exciting time to be  talking to Carl about the future of Feedex and talking to him about technology adoption  more broadly and what he's seen in Europe and in the US and what it's like to be one  of the people that really understands the industry building a product as opposed to  a tech person building product from the outside. Someone who is both deeply immersed in computer  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:01:49):**  science and writing software and building products as well as really knows the ins and  outs of what it's like to run a dairy farm. I love this conversation with Carl and I hope  you do too.  Hey Carl welcome to the podcast. Thanks for joining us.  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:02:11):**  So where in the world are you today?  I am in Fargo, North Dakota. So you know a little ways from home but Fargo.  I've heard a bit about Fargo as a little kind of ag tech hub. Is there is there kind of  ag tech stuff going on there or what what what brings you there as well?  Yeah yeah that's exactly why I'm here. So there happens to be you know a growing kind  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:02:36):**  of cluster here I would say because I got to tell you I never thought I'd say oh I'm  excited to go to Fargo and that's actually that's actually the truth. And so yeah there's  there's emerging prairie which is like building an autonomous farm. There's just a couple  companies in the area. It's definitely growing yeah.  Interesting I would not have expected that either but in the last year I've probably  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:03:01):**  heard three or four people mention ag tech things happening in Fargo and so now it's  yeah surprisingly on my list of places to go in the near term it sounds like.  So tell me so so you said you're there for ag tech stuff as well. What what are you doing  there? Tell me about that.  So in a few days in the middle of next week the main thing is a cultivate conference so  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:03:27):**  it's kind of like a it's like a one day super fast kind of like a TEDx type thing for ag  technology. So basically they're really trying to you know build out the network and so they're  inviting lots of farmers lots of people that are building ag technology. Just anyone interested  in the space kind of like to build this network in Fargo and it's all pushed by emerging prairie  which is basically you know I guess it's kind of a regional development group as far as  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:03:51):**  I can describe it but you know it has because of their location a really strong focus on  ag tech and so their biggest thing is like I slightly mentioned before this this autonomous  farm and kind of accelerator stuff they're trying to build going forward. They're just  just getting started with like they just hired a guy named Brian recently to start really  pushing this. So it's all very new but it's definitely happening.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:04:19):**  And so are you going there as excuse me as a farmer as a technology builder as a onlooker  what's what how come you're in town?  I guess I'm here as a technology builder but I am always still a producer so I get to be  on all the lists because I get to be on the farmer list and I get to be on the technologist  list but I'm definitely here to be a technologist so I'm here to speak about FedEx and what  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:04:44):**  we're building and you know who our customers are and how we can help dairy farmers.  Cool. So tell me a little bit about FedEx and I tried to find the website so you have  to send me the URL or maybe there isn't one but yeah tell me about FedEx and yeah kind  of the backstory like why did you decide to start building building technology and specifically  building this technology?  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:05:08):**  Yes let's learn it so oh we're in stealth no we're not in stealth but we are we actually  yeah for the website yeah you can find it. So well yeah so I'll tell you why so basically  so a little backstory feed manager is the name of the the product I've been working  on for a couple years and building on my farm and there's a guy named Ryan who is my co-founder  in in feedex so the company that like owns no feed manager is now just a product of feedex  
**[0:05:40-0:05:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:05:40):**  because we're working on a whole set of problems but anyways he was building a marketplace  for feed up in New York I was building software for helping dairy farmers feed their cows  in Wisconsin we both had kind of like same long-term vision so we came together with  it it's called feedex so feedex we might have had a little bit too much of let's say musky  and kool-aid so it's definitely yeah that that's definitely that kind of part of the  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:06:04):**  naming but it's short for feedex it's short of per feed exchange which is like the rebranding  for how he was selling feed in New York and so yeah you can't find feedex yet because  we came up with the name like a month ago and we haven't finished all the rebranding  of the products and stuff to give it a home you know we own the URL but it's nothing nothing's  there yet so you shouldn't have been able to find it okay good well that makes me feel  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:06:31):**  better I did find feed manager and then I got all excited to download the app but then  I couldn't download the app so it's been a tease trying to find to dig into this stuff  but but go back for me Carl and tell me about why because feed manager looks pretty well  designed and built and there's some real stuff there so take me back to why did you decide  to start building an app for for feed yeah so I mean I've been talking to you about a  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:07:00):**  lot last few days so really I guess it comes down to like 2013 I think I basically started  decided to start building it I had gone and done an internship for the largest software  company in the dairy management space we'll say they've been around forever you know they're  translated in like five language or something they're huge I didn't see a lot of improvement  happening there and that really kind of bummed me out and then I did like an internship or  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:07:26):**  I mean I did a study abroad researching like seed tech adoption and all this stuff and  I realized that like nothing was happening fast enough and I guess I probably had fed  too many cows as a kid and kind of like dreamed about you know fully automating it or something  like that so that's probably some of the context but so well yeah I started building let me  stop you there I want to know about the tech adoption so you you studied that like specifically  
**[0:07:51-0:07:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:07:51):**  tech adoption overseas tell me about that yeah so you know I never knew going to college  does he do a study abroad necessarily well my brother did one and he worked just stuck  in France the whole time and so he's like you should really really try to find something  that you love to do and find a way to come into school to let you not be in one place  for it the whole time I'm like okay so I took the advice and I ran with it so basically  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:08:18):**  I set up an independent research project which in reality is hey write 90 pages on what you  did and described to us why it's educational and for the college and yes I did what was  the evaluation of technology adoption and feeding systems in Europe to compare it against  in the US specifically around near infrared technology which is just you know it's a it's  not a new technology but it's a way that we measure like the quality of seed and how we  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:08:45):**  do rations formulation and stuff in the industry yeah and so yeah I just traveled you know  I I asked anyone I could anyone that has sister company in the US I'd get like you know warm  intro and I just went to a whole bunch of farms in Germany Eastern Germany is so different  than say the rest of Europe worked on some farms milking Normandy cows like an inorganic  context in France so just all over as many farms like to go to there and just kind of  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:09:13):**  looking at what they were doing compared what we were doing and it was a hugely different  market you know they're very subsidized or well supply management they had a quota at  the time so you know learned a whole bunch about you know the the larger aspects of technology  adoption the economics like large-scale industry economics that you know either push adoption  or reduce it because margins exist or they don't or you know in Germany they were paying  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:09:38):**  like almost a hundred percent for people to put in robots so like they had robots like  crazy so yeah all of that that was that was super cool wow so I know this is an oversimplification  and living in Australia I get asked questions like which country is winning and and that  always seems kind of silly but I'm curious is there a trend like is are there certain  countries that are just clearly way ahead in terms of technology in this space than  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:10:04):**  others or is it more does it vary by farm size or by production system who how would  you kind of characterize who's most likely to be adopting technology well I'm gonna take  that question maybe spin it a little bit when it comes to winning I mean the purpose of  technology is to solve a poll so I would I would definitely say that you know here in  the United States because a lack of supply management you know a huge density in a long-term  
**[0:10:32-0:10:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:10:32):**  you know agricultural history we really you know I really think we set the bar really  high for what you know being efficient high quality producer of agriculture products is  but that doesn't mean we have like the highest level of technology adoption in maybe a more  physical sense like we have lots of you know how we manage things the whole organization's  built inside of the United States are you know super impressive whereas over in say  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:11:04):**  Europe where they have had for long term and you know Canada still supply management yes  they've had more margins because they've had a guaranteed milk price and I'm just talking  with dairy the most that it's the best I know the most about it but so they have a lot more  like let's say what most people consider as like tech adoption you know they have physical  products on their farm robots you know Germany leads the world in like methane digesters  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:11:27):**  for green electricity off of you know waste from dairy farms like they definitely you  over there they have a lot more automation and a lot more actual physical tech products  adopted and that's just because the economics have been different and the price of labor  is drastically more and you know how the government has supported them to do these things like  having a good market for green energy for methane digesters so you know there's not  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:11:54):**  a win I would say we have the most efficient agricultural system here in the United States  which is the goal of the technology you know the most sustainable sufficient system but  there are more actual physical products penetrated into the market and say like Europe yep no  I think that's I mean it's a really helpful clarification and definitely appreciate you  putting me in my place there I think yeah I definitely meant that you answered that  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:12:21):**  really well I'm always interested because I do think people talk about tech adoption  as like it's better to have more tech and just as you said that's not necessarily true  like in some cases it is in some cases it is it isn't and it's all about kind of the  fraction efficiency and quality and sustainability and bottom line so yeah really interesting  I've been thinking about tech adoption a lot recently and the market factors just play  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:12:47):**  so much of a role like are there subsidies for these kinds of systems or is our labor  prices high or do we have a surplus of working capital because of a price so we can invest  in kind of trying things for a while so I think it's a really interesting and fascinating  space did you see anything anywhere on your travels that you were like we need to get  this on the farm like we should do this or buy this or anything that you kind of changed  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:13:12):**  because of what you saw well you know there's lots of things I saw that I was totally amazed  by because a whole different word like you know eastern Germany wasn't always you know  a democracy like it is today there's a time in its history where it was had a different  government and you know they built really large farms just to suit the needs of people  and so yeah like I want a hundred percent automated feeding systems you know my dream  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:13:44):**  is that farmers can have automation to the level where maybe they have an improvement  in life quality all right and so in eastern Germany they have like a hundred percent automated  feeding systems for thousands of cows so these are super large scale dairies but these were  built in like I don't know the 60s or 70s like a very long time ago and they did it  in a style similar like mining so it's really big and ugly and high infrastructure costs  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:14:11):**  but yeah like I definitely was jealous because all you need is push one button and they're  doing a very efficient job maybe not capital efficient but implementation efficient job  of feeding thousands of animals automatically in a very complex fashion and I do want to  bring that really to every person that feeds animals across the world and until we can  make it profitable and simple and reduce like the infrastructure cost of implementing it  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:14:39):**  that's not going to happen so that's kind of a long-term thing is to get to that level  of automation.  Yep interesting I'll be really interested to see kind of how that evolves and I imagine  that's shaped your thinking like that kind of seeing the potential of the technology  did that kind of spur you to build some of it or were you kind of always on the path  
**[0:15:00-0:15:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:15:00):**  like you studied computer science as I understand it so were you always on the path to kind  of build some technology or did those travels help you say like I gotta take this into my  own hands and actually start making some of these changes myself?  Yeah you know like the lack of progress like I mentioned before a little bit you know if  I saw anything as a child like maybe this lesson is backfiring for my family a little  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:15:25):**  bit but the concept of not waiting for anything like you know you can't wait for someone else  to solve your problems you know don't wait for you know just anything you know that's  a very nice rule you can use in small situations big situations life context so not waiting  for someone to solve your problems and you know we definitely have these problems in  my dairy farm right like so I'm solving problems for myself the not waiting context and actually  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:15:49):**  the biggest way to describe it probably is I try to like weigh what I do based on creation  versus consumption is kind of the two buckets I live in and I'm a huge consumer of technology  and I just you know I'm just like ravenous I use it all I spend too much money on early  adopter products and so I'm huge consumer of technology and so I kind of like to balance  it out and I couldn't be this excited about technology and not be part of the creation  
**[0:16:16-0:16:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:16:16):**  of it so I think it always is gonna happen I can't say exactly when you know I was I  didn't have like the lemonade stand necessarily like gonna build a business when I was a kid  but I definitely was like that don't throw away the computer I want to pull it apart  and see how it works even though I couldn't put it back together because like I completely  destroyed it pulling it apart yeah yeah so I think I think that answers that yeah yeah  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:16:40):**  definitely um you said a few things there that I want to ask you about so at some point  here I'm gonna ask your favorite technology product so you can get ready for that for  that question I'm interested in why like do you think it's true more generally in agriculture  that some of the big companies that have been building technology whether it's herd management  systems or some of the bigger hardware systems are like not going to be able to innovate  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:17:06):**  in a way that someone like yourself who's studied computer science and wants to build  apps and is a you know grew up pulling apart computers like is is it that the big companies  can't do it and we're seeing that kind of traditional disruption and tech startups are  going to come in or is there something about agriculture that's different like do you think  it's kind of the same as every other industry that big companies are going to be slow and  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:17:29):**  not be able to innovate and startups are going to come in or yeah is there something different  about ag and I guess the other piece of that that you mentioned is kind of scratching your  own itch which I love and I you know do you think that gives you an advantage because  you really know the problems or maybe a disadvantage because you're you run the risk of just solving  for your own like the problems on your own farm versus something that you know thousands  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:17:52):**  of users would want yeah those are those are two kind of things I'd love for you to reflect  on man that is like five really big questions probably so I'll try to so kind of the answer  is a little bit of all of it so you know I do I always I always wanted many people to  be trying things as possible as one so like I believe that like just as an industry or  whatever it's best if we kind of are running in all directions all at once sometimes like  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:18:23):**  we can make sure that we're not focusing on the right things by trying lots of different  ideas so that includes you know finding ways for more startups to exist more medium-sized  legacy businesses to maybe get in technology this includes you know the large corporates  the multinationals you know building innovation pipeline so in that case they're mostly you  know outsourcing their innovation and buying it so we need all these things to happen because  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:18:49):**  we truly just have a problem with total number of things being tried you know it's massively  ramped up or let's say the last five years but I think we're nowhere in your penetration  because of how large and how you know worldwide obviously the agricultural market is I think  you know I am maybe I've read too much dystopian fiction or maybe just because I am a small  company working with you know at the farmer working with only big fish you know John Deere  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:19:15):**  big companies that you know I can't ever pretend to have a have leverage against in an argument  or in a business environment I definitely believe that we are going to see some of these  really big long-standing companies not be able to move it so definitely disruptive I  guess I've been mostly vocal about on the internet about like John Deere specifically  because I think you know the momentum of just having a company like John Deere where they  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:19:43):**  build you know really complex you know super awesome actually physical products the momentum  of like that product line and that organization over the years and how much they do is going  to be why they have trouble you know navigating say swarm robotics stuff like small robot  co in the UK or like dot up in Canada all these companies are building fully autonomous  tablets more swarm like robotics I think they're gonna have a real big problem you know mapping  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:20:13):**  themselves to the new reality kind of like you might you might go compare it to like  Tesla to Ford or something like building everything in-house and having a full integration to  create awesome products versus you know having thousands and thousands of people in your  supply chain that all just kind of pack things together so you're gonna see the disruption  I guess I hope I'm moving on to like on the second part of the question I hope you know  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:20:38):**  like yeah the optimism in me is saying that yeah I'm more suited to do this because I  have a you know practical sense of what farmers need and I have a very practical mindset because  you only do things that you know you only do mission critical things on farms you know  we don't sit around depending on how many consultants we want to hire or you know things  that aren't gonna solve problems right now you know there's not affordable so I hope  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:21:08):**  that helps me but I definitely you know am aware that hey especially when it comes to  say working and kind of startup life you know how much can I integrate say the business  model of taking on financing you know which is something that's super important to do  you know make things move fast to improve the technology faster but if you spend in  my case like 28 years living in a low margin industry that you know takes all capital as  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:21:39):**  debt and cash flow is king like can you move to you know can I internalize and functionally  manage the oh take on a bunch of money to hire people and actually not be profitable  in a sense for you know 10 years maybe right so it does that does worry me that may you  know I have hoped that my egg context is useful for building things but I do understand that  there's risks involved with it yeah are there any parts of that question I didn't I forget  
**[0:22:08-0:22:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:22:08):**  no I have a disease of asking complex questions I do that all the time and it's not very helpful  especially for for guests on a podcast so sorry about that and well done you get an  a plus for answering all parts of the question is your co-founder also kind of from the AG  industry or does he come more from the tech side oh he's definitely from the egg industry  so I'm I would be what you know they would call me the technical co-founder because I  
**[0:22:37-0:22:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:22:37):**  know how to write code people seem to think that's magic or something but no so he is  nutritionist historically so he actually was he wasn't raised at a farm necessarily but  he started getting farm jobs when he was younger got really into it even though his family  thought it was a bad idea to get an egg because they're like yeah you know eggs not a very  simplistic money but he was just excited about it so he ended up being like a consultant  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:23:02):**  nutritionist he managed a few dairies so you know he has you know an amazing set of skills  related you know what dairy cows need you know what the feed industry works like you  know I work with feed vendors and I buy feed and I make feed and all these things on the  farm side and he really has a really excellent you know say mental model built around you  know how the distribution channels work you know where the where the margins exist you  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:23:28):**  know where there's opportunities to help farmers where there's opportunities to help vendors  how we can really make the whole feed supply chain and the way commerce works around animal  agriculture works better yeah so that's I mean I love it I love the ambition of the  vision and I love the domain expertise I see as I'm sure you do lots of ag companies that  don't have the ag expertise that don't have that deep sense of how the industry works  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:23:54):**  and what the problems are so I think that's really cool and exciting how given all the  stuff you want to take on there and are taking on how have you figured out kind of where  to start because especially marketplaces are tough like you need both sides and there's  a bunch of different things that people will want to exchange like how did you figure out  what to build first or where to start and yeah kind of what is that what are you going  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:24:18):**  to market with first yeah so I can answer we're going to market with first we have  the basics of the seed marketplace up and running and we have the the you know the app  the fee manager application that you will be able to download very shortly we raked  it back for a month just to do a migration on the back end and we were dispersed with  a handful of like alpha and beta farmers so that's why you can't download it but anyways  
**[0:24:41-0:24:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:24:41):**  I wouldn't have been very useful to give you any feedback anyways yeah yeah exactly and  I think that the ongoing experience is better done in person at the moment but anyways so  you know I have to say the answer is we haven't figured it all out right we have a whole lot  of ideas that need to be tested out we're working you know very very hard and trying  to nail it down better this year we are going to have a strong focus on building products  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:25:12):**  for vendors so there's we think there's lots of opportunity left like it seems you know  the running joke like if you look at movies that come with Hollywood it's like don't get  into commodities like it's a giant waste of time there's no margins it's basically just  moving things around and everyone acting like maybe occasionally they make money but when  it comes to say like logistics and contracting and how kind of more holistically the industry  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:25:38):**  works how feed gets replaced place how it's purchased who purchases it spot orders versus  contracting bag feeds versus bulk feeds where it gets mixed you know this whole thing we  think that we have a lot of opportunity to help vendors improve how their operations  work and so we're actually really focusing on you know we have we have a dairy fiber  product and we want we have we have the seed management software we want so we can roll  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:26:08):**  that on the park right now so we'll still be doing this we're really focusing on building  software for vendors and for farmers and that's kind of the way we're looking at building  up and network a little bit finding opportunities for both of them like actually their front  offices and their in-house processes maybe you've heard of open table they have this  phrase I've heard the news before it was come to the tools stay for the network and we're  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:26:32):**  definitely kind of going down that path right now and but the real the real answer is we  don't know we we don't know the best way to do this yeah really interesting and love love  how you're thinking about it it's it's really cool to talk to people who like get the like  I said kind of get the industry so deeply but speak in tech lingo like I think you're  rare were you rare in your like in in studying computer science but also having a degree  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:27:01):**  in dairy science like where you were there a lot of comp sci kids in in your college  degree that also came from the ag side of things and do you do you work with a lot of  people who are kind of straddling both of these worlds or are you rare in that sense  oh I've always been a very individual human being would probably have my family would  my family would put it yeah no when I went into computer science even though like I did  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:27:28):**  it in Wisconsin at a fairly local college like these people are all familiar with AG  just because the density in my state but yeah no I was obviously the only one from a farm  or had worked on farms you know when I did that so yeah I guess the answer is just like  you put it I've always been different cool I love it and are your parents supportive  of you like going down this path and building technology or were they rather you spend more  
**[0:27:55-0:28:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:27:55):**  time on the farm what's their view on all this yeah so I mean you know yeah my family  is supportive even if like it is a bit messy so you know I am a part owner in our family  farm I've been helping run it full-time for the last five years since I left River Falls  forgot my dairy science degree I like to joke that the problem was raising strong independent  ambitious children is that you have to live with them and so they can have it they can  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:28:26):**  have to deal with that side effect that that's how they raised both me and my brother so  you know yeah they're supportive you know they're excited about it but when it comes  to the practical implementation of that you know it it's not always great that yeah I'm  in Fargo and you know we're we're trying to combine soybeans right now and that's kind  of part of my domain that I have historically managing on the farm so you know migrating  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:28:47):**  in all senses is difficult so they're supportive but on the practical sense all farm decisions  are made on a hundred year time scale so it's hard to to steer sometimes yeah sure it's  I wonder too about the kind of different like I think farms are good examples of agile in  the sense of you try something and then you change it if it doesn't work but you do that  over many years and and that's kind of the time scale in which things change whereas  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:29:15):**  something like software is changing on the order of you know days or weeks as you're  testing and learning things do you see that parallel or is that kind of a naive parallel  to draw that that there is this kind of sense of try and see what works and then fix it  in both of those worlds yeah I mean I think I think like any organization like the the  big pivots I don't think we can do big pivots as fast as maybe an organization that's outside  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:29:43):**  of egg but there's always little little iterations going out at all times like let's say how  you feed your calves or some ingredient you feed your cows or how your your reproductive  management works in in your dairy herd both things like we we can test those things out  try new things and the scale is usually months but it comes to say a new way of producing  let's say becoming an organic farmer I mean that takes four or five years let's say you  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:30:10):**  wanted to start a value-added supply chain by going straight to consumer that takes years  and years right and capital and years and years is to get to the starting line not to  get the finish line so you know there is an iteration cycle is slower when it comes to  on-farm practices and like hope for people building egg tech products that are they're  fast to adopt maybe a little barrier to entry products like those things can those things  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:30:35):**  can happen fast yeah yeah interesting so tell me about where you're at with feed  techs you're obviously speaking about it this weekend some information is public and more  soon are you guys gonna like are you raising money are you building out the team are you  like kind of what's the status of the company and what are the next kind of milestones you're  hoping to hit yes I mean yeah I'm talking about it this week that'll be really easy  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:31:00):**  because I mean it's eight minutes and it's not it's not it's not for money but so yeah  we are focused really on figuring out what we think is best for exactly what we're building  what funding needs to look like see how we're definitely looking for funding but we're kind  of still we're lucky enough to got picked to pitch to the 3,000 farmer members of farmers  business network in December so really focused on executing that doing that well you know  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:31:30):**  having the best version of all of our live demos ready for that and then we're thinking  all right you know that'll be kind of like the end of the holiday season it might be  easier to start working on it then and we'll have you know neither of us have ever raised  money before you know we haven't done that so definitely you know we're planning on raising  money starting soon but figuring out exactly what that looks like in a practical sense  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:31:55):**  implementing it what our valuation is how much we're asking for and and how that affects  our decision making forward is something we're trying to figure out in the next like month  here yeah lots to juggle but congratulations on the FBN thing that's gonna be really exciting  and are you nervous like do you get nervous to speak on stage are you nervous even just  for the for this week and for that event will you are you do you love doing it or yeah how  
**[0:32:22-0:32:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:32:22):**  does that make you feel you know I always try to do things I'm scared of and I'm definitely  scared so I don't yeah I get I definitely a shaky when I do public speaking but I'm  hoping that you know more iterations I'm less scared so I've done some public speaking like  it's not the end of the world I'm not I'm not worried about fainting or anything like  that but I'm definitely a little nervous you know it's a big audience and it's something  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:32:49):**  I care about more than maybe anything I've spoke about before so there's a little bit  of pressure but I'm excited yeah awesome I feel the same way I get nervous for sure and  especially when you care about it you get more nervous even though it should I think  I'm always like why don't I like talking about this or why aren't I better at talking about  this because I care so much and it's like well I probably am better but because I care  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:33:10):**  I get more nervous and maybe that makes it worse I don't know and then go around the  spiral of worrying about that instead of just getting out there and doing it so I'm sure  you'll be great will your talk be public I'd love to link to it in the in the episode and  definitely check it out will it be available somewhere so the one from Fargo I'm actually  not sure if they if they record them I was actually thinking of recording myself just  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:33:32):**  like it he's a person training material for for December so if it's available we'll get  you a link so I can be in the show notes cool love it awesome Carl well super exciting I  I'm really looking forward to hearing kind of how all of this evolves it sounds like  you have a big like do you imagine that FedEx and is your goal to have it become like a  big tech company that is that you're working on full time and you know has thousands of  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:34:00):**  users and many employees or do you see it kind of staying small with a small team like  what's what's the end state that you're you're hoping for if you get to pick yeah so we we  definitely are going big on this one cool do you feel like go ahead sorry no I was just  saying I guess I was what I was saying is like for from building like the farmer-based  software on my farm you know for years and years I guess I guess really why we've decided  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:34:32):**  it to go big with it is when you sit down and actually ask yourself like you know ground  truth questions like if you're sitting there for years writing software not getting too  far you just keep asking yourself like how can I help like how can I actually help this  user how can I actually help this farmer and when it comes down to it when you're in software  like well actually the biggest the biggest problem is you know some of the existing maybe  
**[0:34:58-0:35:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:34:58):**  market dynamics or lack of transparency stuff like that that we can't solve by basically  just writing applications that help people you know manage the on-farm management and  efficacy so that it has to be a big solution for a big problem how fun very exciting I  am one of our guests that came on last year I think Doug Fitch from ag world he had I  forget if he said it on the podcast or not but I know I've heard him say it before that  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:35:30):**  there's kind of only going to be three businesses in the future and one of those is going to  be logistics like no matter how the world changes we're still going to need to move  stuff from A to B and so companies that are helping to do that better and solve that problem  and make those connections are are going to exist and do well in the world and it sounds  like you guys are targeting that space which I think will be a good one to be in I tend  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:35:52):**  to agree with that do you imagine expanding outside of just dairy and doing other kinds  of livestock like do you know what that next that next market would be yeah well definitely  so we you know we're you know we are kind of branded as dairy at the moment but we're  definitely you know animal agriculture has a core set of problems that are very similar  certain industry stacks are different poultry and swine are just a very different place  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:36:17):**  to live in the production type of difference we're focusing on all animal agriculture we're  starting with dairy because we've known the most about it but actually like already part  of kind of bootstrapping this company since we don't have any funding is just people have  been asking to buy feed from the marketplace that doesn't say exists so we like would go  and find it and find a price we can get them for it and actually fulfill the order so we've  
**[0:36:42-0:36:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:36:42):**  we've already you know done stuff outside of dairy over last year selling on the marketplace  kind of you know being a vendor ourselves to kind of bootstraps the network and to kind  of create some cash flows to actually be in business so yeah we're going outside of dairy  what that looks like and how that evolves you know depends on the the level of opportunity  and just who wants to be involved cool what have you learned so far in doing this like  
**[0:37:14-0:37:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:37:14):**  what surprised you about building a tech company that that you maybe didn't didn't expect I  would say I have a great great appreciation that most farmers might miss out on on people  that are say knowledge workers there's a popular idea in in farming that say like oh if you  don't say milk your own cows or do physical repetitive tasks for a living that you're  not really working and I got to tell you I can be more exhausted and have more like actual  
**[0:37:47-0:37:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:37:47):**  physical ailments from say programming for a week then I can't farming sometimes so you  know just you know understanding how hard all work is and building software is hard  even if it's you know completely in the world of bits it is a demanding difficult task and  it can take a very long time and when something like say a button is a little bit leggy you  might not understand but that that might be a two-week project right so I have a great  
**[0:38:19-0:38:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:38:19):**  appreciation for building things and how difficult that can be that's so funny my the one all-nighter  I pulled in college was definitely on a computer science assignment and it was probably because  some button didn't click or something and I have just been there so frustrated and physically  exhausted when software doesn't work so I I hear you it's funny my so my boyfriend works  in sales and he I used to think like he would just have meetings all day and and he'd come  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:38:46):**  home and I'd be like what you know you didn't you didn't build anything today like you how  are you really working you didn't like get anything done and he's like yeah I was like  selling stuff and had meetings and I was managing people and and I was sort of like but you  didn't create anything like where's your the thing you made and now that I have to work  in sales and like have lots of meetings and manage people I'm like oh this is exhausting  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:39:10):**  like I really need to apologize to him because I thought that unless you were making something  even if it was knowledge or you know code or writing that you know it wasn't real work  and it's definitely real work so I love that coming to appreciate how hard something is  once you've done it and from the outside it seems like it's way easy and it's it's totally  not yeah and I've been I've been trying to the the word I've been using is I'm trying  
**[0:39:35-0:39:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:39:35):**  to move from programming to people right now because I have what I consider a foundational  layer built but all my problems right now are about you know resourcing up finding people  to be involved finding people that might be a key hire finding people that you know have  been dying this for ages and want want to want to help make the movement so building  you know a movement or building an organization those are real tangible things albeit non-physical  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:40:03):**  right so yeah what um what kind of people are you looking for like are you hiring developers  or other co-founders like what's who are you looking for next to build out the team so  yeah I mean we so yeah a bit of everything so we're definitely for developers and you  know you mentioned before you know we have no I'm actually very excited to have say another  couple developers that have no egg context because you know it does you know level out  
**[0:40:34-0:40:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:40:34):**  the team a bit you know you don't have to be historically a farmer and that would be  the most impossible thing to solve for finding oh we want programmers from dairy farms like  yeah good luck so so you know people that have you know long term have seen that there  are you know there's a lot of people that work that don't say maybe love how their job  works or you know there's just lots of big problems that we never had a solution to so  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:41:05):**  we're looking for people that are like nutritionists or consultants people inside of the industry  that have you know themselves seen change but had the opportunity to make it so we're  looking for people on both sides of the board and a lot of that will be happening early  next year very early next year very exciting well I will keep my eyes out for anyone that  I think would be a good fit I did say and this will be my last question maybe for you  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:41:30):**  Carl that I would ask about your favorite technology product that you use so what's  your yeah like if you had to pick your it's funny like I got asked this question when  I was interviewing this was I don't know 10 years ago for various product management jobs  it would be like one of those you know Google or Microsoft interview questions of like what's  your favorite piece of technology and then dissect it and then explain it to a two-year-old  
**[0:41:52-0:41:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:41:52):**  and so I won't go that in depth for you about what's your what's your favorite piece of  technology or favorite product that you use or have used yeah gosh that is I gotta tell  you that it's super super difficult because there's so many ways you can judge a product  don't worry it's not an interview yeah yeah I know well you know oddly enough like I'm  gonna go straight straight nerd like I was a Google Glass Explorer like I paid 1,500  
**[0:42:27-0:42:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:42:27):**  bucks to develop a kit and I wore it even though it's super socially awkward for like  six months nine months and I actually broke a pair and had to get another pair luckily  I'd have to pay for that but I I can't stop buying space for and computing devices because  I do really believe in that future where you know like I don't have to look at you know  when my phone buzzes and I have to dig it out of my pocket like that gets so old especially  
**[0:42:52-0:42:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:42:52):**  farming I'm almost 30 like covered in grease or like I have both hands loaded but like  yet I know I'm like on ambulatory service like 15 employees sometimes right it's not  like they're dying but like they need help instantly kind of thing sometimes so yeah  like Google Glass was actually really awesome you know even though the implementation was  kludgy and there was major problems with it but face face form computers yeah I'm kind  
**[0:43:15-0:43:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:43:15):**  of jacked that is the best answer ever and I'm imagining it's funny there's all those  ads of I think John Deere has some and others of like the future farmer and they're like  you they've got some kind of face computer and you know a tablet or a touchscreen in  the air somewhere and they're you know running the farm off of virtual reality and the whole  thing but you are the first prototype of that with Google Glass on the dairy farm I'm giggling  
**[0:43:41-0:43:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:43:41):**  imagining you out there doing that was it did it work like were you did you find a use  case with the Google Glass that you liked you were like oh this is better than if I  didn't have it or still too early well the biggest thing is like I mean it's definitely  too early I used it it was super awesome as a communication device and like for things  off-bar like driving like amazing for navigation just having like a slightly translucent map  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:44:09):**  of what you're doing just kind of like taking up five percent of your like point of view  I was excellent and you know if I would have maybe spent a bunch of time doing superfluous  superfluous things I want to get difference I could have definitely I still have the Google  Glass I could definitely integrate it with speed manager where I could see ingredient  weights and work through them while feeding which would be super excellent I don't think  
**[0:44:35-0:44:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:44:35):**  they'll be a huge egg context for it actually because I think we'll get to the point where  you know it's for machine to machine communication and we mostly you know are managing how we  want to operate not specifically like this goes there and all that stuff so yeah I didn't  like I mean yeah it's just it's a great personal tool and all forms of improved communication  are just good for business right so it might be a fun demo like I could see that as like  
**[0:45:03-0:45:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:45:03):**  at a booth at a trade show or something connected to FedEx like not as core to the product but  as a kind of hey come check out this cool thing that you wouldn't otherwise get to try  and learn a bit more about our product I think that might be fun I see people doing that  with kind of virtual reality or other demo things so that that might be a fun one yeah  but I won't lie I talk a bit of trash to people who get a hold to gimmicky so I probably won't  
**[0:45:29-0:45:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:45:29):**  do that okay fair enough I like it cool well Carl good luck in Fargo good luck with the  talk and definitely good luck at the FBN pitch here in a couple weeks I'm really excited  to see where FedEx goes where can people learn more about you or what you're doing what what  would you point them to if they're interested in in learning more and following the journey  yes I mean if you're excited about seed and all that stuff you should definitely come  
**[0:45:57-0:46:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357333#t=0:45:57):**  find me on Twitter that's where most available so at Carl Lippert I'm sure she'll put in  the show notes for you actually I'm at Carl Lippert everywhere so everything from Snapchat  Instagram LinkedIn Facebook it's really easy to find me in the future feed X that I owe  will be where we are hosting the feed exchange so yeah if you hit me up on Twitter now and  in the future feed X that I owe will be the home to learn more fantastic thanks so much

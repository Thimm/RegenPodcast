### Agtech - So What?  (2022-00-06)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to Ag Tech So What.  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  Do you ever think about eggs?  They're pretty miraculous in terms of an ingredient.  They're full of protein, they're flavorful, and they come neatly packaged in a sanitary,  
**[0:00:16-0:00:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:00:16):**  yet easy-to-break shell.  Eggs can be used to bind or brown baked goods and to gel meringue.  They can be scrambled into an omelet or foamed into a creamy topping for a mixed drink.  Eggs is Champions League amongst all proteins precisely because of its versatility and just  the fact that it also has two components, right?  
**[0:00:37-0:00:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:00:37):**  There's the egg white and both come separately but also combined with a whole different set  of functions.  That's Tanya Bogomil.  Tanya is an entrepreneur with over a decade of experience building companies in the digital  space and advising companies in the agri-tech and food sector.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:00:57):**  Today she's the CEO and co-founder of Perfect.  That's Perf Eggt, a Berlin-based alternative protein company that's tackling one of the  toughest challenges in the space, transforming familiar and available plant proteins into  a product that can mimic the versatility of the egg.  Tanya's journey to Perfect started when she was 12 years old with a fateful visit to a  
**[0:01:18-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:01:18):**  slaughterhouse that turned her off meat for good.  I've been a vegetarian since I was a teenager, but I honestly was never really aware of how  inherently dysfunctional the chicken-egg system is because the truth is I love eggs.  They're part of my diet, source of protein and just amazing.  So one day it just got me thinking it's been so easy in the past to cut out animal proteins,  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:01:45):**  milk without cows, burgers without beef.  So us as consumers have so many choices nowadays and I just couldn't stop but wondering there  has to be a way to take chicken out of the egg equation.  Chicken eggs are just the world's most popular animal-based protein and there has to be a  way to build solutions that are appealing for the mass market.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:02:10):**  But Tanya's journey to Perfect wasn't so direct.  She started her first company in the curated shopping space where she tackled the question  of how to build a hybrid in-person online retail fashion solution for the German market  in a way that was digitally native.  As that opportunity drew to a close, she started to think about what was next.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:02:28):**  Yeah, I knew that I wanted to move along the impact profit axis.  I didn't know yet quite well how I would define impact, but I knew it wouldn't be in classical  stationary retail.  So that's when I stepped out to the side line, started to help other entrepreneurs building  their companies, joined a few investment committees and this got me then into food from the entrepreneurial  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:02:53):**  perspective.  And I've actually met one of my co-founders with my prior companies because he was a key  investor into these ones.  Was there a moment when you said, all right, I'm going to leave tech and do something in  eggs?  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:03:08):**  How did that happen?  So I got into alternative eggs really by following a very intrinsically motivated process, diving  very deep into the alternative protein space, evaluating needs and evaluating opportunities.  So Gary Lin, my co-founding investor is also on a mission to take animals out of our food  production and has built Evic together with Simon, another very experienced serial entrepreneur  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:03:41):**  and its venture builder based on that exact mission.  So we teamed up and we also teamed up with our third co-founder and our CPO Bernd, who  is a true pioneer in functionalizing plants to mimic the organoleptic characteristics  of an egg.  We also teamed up with our COO, Simone, she brought products like Beyond Meat to Europe  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:04:05):**  with her team and has been in charge of managing the largest alternative protein portfolio  in all of Europe.  This is how we got started and now over a year later, we are 10 super mission driven  individuals ready to crack the egg.  I love that you use the word organoleptics.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:04:23):**  I only learned what that word means very recently and now I'm pleased that I get to try using  it again.  What's your take on the state of alternative protein investment?  Are you a skeptic of all the kind of froth and interest that's coming into this space?  Or is that something that's useful to perfect and how is Europe differently positioned if  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:04:41):**  at all?  So we are seeing a very great momentum for the alternative protein space.  And this is good because it helps every company on that mission of just changing the system  and implementing more sustainable alternatives here.  Plus, of course, also from a founder's perspective, it makes it easier to really choose the right  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:05:03):**  partners who are not only fully aligned and fully behind that mission, who also know what  it takes to build impact because impact only happens when we match purpose with scale.  And these kind of business models are extremely capital intense.  We do require extremely patient capital if we compare it to many of the digital models.  Europe has always been a little bit challenging when it comes to funding highly innovative  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:05:35):**  topics.  If we take again a look at the digital space before, I've always sensed that European venture  capitalists used to be much more risk averse when it comes to funding deep tech topics,  topics that require high investments, long timelines, higher risks.  And this is changing at this moment.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:05:58):**  So we do definitely see a shift from the classical fast moving consumer goods products towards  more tech driven, more R&D driven topics.  And it's particularly changing in the space of alternative proteins.  I would call it the entire cosmos of the future of food.  And this is a good thing to happen.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:06:21):**  I like that view on a shift from just tech and kind of SaaS platforms and things like  e-commerce into this space.  Obviously, that's more of your background on the retail side and the e-commerce side.  Are there lessons or skills that you take from that experience and you think will be  really applicable in this new world?  
**[0:06:41-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:06:41):**  A radical approach to MVP.  And I can give you a very concrete example for that.  Looking at the egg as a product, and I would love to quote my co-founder Bernd here, who  always says, eggs is Champions League amongst all proteins precisely because of its versatility.  And just the fact that it also has two components.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:07:03):**  Right.  There's the yolk, there's the egg white, and both come separately, but also combined with  a whole different set of functions.  So this is much more complex than, let's say, a burger that just needs to taste great and  that just needs to be fried or a sausage or so.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:07:23):**  So taking a very structured approach to defining what are the key jobs to be done of an egg  and how does this then translate into an R&D strategy, into a product portfolio strategy,  making an MVP driven approach to reconstructing the egg in order to just move fast, develop  a category on the go, learn from a consumer and just move onwards.  So we start by replicating the egg from a shell.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:08:01):**  The first version is a whisked egg.  So that's yolk and egg white combined, and it's working for every single use case where  you also need a whole egg.  So really from standalone scramble to pancakes in specific baking, cookies, but even pasta.  Help me think about an example of that.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:08:23):**  How did you think about your first product or initial testing that you did?  Give me a sense of how fast you guys are moving and what some of those MVPs are that you're  building.  So 70% of an egg is egg from shell.  Main use cases are simply egg dishes, which account for over 50% of all egg applications.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:08:43):**  And baking is number two, accounting still for a whopping 20%.  Main jobs to be done of an egg are source of protein without the carb deal and a very  convenient meal, a very convenient dish to be prepared.  So for us, it was very straightforward to focus on a ready to use liquid egg replacement  in the first place.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:09:07):**  That is building upon a protein system and a lipid system that just serves that exact  purpose.  It's best for scrambled applications, cooking applications, and future iterations of the  product also included the baking per dimension so that the current version that we're about  to bring to the market in a few weeks from now is actually already covering full branch  
**[0:09:32-0:09:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:09:32):**  experience.  But the path towards that where many different smaller and larger iterations testing, reiterating,  optimizing again to really continue moving, but also learning on the go.  You mentioned that you have people on your team who come from the tech side, probably  the research side, and then also the more alternative protein side.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:09:55):**  Is there ever a tension in the balance of we have to go fast, we have to ship this versus  no, we have to get the science right, or this is food, we need to make sure it's all safe.  How do you balance that?  So safety is definitely a thing.  And I'm also as a digital entrepreneur by nature, I'm also learning that we have to  
**[0:10:14-0:10:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:10:14):**  just adapt these timelines to it.  And it's a little bit like in the digital world where you have product development and  IT, the engineers always in this very healthy battlefield.  It's similar to the food world where you have product and just commercialization in this  very healthy battlefield.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:10:36):**  So what is in tech development is how good is good enough.  So here, but this is nothing that is based on internal opinions.  This is what consumers tell us.  This is what end users tell us, what chefs tell us, culinary experts tell us, who work  with the product.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:10:57):**  So we're just giving out a few thousand of egg equivalents, have them cooked, have them  baked, et cetera, provides us with the kind of data we need in order to not make any opinionated  decision or just best guesses, but really just get the data points and then decide and  strictly prioritize what are must haves and what are nice to have.  So I give you a very concrete example for that.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:11:23):**  The goal is to come as closely to the egg as possible, not only in a nutritional profile,  but also in terms of application usage.  And that's why it's so important to have similar cooking times, to have a similar pattern when  it's prepared, similar gelation process, when it's heated in a pan, et cetera.  But our current version of the protein system takes slightly longer than a classical egg.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:11:55):**  However, it remains stable when it's left in the pan.  So here our current version of the product even outperforms the egg because you can never  leave a scrambled egg in a pan half heated.  It's dehydrating.  It's losing its color.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:12:12):**  It's losing its form.  But chefs love the fact that perfect remains stable in a pan.  And we would have never guessed that.  We can only learn that by talking to end users and then prioritizing it.  So we accept that it takes slightly longer to cook it with the result of still having  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:12:31):**  a better overall result.  Were you nervous the first time you had someone taste the product that it wouldn't stack up  for you were already very confident?  No, very nervous.  And I'm nervous every single time.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:12:42):**  But I think and I'm convinced that being nervous is good because it keeps us awake.  It keeps us alerted.  The worst thing that can happen is that we become overconfident.  And where are you up to in terms of like cost parity with eggs?  Taste you mentioned before.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:13:00):**  If you had to go head to head with an egg, where do you, where are you ahead and where  are you behind?  So the challenge with eggs is that we are not paying the true price for it.  Eggs should be at least twice as expensive as they are to just cover the real costs.  We are currently in the exact same price premium corridor than other alternative meat products  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:13:22):**  and alternative dairy products are.  So we slightly more expensive than a premium organic solution.  And what's been the response from consumers so far?  Do you think that's a challenge that they're willing to take on and pay for or you're going  to have to come down the cost curve to open up a broader market?  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:13:42):**  This is the only way to start.  Starting as a premium product, this is the only positioning that's working on the market  simply because we have to get to scale.  It's like with any other food product here.  What's most important though is just to have a very clear path to what price parity in  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:14:02):**  place that will come with scale, that will also come with novel ingredients that are  more sustainable, that are cheaper, that are more efficient than what is available on the  market right now.  So in the end here, this is always a journey and this will always be a journey to move  towards price parity.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:14:24):**  And for that, it's so important to reach scale as fast as possible.  When you think about the other uses of the egg, are there ones that are like really hard  to do, but if you do that, you're going to win in the alternative egg category?  Or how do you think about the other aspects of an egg that you'll need to recreate?  I believe it's just only doing the eggs of justice.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:14:49):**  Yeah.  If we develop different products that serve different purposes, especially in the beginning.  So that's also why we have built everything into a step-by-step product roadmap.  So starting with this one use case and then using the existing protein system and apply  it into other verticals and applications.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:15:13):**  Asking consumers, we see and we learn that they do not necessarily require a one-fits-all  purpose product simply because what counts most from consumer and end users perspective  is what works best, what is affordable and what is also kind of intuitive.  So we really need to keep in mind that it will require quite some consumer, some market  education so that consumers and the market learns that it can come from plants.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:15:45):**  It doesn't necessarily require a chicken, eggs can come from a bottle.  And so this will be a very natural process to do that.  How would consumers react to a completely artificial egg that's coming with two faces  in an artificially produced shell that has to be cracked and then most likely to be thrown  away?  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:16:12):**  So it creates much more complexity than just shifting the product format as well.  So the egg without the chicken, but also without the shell, I guess is part of this.  When you think of the future, do you imagine there'll be multiple alternative egg providers  that win in different categories?  So some will sit in shell eggs and some in baking and some will be embedded in different  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:16:31):**  products or how do you see that market evolving?  So the egg market will never be a winner takes all market.  And yet we see that it's the fastest growing category, it's the most underserved category.  If we compare to the more mature categories like meat or dairy with much higher market  penetration rates, eggs and egg alternatives are below 1%.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:16:53):**  So clearly there will be so much room for growth.  You mentioned, I mean, that it is a space attracting more attention and probably more  competitors for you.  You mentioned some of the technology you're using is existing technology and there's established  supply chains for some of what you're procuring.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:17:09):**  How do you think about differentiation?  So it all starts with the type of raw materials that are being used.  We've taken a radically local approach to it.  So our goal was and will always be to focus on those types of proteins and lipids that  can be sourced locally.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:17:31):**  Yeah, that do not need to be shipped all around the globe, for example.  We have also built a team and a system that allows us to stay super, super close to the  taste buds of consumers, of European consumers, but also of global consumers.  And here again, looking at the importance of taste, looking at the importance of a flavor  system that comes really close to the flavor of an egg is of the essence because flavor  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:18:03):**  in eggs is amazing.  If you consider a raw egg, it almost smells like nothing.  But once it's cooked, like over 100 compounds of flavors of odors are evolving.  And to build a system in order to mimic this with plant based or with alternative proteins  will be challenging, but will be needed to just make it as attractive as possible for  
**[0:18:28-0:18:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:18:28):**  consumers to try it.  And we believe that we have set up the system for doing exactly that.  And you guys started, if I understand correctly, with fava beans as the input.  Tell me about that decision.  And if you think you'll stick with those long term.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:18:44):**  Yeah.  So this goes back again to the to this process of deconstructing and reconstructing the egg.  Developing in the first place a very clear understanding of what makes an egg an egg,  what are the molecular and biochemical mechanisms that are underlying, what are the different  functionality drivers, and then matching it in a very data driven approach with available  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:19:11):**  sources for that.  And here, a protein system based on pulses just works best.  So we love fava bean because it can be locally grown.  We also love certain peas because for the exact same reason coming with good amino acid  profiles, adding high functionality to the product.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:19:31):**  But if we look at what is needed in order to bring the alternative very close in terms  of organoleptic characteristics, etc, we will always hit a limit when staying purely plant  based.  Yeah.  So that is why we've also built a system for strategic protein research for strategic lipid  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:19:51):**  research that will allow us to build better versions of the product in the future.  Because fava bean or pea or chickpea or whatsoever, which is simply never be the best possible  solution.  Yeah, we will always come short in terms of bioavailability of the protein.  It'll also always be super expensive.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:20:13):**  So we will have to get to other solutions in the future for scale.  If you imagine that is cultured fermented partners with other animals, like what are  the options there that you're thinking about?  So we are looking into fermentation for that, just simply for the reason that this technology  is most developed.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:20:35):**  Yeah, it's very clear timelines, market readiness, admission timelines, everything classifies  as novel food for now.  But in a year and a half, two, three years, we will have access to these exact new kind  of sources.  Regarding the cell based options, I'm very much in favor of this use case for meat alternatives,  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:21:01):**  a bit hesitant for the egg use case simply because of again, timelines and past what's  price parity.  These types of technologies are still in a very early stage with no clear path to scale,  no clear path to getting a semi robust version of the technoeconomics of it.  And this is why we are mainly focusing on fermentation.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:21:26):**  Yeah, there's a couple of kind of tensions I want to tease out here that are really interesting  to me, Tanya.  One is the comparison between alternative protein eggs and traditional eggs.  And that kind of is how the market gets framed as we're replacing it, we're taking out the  chicken.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:21:43):**  Do you think that's the right narrative versus alternatives like creating a new category  maybe like margarine has done where it wasn't a butter alternative, it was just a new category?  Very interesting point, Sarah.  So from my perspective, this means to an end, yeah, in order, we need to help consumers  and end users to understand the concept first.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:22:09):**  And here, this very simple narrative taking chicken out is from consumer perspective,  the way to go.  However, it's not about just bashing the traditional industry, bashing the animal based production  systems, it's all about just creating better new ways, new systems that will allow us to  also nourish and feed 10 billion people in the future.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:22:37):**  One of the challenges I see with the alternative protein space in general and with eggs in  particular is that eggs are natural and that they aren't processed, they're washed and  things like that, but they're not processed as such.  And yet the words I'm hearing you using are like protein system and different ingredients,  and there's technologies involved, which sounds and is a lot more engineered than the natural  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:23:00):**  version that is an egg.  How do you see that tension and kind of consumer acceptance around this processed view?  So eggs are a wonderful product.  However, it is simply possible to build a better version of an egg in the sense of matching  the jobs to be done, matching the macro nutritional profile, matching the micronutritional profile,  
**[0:23:20-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:23:20):**  but simply without the negative causes, without the negative impact on health, on climate,  on animal welfare.  It's interesting, like that's why kind of my head goes to the category creation opportunity.  And that's why I wanted to ask you about it, because when we think about just the one to  one comparison, there's lots of reasons it doesn't stack up.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:23:41):**  And yet to your point, the scrambled benefits that I can leave it in the pan and forget  about it when I go make my coffee is actually a new benefit that doesn't exist with the  current product.  And so that leads me to positioning it differently where I'm not competing with eggs, but I'm  creating this new category.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:23:56):**  I don't know if that's on the horizon at all for you guys, or you think it will continue  with comparison to eggs as they exist today?  No, absolutely.  It's clearly all about creating this new category and it's just a hack, so to say, to start  market education by just coming and differentiating from one just because it has become so normal  
**[0:24:17-0:24:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:24:17):**  to switch from cow's milk to oat-based milk, to switch from classical burgers and sausages  to alternative.  This is already a learned pattern that has been proven successful.  This new category building then, and also establishing a brand in a space where consumers  aren't buying for brands.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:24:39):**  Not even for labels, it is a second step in that.  You imagine that's how the industry will evolve, where we buy based on brands, I guess more  like we do with cereal today, where we don't think about what's in it and the plants that  composed it, we buy based on the brand.  Do you think that's how it will be for different protein categories?  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:24:56):**  Absolutely.  Yes, we will be seeing this.  We have been seeing this process with companies like Oatly and we will be seeing this in other  step of food categories.  Yeah, it's interesting.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:25:07):**  I think pretty consistent with our view that as we bring in these new products, it's a  category and brand creation opportunity, not just a head-to-head competition with livestock  and animal protein, especially given that demand for both is growing.  I guess I agree with you there.  When you think about the challenge though of, I guess, replacing eggs in the system,  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:25:27):**  especially from an environmental perspective, when there's a lot of eggs out there, there's  a lot of people eating eggs.  Do you think that it will be more complimentary versus a substitute that people will continue  using eggs as well as add in the perfect product and other alternatives?  If so, how do you measure success or is it truly that substitution that you're looking  
**[0:25:49-0:25:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:25:49):**  for?  Absolutely.  This is also how we measure success.  Eggs have similar consumption rates like milk, so being consumed on average three times per  week.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:26:01):**  We know we did our job well.  If consumers from time to time make the conscious decision to just drop the animal-based product  and switch to the alternative.  I think there's the ingredient challenge, like how those crops are produced at scale.  Then there's the processing challenge as well.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:26:18):**  Are the facilities going to run on renewable energy and how do you actually measure?  You could also have chicken sheds running on renewable energy as well, and there's uses  of the manure, so it will be interesting.  It's not a trivial set of equations to solve for when you do these environmental comparisons.  Absolutely.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:26:36):**  It will never be what's just so important to get started somewhere and then just take  it from there and improve on the goal.  How you have started is really interesting to me with the direct to consumer model and  starting with something as hard as individuals eating your product versus having it in a  baked good or somewhere where you have a bit more maybe flexibility to meet the performance  
**[0:26:57-0:26:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:26:57):**  and taste characteristics.  How did you think about starting there and any challenges with that angle versus something  that I would perceive as a bit easier?  With Perfect, we are starting with a food service first approach to really have this  product prepared in a culinary controlled environment.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:27:16):**  One and to have the time to build up the category via communication, via marketing campaigns,  PR, et cetera.  That's because it is new to end users and by end users, staffs, for example, and consumers  equally.  Yeah, so that's why food service first is key here, and it has been proven in other  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:27:39):**  categories as well.  But then again, when we talk about hitting scale fast, there will not be a way around  retail being at the point of sale that's also required for trust, specifically in Europe.  It might be different outside of Europe, but point of sale is number one source for trust  on consumer side.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:28:00):**  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense to start in food service because someone else is preparing  it.  I know I've had the experience of trying something at a tasting or when a chef's prepared it  and being like, this product's great.  And then I come home and try to cook it and I'm like, it's horrible, but it turns out  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:28:12):**  like I'm just not a very good cook.  There's also scale challenges, I imagine, of getting to the volume where these B2B providers  will want to work with you.  I want to jump back here to something a little bit more of your personal journey and how  it's going.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:28:25):**  Do you love your job?  You sound like you love it and you're really passionate about it, but is that true?  I'm so enthusiastic about what I do.  So for me, coming from the digital space, I have struggled so long to find my personal  definition of impact profit alignment.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:28:43):**  I've looked at so many different things, so many opportunities were presented to me, and  I really wanted to reach a flow state where I just know I know my why.  I know what I get up for in the morning.  I know how I want to create impact.  I know how I want to measure my personal success as well as an entrepreneur.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:29:04):**  That is creating an environment where other individuals can thrive, where everybody can  just grow into the best version of themselves and also having a very clear understanding  of what we all get up for in the morning.  And this is just so fulfilling.  Yeah.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:29:20):**  But of course, it's also challenging.  Building a category definer isn't easy, but just having this trust and conviction of simply  doing the right thing and having the confidence that regardless of what's coming, either we'll  find a way or we'll make one is the best thing I can think of.  I wouldn't be doing anything else.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:29:47):**  Do you have an example just to make it concrete, whether it's something you learned from your  previous business or something at Perfect, whether it's fundraising or a product formulation  or something with a team that kind of didn't go to plan or a mistake that you really had  to build grit and now see it as a building block to success?  There are roadblocks on the way on every single dimension that you just mentioned, setbacks  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:30:09):**  in a product, just hypothesis that turn out to be wrong, that need to be reformulated,  reworked on.  One key thing that I've learned in these past 12 years, team is key.  And it's so vital as an entrepreneur to simply never compromise on team.  So to really choose the people well and by people and team, I'm not only talking about  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:30:37):**  direct colleagues and the operational team, it applies to supporters.  It applies to investors.  People often say that entrepreneurs or founders have to pitch for funding and have to pitch  for investors.  But in the end, it's also the other way around.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:30:56):**  Investors need to pitch in front of founders because in the end, founders decide whom they  want to let in into the inner circle.  And the key learning of many mistakes that I've also made in the past is moving too fast  into false compromises, having the feeling to move out of a position of weakness and  not out of a position of strength.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:31:25):**  So this is something that I've also done completely different here with my partners at Perfect  in order to make it last.  There is a lot to learn from the way that Tanya and Perfect are taking on the challenge  of creating an egg alternative.  But there were a few key insights that jumped out at me.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:31:43):**  First, Tanya talked about how her team has approached getting to an MVP.  By deconstructing the egg, they were, from a technical perspective, able to tackle one  functionality at a time.  Considering the versatility and complexity of eggs and the way that chefs and consumers  expect to use them, this is key.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:31:59):**  But understanding the egg as a food is only half the battle.  Tanya also talked about understanding the egg as a category, one where price, function,  flavor, and familiarity are all paramount.  She believes brand dominance could be a major feature of the egg alternative market in the  future, particularly as prices come down and consumer familiarity with products increases.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:32:20):**  And finally, people are everything.  For Tanya, this starts with her team and her own motivation for doing the work, and extends  through relationships with partners, investors, tasters, chefs, and consumers.  Having a competitive product in this space takes incredible alignment among a big group  of stakeholders, and achieving that is a challenge in and of itself.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:32:39):**  In that way, I guess, Perfect as a company is aiming to achieve something similar in  the kitchen as they are in the world.  A complete package with a hearty, yolk-like technology at the center, floating in a slick  but versatile brand and business model, all within a protective shell of collaborators  and supporters.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/4/7/tanja-bogumil-vegan-eggs-plant-based-alternative-protein-startup#t=0:32:56):**  So, this has been another episode of Ag Tech So What.  We want to thank Tanya Bogomil, founder and CEO of Perfect, and Bjorn Heinz for recommending  that we chat with her.  And of course, thank you for listening.

    ### Agtech - So What?  (2018-12-04)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:00):**  Hey, podcast listeners, Sarah here, bringing you a quick update.  We've been hard at work recording season two, and we really appreciate all your feedback  during our first 25 episodes.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:11):**  We'll be taking that on board.  Two things especially.  First, better audio quality.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:16):**  We have a new team behind us and some new gear, so hopefully that will make a big difference.  And second, a renewed focus on the intersection of ag and tech.  And with that, a new website and a new name, Ag Tech So What.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:30):**  We'll still have entrepreneurs and investors and tech people on the show, but this season  we'll be bringing on farmers and industry experts who are working with and developing  technologies all along the supply chain.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:42):**  There's so much happening around the world in ag tech, new companies, events, investors,  but at the end of the day, technologies have to solve a real problem and create real value  for users.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:51):**  This is what we want to focus on, the real So What of ag tech.  I'm really excited about this season.  I've already recorded some amazing episodes and really look forward to having them out  
**[0:01:02-0:01:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:01:02):**  soon.  But in the meantime, I need your help.  First, please like us or leave us a review in iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:01:08):**  It helps others to find the show.  And second, I'd love any recommendations for guests we should have on.  Hit me up at SV Knowles on Twitter or through the new website agtechsowhat.com.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:01:22):**  On the site, you can still see all of the blogs and previous episodes.  So check it out if you haven't.  We've had some amazing guests on.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:01:28):**  So that's it for me.  Thank you again for your support and catch you soon on the first episode of the new season  of Ag Tech So What.

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:00):**  Hey, podcast listeners, Sarah here, bringing you a quick update.  
**[0:00:05-0:00:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:05):**  We've been hard at work recording season two, and we really appreciate all your feedback  
**[0:00:09-0:00:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:09):**  during our first 25 episodes.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:11):**  We'll be taking that on board.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:13):**  Two things especially.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:14):**  First, better audio quality.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:16):**  We have a new team behind us and some new gear, so hopefully that will make a big difference.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:21):**  And second, a renewed focus on the intersection of ag and tech.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:25):**  And with that, a new website and a new name, Ag Tech So What.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:30):**  We'll still have entrepreneurs and investors and tech people on the show, but this season  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:34):**  we'll be bringing on farmers and industry experts who are working with and developing  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:38):**  technologies all along the supply chain.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:42):**  There's so much happening around the world in ag tech, new companies, events, investors,  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:45):**  but at the end of the day, technologies have to solve a real problem and create real value  
**[0:00:50-0:00:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:50):**  for users.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:51):**  This is what we want to focus on, the real So What of ag tech.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:55):**  I'm really excited about this season.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:00:57):**  I've already recorded some amazing episodes and really look forward to having them out  
**[0:01:02-0:01:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:01:02):**  soon.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:01:03):**  But in the meantime, I need your help.

**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:01:08):**  It helps others to find the show.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357335#t=0:01:11):**  And second, I'd love any recommendations for guests we should have on.

### Agtech - So What?  (2019-03-03)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly changing  the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting started.  But there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between ag and  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:00:35):**  ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring you the  story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where ag and tech  meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. Hello, everyone. Oh, everyone's here now. This is  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:01:09):**  awesome. I'm Sarah Nolette. I'm the founder of Agfentik. We're an innovation advisory  firm in the agri-food sector here in Australia and in the US. And I'm really thrilled to  be moderating this session because it's one of my favorite topics. And I imagine it's  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:01:22):**  a good one for you guys as well. Before I bring up the panelists, I'm going to make  you guys do a little bit of work. Can you guys tell me a little bit about who you are?  So raise your hand if you're an entrepreneur. Investor. Farmer. What are we missing? Researcher.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:01:42):**  Nonprofit. No? Okay, great. So a really good mix and really interested to hear some questions  from you guys. It's an interactive session, so you'll be able to use the app as well  as come up and ask questions via the microphone. So I'd like to welcome to the stage the panelists.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:01:58):**  This is obviously a range of perspectives from insects to indoor farms to cooperative  dairy farms. So we'll cover quite a bit of ground here, all focused around feeding the  future and doing so in ways that aren't exactly like the conventional, traditional agricultural  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:02:13):**  systems. So I won't do too much on the panelists. I'll let them introduce themselves. So why  don't I have all of you guys actually just come up to the stage. Please help me welcome  them. So you guys can read more about them in the program and I'm sure all over social  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:02:34):**  media and the brochures, but I'll have you guys each do a quick sort of 30 second intro  on yourselves and a little bit about your companies. Dror, do you want to start? Sure,  thank you. Shalom, my name is Dror Tamir. I'm from Israel and I'm the co-founder and  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:02:50):**  CEO of Hargol Food Tech and we are the first in the world to grow grasshoppers on commercial  scale. Grasshoppers are nature's most efficient protein source. Thank you. Great. James? James  Pataris, Modular Farms. We build modular containerised farming systems using vertical hydroponics.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:03:11):**  Kia ora, I'm Emma Parsons. I'm from Aggregate, which is a joint venture between two of New  Zealand's largest dairy cooperatives, Fonterra and Livestock Improvement Corporation. We're  a data platform that brings the rich data sets from the New Zealand dairy industry together  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:03:30):**  to help provide new insights for farmers so that they can become more sustainable and  profitable. My name is Olympia Yaga. I'm the founder and CEO of GoTerra. We manage food  waste in maggot robots. Well done. I think that was the first panel introduction that  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:03:44):**  kept everyone under 30 seconds, so we're off to a good start. I want to go back through  everyone and just have you tell the origin story of your company. So how did you get  involved in what you're doing and how did the company actually start? We'll go the reverse  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:03:57):**  order this time. I started in conventional agriculture and I left and went to the US  for a while. Tried to come back to go back to agriculture and the cost of entry was too  high. So started looking at alternate feed opportunities, found insects and yeah, maggots  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:04:17):**  in my kitchen and now maggots in a warehouse. It's a logical progression obviously. We might  have to come back. There's some questions there I think, but we'll keep going for now.  Emma? So I'm from a dairy farm originally. I grew up in South Taranaki in New Zealand  
**[0:04:34-0:04:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:04:34):**  and my father is an ecologist, so I sort of developed a real love of the land and a love  of agriculture and in a biodiversity in particularly since I was very, very young. And throughout  my career in the dairy industry, I've focused on that in different ways and I've sort of  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:04:53):**  thought about it from the perspective that sustainability for farmers is highly related  to building capability and to do that you need to know where you are now and what good  looks like. And so aggregate, the genesis of aggregate is based around that, which is  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:05:09):**  that we know all of this information about what good looks like. If we can get really,  really granular insights for farmers about where they are currently today and what the  opportunity is for them, we can highlight those profitability shifts and sustainability shifts.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:05:24):**  So we're very lucky in New Zealand from the richness of the data that's existed from decades  and decades of cooperatives and so it's an amazing opportunity to be able to leverage that.  Great. James? Cool. So a bit about my background. I grew up in western Victoria on a vegetable  
**[0:05:41-0:05:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:05:41):**  farm out there, broadacre. Went through a severe drought sometime in the early 2000s.  Realised that what my grandfather and father have gone through over the past 50 years,  60 years was not going to be sustainable going forward. So found myself getting involved  
**[0:05:59-0:06:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:05:59):**  with hydroponics but then more so small systems like containerised farming and yeah, found  myself working at modular farms and developing our system over here and in Canada.  I was born in the kibbutz. My grandfather was the chairman of that kibbutz and he established  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:06:24):**  two facilities. One is called Galam, the largest corn processor in Israel. He was also the  CEO of that company and Ambar. Ambar is the largest feed producer in Israel. So you can  understand that I have some connection to agriculture and food but the main connection  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:06:41):**  actually came from my grandmother because she was the cook of the kibbutz. Another thing  that happened in those years when I was really young in the kibbutz, they used to tell me  stories about the 1950s when Israel suffered from locust swarms that came and ate all the  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:06:53):**  crops. They used to go out to the fields, try to scare the grasshoppers away and they  saw other people coming into those fields collecting the grasshoppers and eating them.  So I learned that grasshoppers are both food and are kosher. 30 years later, when I was  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:07:10):**  looking for alternative protein, the answer was waiting for me already.  Great. So one of the themes that gets talked about a lot in the alternative farming space  is sustainability and the potential of these new farming systems to improve the sustainability.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:07:26):**  I'm curious how much is that a part of your business and part of your personal mission  in what you're doing in the company? So, Emma, I might start with you.  Thanks. So, I mean, it's completely fundamental to me personally. I think that all value in  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:07:42):**  our economy ultimately stems from the environment and the relationships that we have with our  natural environment. And I think farmers probably feel that much more keenly than some others  in our society. I think that we live a lot closer to the land. So it's such a part of  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:08:04):**  the fabric of our communities in New Zealand as well. And it's also under a lot of pressure.  Obviously, natural resource constraints and regulation are really important forces at  play for farmers. And so anything that we can do to accelerate the transition and enable  
**[0:08:25-0:08:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:08:25):**  that transition to happen in a way that is supportive and empowering for farmers, I think  is really important. So it's absolutely fundamental to everything that that aggregate is doing.  Great. I want to kind of pull on that thread a little bit around the role of farmers. And  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:08:43):**  when we talk about alternative farming systems, it's often sort of in contrast to conventional  farming systems and almost in kind of conflict with them. And I wonder to what degree you  see that as true. And is it sort of we move to this alternative model? Is it a slow transition?  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:08:58):**  And what is the kind of role of today's farmers in the future systems that you guys are building?  Anyone want to volunteer?  I think it's an interesting conversation because it's particularly in the insect side, when  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:09:13):**  the general narrative in insect farming is that insects are more sustainable because  they're smaller and we use less feed. And that just to me actually translates more into  that it'll just take a little longer for us to run out, right? And so it's more about  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:09:28):**  in durability of your system and how it fits into the ecosystem. And so when we look at  it from Gautera's perspective, so yes, we manage waste, but where do we fit into an  ecosystem? So I don't subscribe to the mentality that insect protein will stop us overfishing  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:09:49):**  the oceans and or save us from soy. But I do believe that insects have a role to play  integrated into the existing conventional ecosystem. And so from the Insect Protein  Association's point of view, when we talk about sustainability, we say things like,  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:10:09):**  where do insects fit in existing farming models? And so we speak a lot to farmers who are looking  to drought-proof their industries by bringing insects for food production onto their farms  because insects require far less water, 400 milliliters per kilo of protein produced,  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:10:27):**  far less arable land, far less input. Some of them don't require sunlight. And so can  we integrate an additional type of production system to existing production systems? That  to me is more about sustainability because it includes the conversation of endurability  
**[0:10:48-0:10:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:10:48):**  and the capability of farmers to sustain their production capability, not necessarily whether  or not by farming mealworms I will be able to farm them forever. I think that's more  important. Right. Go ahead, James. I probably want to speak a bit about the sustainability  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:11:07):**  side of things and I agree with you, Olympia. I think being the only sort of indoor farming  speaker here on the panel, it would be naive to say that we're a sustainable solution because  we use so much power. One of the things that we are able to do is provide efficiencies  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:11:25):**  in other things like resources like water or nutrient delivery or better plant health.  So I mean, one of the misconceiving things about indoor farming is that it's going to  be feeding the world or it's the future. It's definitely another cog in the wheel and it's  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:11:43):**  definitely another platform that we can grow food with. But yeah, I sort of agree. I mean,  I think there's always going to be a place for precision agriculture in the field as  well as a factory being built as a farm or a container being placed in rural isolated  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:12:00):**  Australia feeding a small town creating a micro economy. So yeah, I think sustainability  is a very widely used term but I think it sort of lacks a real definition. Yep, might  fall off the stage. Not a good idea. I want to ask about the perceptions of alternative  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:12:21):**  farming and both from potential investors in the company, from consumers of your product,  how have you managed the narrative and the marketing and the perceptions around being  an alternative? Well, perception of alternative farming, when we talk about trying to convince  
**[0:12:38-0:12:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:12:38):**  a developed world investor to invest in a grasshopper farm. Five years ago when we started,  the response was you're disgusting, you're strange, you're weird. I think the only compliment  was you're just too exotic for us. So it's not about eating the insects, not perception  
**[0:12:58-0:13:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:12:58):**  of insects, it's the perception of the business and it was really hard and I think what worked  for us in Israel was something that we call Tikkun Olam, that's in the Jewish tradition,  in the Israeli tradition. Tikkun Olam means make the world a better place and it means  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:13:17):**  that we're not supposed to think only about ourselves, we need to think about everyone  around the world, how we can make their world a better place and when we looked at that,  we learned that 2.5 billion people across the world eat insects as part of their diet,  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:13:32):**  but today they collect them in the wild and this means it is very expensive, the quality  is not good and the availability is very limited to about four to six weeks a year and once  we understood that and this is completely out of the box because I never ate grasshoppers  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:13:50):**  or insects before, we learned that there's a huge potential and then we started getting  some investors.  Interesting. Did you want to add to that?  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:14:01):**  In Australia, the insects, just to talk a bit more about the insect part, the challenge  was the story of sustainability and this magic bullet to save the world was coming and insects  were it, but we were ignoring in a sales way the fact that across the board alternative  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:14:23):**  farming solutions have been promising now for a decade to solve this massive problem  and hadn't delivered and certainly when you look at insects, there are about six big insect  farms in the world and they're mostly in Europe and America, so one in South Africa and between  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:14:43):**  them they've all raised about $300 million, it's between six of them and none of them  have delivered on the metric tonnage that they promised and on top of that, some of  them still will not announce their production capability and when that happens, alternate  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:05):**  opportunities start to diminish their credibility because the sales pitch is not meeting the  delivery and so in Australia, the challenge for us when we were looking at investors was  to first get in the door because we were an insect farm, they immediately thought that  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:22):**  we were there to talk about protein, so we had to sort of talk about the fact that we  were trying to deliver a completely different solution altogether that stepped out of that  very investor speak world.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:35):**  It raises an interesting issue around transparency and the transparency in the insect industry,  but also the consumer desire for transparency and how that's driving some of the investment  and innovation in this space.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:47):**  Emma, do you want to touch a little bit on transparency and how that plays a role in  aggregate?  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:15:53-0:16:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:53):**  So Fonterra, which is one of the partners of aggregate, is a large dairy exporter out  of New Zealand and services all of the global markets.  There's a great deal of demand for transparency, particularly at this point in time around  
**[0:16:09-0:16:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:16:09):**  food safety and quality, but that will extend and is extending into animal welfare, into  environmental performance and what's the environmental footprint of the product, into things like  biosecurity, so that the full kind of gambit of attributes of a product and we hear a lot  
**[0:16:30-0:16:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:16:30):**  around increasingly personalised nutrition and people seek proof points around how is  this nutrition different for me physically, but also how is it different for me from an  ethical perspective.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:16:46):**  So to enable any of those things to occur in any real way, there's a huge transformation  in data collection and data aggregation that's actually required in all of our food systems.  It's really surprised me now, the more that I understand about it, actually just where  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:04):**  the gaps are in information about how food's produced and we've got some good regulatory  frameworks but they're not at all comprehensive enough, they don't cover all of the aspects  that consumers are increasingly interested in and so there's this really interesting  
**[0:17:19-0:17:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:19):**  kind of pinch point for farmers which is in some aspects they're adopting these technologies  for farm performance, but actually it's that information that will drive value through  the value chain further down the track.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:33):**  So I think that it's an absolutely fundamental, it will form a fundamental piece of your brand  proposition for any food product that you're selling in the very near future.  Interesting.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:46):**  James, I want you to comment on this as well, but I guess just to push a little bit, I think  there's a lot of talk around we want transparency, we want to know where everything comes from  and I'm not actually sure that that's true in all cases and people are busy and when  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:59):**  they're shopping they don't want to read about a farm for 20 minutes before they buy a loaf  of bread, so I'm curious I guess to just go a little deeper and now you're up for the  challenge James, around do consumers really want this and from a business model perspective  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:14):**  as a farm, how do you think about that?  Yeah, good question.  I think the transparency side of things and going into that, one of the misconceiving  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:25):**  things that we found in our industry when it was born, it was sort of all about growing  the most in the small space.  There's nothing really concentrated on about food quality, uniformity in plants and health  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:38):**  of plants, it was just about how can we fit the most in the small space.  What we've seen now is that that is not going to always work in any market.  A lot of what we did here in Australia, we actually conducted a lot of market research  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:53):**  in areas that we felt the modular farm will suit best, so rural and isolated specifically  because we felt the urban environment was so saturated with product that we were never  going to be able to compete on a cost basis.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:19:07):**  And you're absolutely right, people aren't prepared to sit there reading a blurb for  about 30 minutes on where the providence of the food or where it's come from, they just  want to know it's clean, healthy and potentially has no pesticides or chemicals.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:19:22):**  So for us, we've had to change our model a lot in terms of our business case and really  evolve in terms of offering consumers something that's more palatable in terms of a product  because us selling a $3 lettuce is not going to be sustainable in the long run for a business  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:19:41):**  model.  So we've seen our business change a fair bit in terms of who we're supplying and the customers  we're supplying and a lot of it does, I mean having to grow food in a box is not cheap  
**[0:19:57-0:20:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:19:57):**  but there is definitely a lot of value in local food, clean food and that food security.  So we do know through our research that we can actually obtain a more of a premium price  on product with those factors involved in it.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:15):**  You touched a little bit on the changes you've needed to make to respond to that.  I think it's a really interesting question in alternative farming especially, the different  business models and we heard from AeroFarms yesterday and plenty has been mentioned and  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:28):**  there's other insect farms out there and do you control the whole supply chain, do you  sell the technology, do you sell the branded product, do you try to do it all, where do  you fit and what business model you actually adopt.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:38):**  I'm curious how you guys have tried to crack that nut and maybe a story or the kind of  narrative around how it's changed.  Dror, do you want to start?  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:47):**  Sure, well I just said that there is very high demand for grasshoppers all over Africa,  try to raise funds to build the grasshopper farm in Israel and serve Africa.  Probably you will get nothing, you will not be able to raise any money.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:03):**  So we had to change the business model and try to focus on a different customer first  to raise the money.  So we changed it to the US and Europe and this helped us raise money, as simple as that.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:16):**  Right, so it was just a geographical change.  That's one of them, I have many other examples like that but you have to be flexible and  you have to understand how to talk to your customer, if your customer is the actual customer  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:31):**  that buys the product, if your customer is the investor that is looking for an investment  that will be as close as possible to their own field, you have to be flexible.  Just to push a little further, can you give an example of how you maybe talk to an investor  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:46):**  different or how you would pitch this to an investor different than a consumer?  Well with consumer, you can't tell the entire story.  With investor, you have a few more minutes that you can do that.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:59):**  You can't tell the consumer that these are the most widely eaten insects in the world,  you can't tell them the story that this is actually part of everyone's history.  They are mentioned in the Bible, 3000 years old food, they are kosher, they are mentioned  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:15):**  in the Quran, they are mentioned in the New Testament, John the Baptist used to eat grass  hoppers with honey.  There's a lot of stories behind the product and there's a lot of opportunities but eventually  
**[0:22:25-0:22:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:25):**  if someone goes into Sainsbury in the UK and he sees that product, you have three seconds.  So you have very limited time and you have to make your decision.  Are you going to talk about sustainability?  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:38):**  Are you going to talk about the health benefits?  Maybe you're going to talk just about price.  Sure.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:44):**  Olympia, do you want to talk a little bit about business model evolution for GoTerra?  Yeah, so I started protein, we were going to make protein save the world and that was  a really great idea.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:56):**  So the more our colony grew and the bigger it got, I realised that the amount of food  waste I would need to make livestock feed from maggots was just not, it didn't make  sense.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:23:14):**  So you need 25 tonnes of waste to make one tonne of protein and that's astronomical when  you consider that most of our waste, 60% of all food waste comes out of households.  So I think for us it was pretty pivotal to, once I started seeing those numbers, it just  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:23:32):**  didn't make sense.  So we flipped and became a fee for service system that charges for waste management and  just happens to also make a protein on the backside.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:23:45):**  That was super compelling to our investors because again it comes back to that in durability.  That can endure.  That means that because we aren't focused on the size of our colony to make protein,  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:23:58):**  we can just focus on managing waste streams effectively and efficiently and then that  means that we have a place in this ecosystem to create enough protein to start selling  into even the pet food market was never going, like you're looking at thousands of tonnes  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:16):**  a month, which is 25,000 tonnes of food waste.  It's already been consumed with other alternate farming systems.  So I think for us it just always comes back to that ecosystem where alternative farming  
**[0:24:31-0:24:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:31):**  ideas can't exist in silos.  They have to be a great idea that then integrates with their stakeholders, the industry.  They need to become an industry of their own and through that develop the best practice  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:45):**  so that they can better serve the markets that they're trying to integrate with.  So I think that's been key for us.  Yeah, great.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:53):**  I want to come back to the industry point, but I want to hear more about business models  first.  So James, do you want to tell us kind of how the business model for Modular Farms has evolved?  
**[0:25:00-0:25:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:00):**  Yeah, no, we've definitely seen a change in our business model evolving and growing.  A lot of what we set out to do was basically provide technology systems that allows people  to grow.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:16):**  And that has very much changed to more of a model of vertically integrating and owning  that supply chain and talking to stakeholders and finding out their real specific needs  and actually addressing those needs specifically rather than trying to find a solution that  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:32):**  started out to be a one solution fits all type scenario.  And we sort of learned very quickly that wasn't going to be the case.  So we've had some really good conversations with a lot of large stakeholders around what  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:45):**  they're missing in their markets and what they're not seeing and then be able to adjust  our business and our hardware, being the farms themselves, to facilitate that change in consumer  demand.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:59):**  So yeah, we definitely have evolved and shifted our thinking around Modular Farms from two  years ago.  And has the presence and kind of large capital raises of some of the other players in other  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:13):**  markets influenced the decisions you've made?  Kind of the money flowing into Plenti and AeroFarms and some of these other big businesses,  has that influenced kind of how you guys have operated?  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:22):**  Yeah, absolutely.  When you hear stories of say $200 million being thrown at Plenti and I must admit we  have a very close relationship with one of the directors at Plenti anyway because we  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:33):**  use their technology.  So yeah, it's definitely changed our way of thinking.  And look, as we sort of touched on it before with Olympia, the idea that a factory farm  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:47):**  in every major city is going to save the world is probably a bit of a naive way to look at  things, I think.  And sorry to sound a little bit sort of drastic and pessimistic about it, but it's just not.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:59):**  So I mean, again, you're adding to already a very well-developed ecosystem.  Hydroponics has been around for decades, 100 years or so.  And it's no different than going from horse and cart to tractor.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:14):**  And you're just constantly evolving and precision agriculture now.  So it's definitely another means to be able to grow food, but it definitely has a very  long way to go, really, to be honest.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:29):**  So yeah, we definitely did change our way of thinking post a lot of these large aero  farm Plenti investments.  Great.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:37):**  And Emma, tell me about the kind of history or the story and evolution of the business  models for Aggregate and talk a little bit maybe about the alternative nature of what  you guys do and just help us understand what is really different about what you guys are  
**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:52):**  doing.  So I think that Aggregate's really fundamentally different in the fact that it's owned by two  cooperatives.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:58):**  And that brings with it some challenges, but it also brings with it some really tremendous  opportunities.  When you think about a lot of the trust issues around sharing data and data ownership and  
**[0:28:11-0:28:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:11):**  how you can build an ecosystem where farmers can derive benefits from their data, cooperatives  can play a really, really interesting role in that space.  And that's actually, our business model has changed significantly from where we started  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:30):**  because we've found ourselves in a situation of almost acting as a data broker on behalf  of our cooperative shareholders.  And I love that model because it means that we can create benefits for farmers that you  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:45):**  can only create when you've got a certain level of scale.  And all of the benefits go back to farmers, not only in terms of the revenue model, but  in terms of it's a sustainable way of funding the development of the tools and resources  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:57):**  that they need to lift their performance.  And it's been a really eye-opening experience for me personally.  So for example, we have a lot of challenges in New Zealand where the regulatory framework  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:15):**  is evolving, but farmers have to submit a great deal of information to regional councils  and to their milk cooperatives and so on and so forth.  So even just enabling data to flow from one system to another seamlessly and to be able  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:27):**  to manage all of the complex mappings that farmers set their farms up in all sorts of  different ways.  They might have their good cows in one herd and their other cows in another herd.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:36):**  And they run a whole lot of different types of arrangements in their data that if you  can actually capture that, you can do a heap of stuff with it and create a lot of value  for other players in the supply chain.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:49):**  So sharing it with their rural consultants, enabling their banks to have better visibility  of what's going on.  In New Zealand there's been a huge shift in the accountancy practice from doing compliance  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:01):**  work to more advisory work and so positioning themselves as virtual CFOs for farms and that  type of thing.  So there's an entire business model around aggregate that never existed two years ago  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:13):**  that's just come from discovering where the real problems are in the data network.  Great.  Just a heads up, I'll come to the audience soon for questions.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:23):**  So get thinking about what you might ask and if you do have anything burning, send it through  the app because it is an interactive session.  I want to come back to the point about industry and how we go from having these alternative  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:35):**  farming systems to making them mainstream and having them become an actual industry  that exists.  One barrier you touched on before is scale and then getting to scale.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:44):**  I imagine there's others.  So curious to hear how we go from alternative to maybe next year or in a few years at Evoke  we'll be talking about different alternative farming systems because these ones will be  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:54):**  mainstream.  Gerard, you want to start?  Well that's a huge challenge.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:00):**  Trying to convince the developed world to consume insects, that's almost impossible  when you look at it.  But sometimes you have luck.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:10):**  You need some luck.  And about three years after we started the project, we actually saw the traditional industry,  food industry starting to get into this new arena.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:21):**  And we already can see and we know that companies like PepsiCo already have Doritos with insect  protein and Nestle are working on porridges with insect protein.  And the Seattle Mariners serve whole ready to eat grasshoppers at the ballpark and IKEA  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:37):**  announced that they will replace the traditional Swedish meatballs all over the world at the  restaurants from beef to insects.  So actually for the startup, this is amazing because this is the greatest challenge and  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:52):**  we have very good friends that really assist us.  Great.  James?  
**[0:31:58-0:32:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:58):**  Yeah, basically getting from a great idea to a mainstream business is rather difficult  and takes time.  But I think the simple factor in our industry would be a very financial term and that's  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:32:14):**  just balancing your OpEx and CapEx and then finding a market that's willing to pay for  what you've got.  So it's one of those things that we've found specifically that to go from just a single  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:32:32):**  farm to having say 30 or 40 farms on the ground, it's really going to be dependent upon not  only the technology changes that happens internally with our systems and it's definitely our system  alone has changed drastically since two years ago to now in terms of what we do inside the  
**[0:32:50-0:32:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:32:50):**  farm.  So that alone has saved us a considerable amount of money and that will obviously continue  and then that will sort of drive our costs down and then allows us to create a more palatable  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:03):**  product price point and market.  Emma, do you see the evolution of more cooperatives?  Do you think that more companies will look to set up cooperative structures and around  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:15):**  this kind of data management issue?  Do you think this is a trend that will become more mainstream in New Zealand but also elsewhere?  That's a tough question.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:23):**  Now, co-ops are under pressure in most places in the world but yeah, it's a tough question.  I think that there are a lot of benefits in exploring some of the issues that we're exploring  now.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:37):**  I think to your previous question around how does some of the alternative become mainstream  and I think data-enabled farming being part of that alternative, I think it really comes  back to your point around the diversity of food systems and it's actually relatively  
**[0:33:51-0:33:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:51):**  recent that we have had less diverse food systems than we've had in the past.  Farmers will respond to what economically makes sense within the constraints that they're  facing and if we can highlight those constraints and highlight the opportunities, that is the  
**[0:34:11-0:34:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:11):**  pathway to adoption of alternatives or more diverse types of farm systems, in my opinion.  Olympia, anything to add?  We're good?  
**[0:34:22-0:34:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:22):**  Great.  So I wanted to turn to the audience and I'm particularly curious for the producers that  raised their hand earlier, kind of how you or if you have any questions or comments on  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:32):**  how you see these alternative models evolving in contrast or in addition to the production  systems that you guys are using and are familiar with.  Any questions or comments?  
**[0:34:45-0:34:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:45):**  Everyone's just waiting for lunch?  Happy to sit there.  Yeah, come up to the mic please if you don't mind.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:55):**  And if you could just say your name please first.  Mark Shepherd from AgResearch in New Zealand.  Got questions for everybody but I'll just take one question.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:35:05):**  That's around data sharing, data ownership, trust, everybody getting value out of it,  it's been a theme here already and every meeting you go to, that's a big issue.  So question for Emma about is the advantage that you've got from your two cooperatives  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:35:19):**  that you already own a lot of data, that you are able to combine with other data sets and  extract value from those and share data with other actors in that production chain or are  you really just focusing on your own data that you own?  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:35:37):**  So I think what having two big data sets to start with helps out with is that you can  put other data in context and that is important.  So if you're wanting to understand for example how productive or how profitable somebody  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:35:49):**  is, it's really important to understand how that looks across the entire production base  to say well you might be in the top 20% of the top 20% without that bigger data set,  you actually need the scope.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:04):**  But yeah, the idea is to bring as much data together as we possibly can to kind of start  to free up the insights.  It's not about anyone in particular owning the insights or owning the kind of new ideas,  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:17):**  it's about saying how do we get the data working in a way that people can innovate on it, including  AgriSearch hopefully.  Any other questions?  
**[0:36:31-0:36:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:31):**  Bridget Unsworth from New Zealand Venture Investment Fund.  Sorry, can you just make sure it's really close to your mouth, it's a bit hard to hear.  Bridget Unsworth from New Zealand Venture Investment Fund.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:38):**  I love this concept of endurability as opposed to sustainability and I hadn't kind of thought  of it like that and I also like the discussion you had around new farming practices need  to sit alongside traditional farming practices.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:52):**  So I guess the question to the entire panel is how do you negotiate the tensions between  old farming practices with the new farming practices that you're trying to sort of integrate  and how do you integrate to become I guess a cohesive whole in the supply chain or the  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:37:05):**  value chain and the in product that you're offering?  So for me it came down to like who the heck we thought we were.  So I think the challenge is like you go, we're Go Terra, we manage food waste in Maggot Robots,  
**[0:37:23-0:37:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:37:23):**  that's cool but what does that actually mean and what is food waste and so you start to  like there's we know we think we know what that is but the more you talk and the more  you speak to people the different things.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:37:36):**  So I could have six pork producers in this room and each of one of them has effluent  as their waste but that effluent will be different because someone's running it off the back  of a methane gas capture, someone's hosing down one way, someone likes to settle pot.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:37:54):**  So my job then is to decide am I really a solution or can I only be a solution for one  human.  And our decision was that we were going to be our solution, period.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:08):**  And that meant then that our tech had to be adaptable to the need of our client and it  also meant that we had to broaden our thoughts outside of just Maggots.  So we're like okay now if we're going to manage food waste, maybe it's not just a black soldier  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:26):**  fly anymore because I also want to manage the 10,000 litres of chocolate ice cream that  Pixie does up in Toowoomba.  Black soldier fly won't eat that but a house fly will.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:37):**  So can they live in my tech?  And so it's like are you delivering a service truly or are you only going to do it in this  sort of proprietary way?  
**[0:38:48-0:38:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:48):**  I want to do it in an agnostic way.  So what have you got?  Do I have the insects that can manage it?  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:54):**  Can my tech manage those insects?  Sweet, we have a deal.  And that means, not to get too into it, but we also have a dry feed system of that robot  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:05):**  that can handle dried agricultural waste, scrape mark, so that we can raise insects  for human consumption.  And so, but I'm still managing waste, it's just a little bit different.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:16):**  And I think every business is trying to do that in one way or another.  But I think when you really can find your way into integration of ecosystems, you have  to stop thinking more about like, oh well I'm sorry I can only be this and more about  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:33):**  well if we only tweak two things maybe we can still do that.  So it's just about that.  Any other comments on how to kind of sit and integrate with existing farming systems?  
**[0:39:43-0:39:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:43):**  Yeah, look, I mean, we don't, again, we don't really see ourselves separate from the traditional  farmers.  We see ourselves as part of the industry from a traditional point of view.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:59):**  What we're able to do is obviously provide a solution, a bit like we were just saying,  look at the issues at hand.  Can they grow food in Birdsville?  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:12):**  Is that even possible?  All right, can what we do do that and provide what they need?  And some of the time it may not be that they want food in Birdsville or fresh lettuce or  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:22):**  leafy greens or herbs or they don't want a whole farm that just does one product and  want a farm that does multiple products.  And what does that mean?  
**[0:40:30-0:40:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:30):**  What do we tweak to be able to achieve that?  So yes, you're constantly trying to integrate with the surrounding industry.  And I mean, yeah, by no means do you think that you're going to be the one solution in  
**[0:40:44-0:40:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:44):**  any case.  So that's what we've seen with a lot of the research that we've done, especially in far  north Queensland, that our system definitely needs to alter for many different cases.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:01):**  Not greatly, but you definitely need to adjust certain things to be able to achieve what  the desired result may be.  Great.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:09):**  I think we have time for maybe one or two more questions.  I'm Harvey Gaynor.  James, you mentioned the high energy usage in your farm compared to field production.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:25):**  But I wonder about the energy savings from transport from field to market and transport  of inputs, that sort of thing.  Can you talk to us a bit about what you know about that balance and that comparison?  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:37):**  Because it's something that producers are under more scrutiny for, the whole life cycle  sort of analysis.  And maybe some of the other production systems, what you're seeing with the insects and other  
**[0:41:46-0:41:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:46):**  things as well.  Yeah.  I mean, we haven't specifically conducted a huge amount of research in, say, costing  
**[0:41:54-0:42:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:54):**  out the energy used on a traditional acre of land to grow iceberg lettuce.  Our system itself, particularly in any indoor farm, whether it's plenty, aero farms, freight  farms, crop box, all of us, the elephant in the room is that we use a lot of energy.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:42:14):**  Now, that technology in LED has drastically changed from five years ago, 10 years ago,  to today.  Even our system alone has saved probably in the last six months 40% energy consumption.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:42:28):**  So that's just through the development of technology.  Now, from a sustainable sort of renewable energy source and developing a true off-grid  solution where we don't need to rely on anything to do with the grid, what we've realized and  
**[0:42:44-0:42:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:42:44):**  what we've researched and done in our own space, our one solution is not going to work.  So it's going to be a combination of wind, solar, and battery, and even biodigesters  that are turning food waste into power.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:00):**  So those technologies are all great, but they too also have a cost to them.  And it depends on your local market.  Again, if you're only producing a small quantity, a sort of a micro economy of produce, then  
**[0:43:13-0:43:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:13):**  it may not be worth you spending $80,000 to set up an off-grid system with a payback of,  say, five or six years.  So definitely the economics has to play into it.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:26):**  But yeah, I would love to one day see some real serious research done around the cost  inputs of, say, diesel on a tractor and implements and the cost of making that implement versus  how that translates into the energy consumption of an indoor farm.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:44):**  Yeah, I just don't have the answer, but I'd love to know if anyone does.  Great.  So that's all we have time for.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:50):**  I was going to summarize insights and ask a kind of final reflection question, but I  won't hold you guys up for lunch.  The one thing I will say that was really a big takeaway for me was this kind of indurability  
**[0:44:00-0:44:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:44:00):**  concept and how these alternative systems need to work in conjunction with and so that  we can have a diverse food system that serves the needs of consumers and investors and farmers.  So I think it's a really positive message that's probably echoed throughout this conference  
**[0:44:15-0:44:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:44:15):**  yesterday and today.  So please join me in thanking the panelists.  Thank you for joining us on another episode of Ag Tech.

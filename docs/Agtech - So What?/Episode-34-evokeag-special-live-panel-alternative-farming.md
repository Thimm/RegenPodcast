### Agtech - So What?  (Sun, 03 Mar 2019 20:14:53)
**[0:00:00-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly changing  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:00:25):**  the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting started.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:00:30):**  But there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between ag and  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:00:35):**  ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring you the  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:00:39):**  story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where ag and tech  
**[0:00:44-0:01:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:00:44):**  meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. Hello, everyone. Oh, everyone's here now. This is  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:01:09):**  awesome. I'm Sarah Nolette. I'm the founder of Agfentik. We're an innovation advisory  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:01:13):**  firm in the agri-food sector here in Australia and in the US. And I'm really thrilled to  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:01:18):**  be moderating this session because it's one of my favorite topics. And I imagine it's  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:01:22):**  a good one for you guys as well. Before I bring up the panelists, I'm going to make  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:01:26):**  you guys do a little bit of work. Can you guys tell me a little bit about who you are?  
**[0:01:30-0:01:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:01:30):**  So raise your hand if you're an entrepreneur. Investor. Farmer. What are we missing? Researcher.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:01:42):**  Nonprofit. No? Okay, great. So a really good mix and really interested to hear some questions  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:01:49):**  from you guys. It's an interactive session, so you'll be able to use the app as well  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:01:53):**  as come up and ask questions via the microphone. So I'd like to welcome to the stage the panelists.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:01:58):**  This is obviously a range of perspectives from insects to indoor farms to cooperative  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:02:04):**  dairy farms. So we'll cover quite a bit of ground here, all focused around feeding the  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:02:08):**  future and doing so in ways that aren't exactly like the conventional, traditional agricultural  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:02:13):**  systems. So I won't do too much on the panelists. I'll let them introduce themselves. So why  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:02:17):**  don't I have all of you guys actually just come up to the stage. Please help me welcome  
**[0:02:21-0:02:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:02:21):**  them. So you guys can read more about them in the program and I'm sure all over social  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:02:34):**  media and the brochures, but I'll have you guys each do a quick sort of 30 second intro  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:02:40):**  on yourselves and a little bit about your companies. Dror, do you want to start? Sure,  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:02:45):**  thank you. Shalom, my name is Dror Tamir. I'm from Israel and I'm the co-founder and  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:02:50):**  CEO of Hargol Food Tech and we are the first in the world to grow grasshoppers on commercial  
**[0:02:56-0:03:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:02:56):**  scale. Grasshoppers are nature's most efficient protein source. Thank you. Great. James? James  
**[0:03:04-0:03:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:03:04):**  Pataris, Modular Farms. We build modular containerised farming systems using vertical hydroponics.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:03:11):**  Kia ora, I'm Emma Parsons. I'm from Aggregate, which is a joint venture between two of New  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:03:18):**  Zealand's largest dairy cooperatives, Fonterra and Livestock Improvement Corporation. We're  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:03:24):**  a data platform that brings the rich data sets from the New Zealand dairy industry together  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:03:30):**  to help provide new insights for farmers so that they can become more sustainable and  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:03:34):**  profitable. My name is Olympia Yaga. I'm the founder and CEO of GoTerra. We manage food  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:03:40):**  waste in maggot robots. Well done. I think that was the first panel introduction that  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:03:44):**  kept everyone under 30 seconds, so we're off to a good start. I want to go back through  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:03:48):**  everyone and just have you tell the origin story of your company. So how did you get  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:03:54):**  involved in what you're doing and how did the company actually start? We'll go the reverse  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:03:57):**  order this time. I started in conventional agriculture and I left and went to the US  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:04:02):**  for a while. Tried to come back to go back to agriculture and the cost of entry was too  
**[0:04:08-0:04:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:04:08):**  high. So started looking at alternate feed opportunities, found insects and yeah, maggots  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:04:17):**  in my kitchen and now maggots in a warehouse. It's a logical progression obviously. We might  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:04:23):**  have to come back. There's some questions there I think, but we'll keep going for now.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:04:27):**  Emma? So I'm from a dairy farm originally. I grew up in South Taranaki in New Zealand  
**[0:04:34-0:04:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:04:34):**  and my father is an ecologist, so I sort of developed a real love of the land and a love  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:04:41):**  of agriculture and in a biodiversity in particularly since I was very, very young. And throughout  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:04:47):**  my career in the dairy industry, I've focused on that in different ways and I've sort of  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:04:53):**  thought about it from the perspective that sustainability for farmers is highly related  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:04:58):**  to building capability and to do that you need to know where you are now and what good  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:05:02):**  looks like. And so aggregate, the genesis of aggregate is based around that, which is  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:05:09):**  that we know all of this information about what good looks like. If we can get really,  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:05:14):**  really granular insights for farmers about where they are currently today and what the  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:05:18):**  opportunity is for them, we can highlight those profitability shifts and sustainability shifts.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:05:24):**  So we're very lucky in New Zealand from the richness of the data that's existed from decades  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:05:28):**  and decades of cooperatives and so it's an amazing opportunity to be able to leverage that.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:05:34):**  Great. James? Cool. So a bit about my background. I grew up in western Victoria on a vegetable  
**[0:05:41-0:05:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:05:41):**  farm out there, broadacre. Went through a severe drought sometime in the early 2000s.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:05:48):**  Realised that what my grandfather and father have gone through over the past 50 years,  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:05:54):**  60 years was not going to be sustainable going forward. So found myself getting involved  
**[0:05:59-0:06:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:05:59):**  with hydroponics but then more so small systems like containerised farming and yeah, found  
**[0:06:08-0:06:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:06:08):**  myself working at modular farms and developing our system over here and in Canada.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:06:19):**  I was born in the kibbutz. My grandfather was the chairman of that kibbutz and he established  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:06:24):**  two facilities. One is called Galam, the largest corn processor in Israel. He was also the  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:06:30):**  CEO of that company and Ambar. Ambar is the largest feed producer in Israel. So you can  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:06:35):**  understand that I have some connection to agriculture and food but the main connection  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:06:41):**  actually came from my grandmother because she was the cook of the kibbutz. Another thing  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:06:45):**  that happened in those years when I was really young in the kibbutz, they used to tell me  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:06:48):**  stories about the 1950s when Israel suffered from locust swarms that came and ate all the  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:06:53):**  crops. They used to go out to the fields, try to scare the grasshoppers away and they  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:06:58):**  saw other people coming into those fields collecting the grasshoppers and eating them.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:07:03):**  So I learned that grasshoppers are both food and are kosher. 30 years later, when I was  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:07:10):**  looking for alternative protein, the answer was waiting for me already.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:07:15):**  Great. So one of the themes that gets talked about a lot in the alternative farming space  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:07:21):**  is sustainability and the potential of these new farming systems to improve the sustainability.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:07:26):**  I'm curious how much is that a part of your business and part of your personal mission  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:07:31):**  in what you're doing in the company? So, Emma, I might start with you.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:07:35):**  Thanks. So, I mean, it's completely fundamental to me personally. I think that all value in  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:07:42):**  our economy ultimately stems from the environment and the relationships that we have with our  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:07:49):**  natural environment. And I think farmers probably feel that much more keenly than some others  
**[0:07:55-0:08:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:07:55):**  in our society. I think that we live a lot closer to the land. So it's such a part of  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:08:04):**  the fabric of our communities in New Zealand as well. And it's also under a lot of pressure.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:08:09):**  Obviously, natural resource constraints and regulation are really important forces at  
**[0:08:16-0:08:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:08:16):**  play for farmers. And so anything that we can do to accelerate the transition and enable  
**[0:08:25-0:08:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:08:25):**  that transition to happen in a way that is supportive and empowering for farmers, I think  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:08:32):**  is really important. So it's absolutely fundamental to everything that that aggregate is doing.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:08:38):**  Great. I want to kind of pull on that thread a little bit around the role of farmers. And  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:08:43):**  when we talk about alternative farming systems, it's often sort of in contrast to conventional  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:08:48):**  farming systems and almost in kind of conflict with them. And I wonder to what degree you  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:08:53):**  see that as true. And is it sort of we move to this alternative model? Is it a slow transition?  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:08:58):**  And what is the kind of role of today's farmers in the future systems that you guys are building?  
**[0:09:04-0:09:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:09:04):**  Anyone want to volunteer?  
**[0:09:06-0:09:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:09:06):**  I think it's an interesting conversation because it's particularly in the insect side, when  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:09:13):**  the general narrative in insect farming is that insects are more sustainable because  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:09:17):**  they're smaller and we use less feed. And that just to me actually translates more into  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:09:23):**  that it'll just take a little longer for us to run out, right? And so it's more about  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:09:28):**  in durability of your system and how it fits into the ecosystem. And so when we look at  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:09:35):**  it from Gautera's perspective, so yes, we manage waste, but where do we fit into an  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:09:42):**  ecosystem? So I don't subscribe to the mentality that insect protein will stop us overfishing  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:09:49):**  the oceans and or save us from soy. But I do believe that insects have a role to play  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:09:56):**  integrated into the existing conventional ecosystem. And so from the Insect Protein  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:10:03):**  Association's point of view, when we talk about sustainability, we say things like,  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:10:09):**  where do insects fit in existing farming models? And so we speak a lot to farmers who are looking  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:10:15):**  to drought-proof their industries by bringing insects for food production onto their farms  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:10:21):**  because insects require far less water, 400 milliliters per kilo of protein produced,  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:10:27):**  far less arable land, far less input. Some of them don't require sunlight. And so can  
**[0:10:34-0:10:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:10:34):**  we integrate an additional type of production system to existing production systems? That  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:10:43):**  to me is more about sustainability because it includes the conversation of endurability  
**[0:10:48-0:10:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:10:48):**  and the capability of farmers to sustain their production capability, not necessarily whether  
**[0:10:56-0:11:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:10:56):**  or not by farming mealworms I will be able to farm them forever. I think that's more  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:11:03):**  important. Right. Go ahead, James. I probably want to speak a bit about the sustainability  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:11:07):**  side of things and I agree with you, Olympia. I think being the only sort of indoor farming  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:11:13):**  speaker here on the panel, it would be naive to say that we're a sustainable solution because  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:11:19):**  we use so much power. One of the things that we are able to do is provide efficiencies  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:11:25):**  in other things like resources like water or nutrient delivery or better plant health.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:11:31):**  So I mean, one of the misconceiving things about indoor farming is that it's going to  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:11:37):**  be feeding the world or it's the future. It's definitely another cog in the wheel and it's  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:11:43):**  definitely another platform that we can grow food with. But yeah, I sort of agree. I mean,  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:11:48):**  I think there's always going to be a place for precision agriculture in the field as  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:11:54):**  well as a factory being built as a farm or a container being placed in rural isolated  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:12:00):**  Australia feeding a small town creating a micro economy. So yeah, I think sustainability  
**[0:12:05-0:12:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:12:05):**  is a very widely used term but I think it sort of lacks a real definition. Yep, might  
**[0:12:13-0:12:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:12:13):**  fall off the stage. Not a good idea. I want to ask about the perceptions of alternative  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:12:21):**  farming and both from potential investors in the company, from consumers of your product,  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:12:26):**  how have you managed the narrative and the marketing and the perceptions around being  
**[0:12:31-0:12:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:12:31):**  an alternative? Well, perception of alternative farming, when we talk about trying to convince  
**[0:12:38-0:12:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:12:38):**  a developed world investor to invest in a grasshopper farm. Five years ago when we started,  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:12:45):**  the response was you're disgusting, you're strange, you're weird. I think the only compliment  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:12:51):**  was you're just too exotic for us. So it's not about eating the insects, not perception  
**[0:12:58-0:13:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:12:58):**  of insects, it's the perception of the business and it was really hard and I think what worked  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:13:06):**  for us in Israel was something that we call Tikkun Olam, that's in the Jewish tradition,  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:13:11):**  in the Israeli tradition. Tikkun Olam means make the world a better place and it means  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:13:17):**  that we're not supposed to think only about ourselves, we need to think about everyone  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:13:21):**  around the world, how we can make their world a better place and when we looked at that,  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:13:26):**  we learned that 2.5 billion people across the world eat insects as part of their diet,  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:13:32):**  but today they collect them in the wild and this means it is very expensive, the quality  
**[0:13:38-0:13:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:13:38):**  is not good and the availability is very limited to about four to six weeks a year and once  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:13:45):**  we understood that and this is completely out of the box because I never ate grasshoppers  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:13:50):**  or insects before, we learned that there's a huge potential and then we started getting  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:13:55):**  some investors.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:13:56):**  Interesting. Did you want to add to that?  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:14:01):**  In Australia, the insects, just to talk a bit more about the insect part, the challenge  
**[0:14:07-0:14:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:14:07):**  was the story of sustainability and this magic bullet to save the world was coming and insects  
**[0:14:15-0:14:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:14:15):**  were it, but we were ignoring in a sales way the fact that across the board alternative  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:14:23):**  farming solutions have been promising now for a decade to solve this massive problem  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:14:29):**  and hadn't delivered and certainly when you look at insects, there are about six big insect  
**[0:14:34-0:14:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:14:34):**  farms in the world and they're mostly in Europe and America, so one in South Africa and between  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:14:43):**  them they've all raised about $300 million, it's between six of them and none of them  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:14:49):**  have delivered on the metric tonnage that they promised and on top of that, some of  
**[0:14:56-0:15:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:14:56):**  them still will not announce their production capability and when that happens, alternate  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:05):**  opportunities start to diminish their credibility because the sales pitch is not meeting the  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:10):**  delivery and so in Australia, the challenge for us when we were looking at investors was  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:17):**  to first get in the door because we were an insect farm, they immediately thought that  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:22):**  we were there to talk about protein, so we had to sort of talk about the fact that we  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:28):**  were trying to deliver a completely different solution altogether that stepped out of that  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:32):**  very investor speak world.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:35):**  It raises an interesting issue around transparency and the transparency in the insect industry,  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:41):**  but also the consumer desire for transparency and how that's driving some of the investment  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:46):**  and innovation in this space.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:47):**  Emma, do you want to touch a little bit on transparency and how that plays a role in  
**[0:15:51-0:15:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:51):**  aggregate?  
**[0:15:52-0:15:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:52):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:15:53-0:16:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:15:53):**  So Fonterra, which is one of the partners of aggregate, is a large dairy exporter out  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:16:00):**  of New Zealand and services all of the global markets.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:16:05):**  There's a great deal of demand for transparency, particularly at this point in time around  
**[0:16:09-0:16:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:16:09):**  food safety and quality, but that will extend and is extending into animal welfare, into  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:16:17):**  environmental performance and what's the environmental footprint of the product, into things like  
**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:16:23):**  biosecurity, so that the full kind of gambit of attributes of a product and we hear a lot  
**[0:16:30-0:16:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:16:30):**  around increasingly personalised nutrition and people seek proof points around how is  
**[0:16:39-0:16:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:16:39):**  this nutrition different for me physically, but also how is it different for me from an  
**[0:16:45-0:16:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:16:45):**  ethical perspective.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:16:46):**  So to enable any of those things to occur in any real way, there's a huge transformation  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:16:52):**  in data collection and data aggregation that's actually required in all of our food systems.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:16:58):**  It's really surprised me now, the more that I understand about it, actually just where  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:04):**  the gaps are in information about how food's produced and we've got some good regulatory  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:08):**  frameworks but they're not at all comprehensive enough, they don't cover all of the aspects  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:14):**  that consumers are increasingly interested in and so there's this really interesting  
**[0:17:19-0:17:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:19):**  kind of pinch point for farmers which is in some aspects they're adopting these technologies  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:26):**  for farm performance, but actually it's that information that will drive value through  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:31):**  the value chain further down the track.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:33):**  So I think that it's an absolutely fundamental, it will form a fundamental piece of your brand  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:40):**  proposition for any food product that you're selling in the very near future.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:45):**  Interesting.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:46):**  James, I want you to comment on this as well, but I guess just to push a little bit, I think  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:51):**  there's a lot of talk around we want transparency, we want to know where everything comes from  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:55):**  and I'm not actually sure that that's true in all cases and people are busy and when  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:17:59):**  they're shopping they don't want to read about a farm for 20 minutes before they buy a loaf  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:04):**  of bread, so I'm curious I guess to just go a little deeper and now you're up for the  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:08):**  challenge James, around do consumers really want this and from a business model perspective  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:14):**  as a farm, how do you think about that?  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:16):**  Yeah, good question.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:18):**  I think the transparency side of things and going into that, one of the misconceiving  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:25):**  things that we found in our industry when it was born, it was sort of all about growing  
**[0:18:30-0:18:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:30):**  the most in the small space.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:32):**  There's nothing really concentrated on about food quality, uniformity in plants and health  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:38):**  of plants, it was just about how can we fit the most in the small space.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:43):**  What we've seen now is that that is not going to always work in any market.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:48):**  A lot of what we did here in Australia, we actually conducted a lot of market research  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:53):**  in areas that we felt the modular farm will suit best, so rural and isolated specifically  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:18:58):**  because we felt the urban environment was so saturated with product that we were never  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:19:03):**  going to be able to compete on a cost basis.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:19:07):**  And you're absolutely right, people aren't prepared to sit there reading a blurb for  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:19:11):**  about 30 minutes on where the providence of the food or where it's come from, they just  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:19:16):**  want to know it's clean, healthy and potentially has no pesticides or chemicals.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:19:22):**  So for us, we've had to change our model a lot in terms of our business case and really  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:19:29):**  evolve in terms of offering consumers something that's more palatable in terms of a product  
**[0:19:34-0:19:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:19:34):**  because us selling a $3 lettuce is not going to be sustainable in the long run for a business  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:19:41):**  model.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:19:43):**  So we've seen our business change a fair bit in terms of who we're supplying and the customers  
**[0:19:49-0:19:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:19:49):**  we're supplying and a lot of it does, I mean having to grow food in a box is not cheap  
**[0:19:57-0:20:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:19:57):**  but there is definitely a lot of value in local food, clean food and that food security.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:05):**  So we do know through our research that we can actually obtain a more of a premium price  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:11):**  on product with those factors involved in it.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:15):**  You touched a little bit on the changes you've needed to make to respond to that.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:19):**  I think it's a really interesting question in alternative farming especially, the different  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:23):**  business models and we heard from AeroFarms yesterday and plenty has been mentioned and  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:28):**  there's other insect farms out there and do you control the whole supply chain, do you  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:32):**  sell the technology, do you sell the branded product, do you try to do it all, where do  
**[0:20:36-0:20:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:36):**  you fit and what business model you actually adopt.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:38):**  I'm curious how you guys have tried to crack that nut and maybe a story or the kind of  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:44):**  narrative around how it's changed.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:45):**  Dror, do you want to start?  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:47):**  Sure, well I just said that there is very high demand for grasshoppers all over Africa,  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:53):**  try to raise funds to build the grasshopper farm in Israel and serve Africa.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:20:59):**  Probably you will get nothing, you will not be able to raise any money.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:03):**  So we had to change the business model and try to focus on a different customer first  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:07):**  to raise the money.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:09):**  So we changed it to the US and Europe and this helped us raise money, as simple as that.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:16):**  Right, so it was just a geographical change.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:18):**  That's one of them, I have many other examples like that but you have to be flexible and  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:25):**  you have to understand how to talk to your customer, if your customer is the actual customer  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:31):**  that buys the product, if your customer is the investor that is looking for an investment  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:36):**  that will be as close as possible to their own field, you have to be flexible.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:42):**  Just to push a little further, can you give an example of how you maybe talk to an investor  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:46):**  different or how you would pitch this to an investor different than a consumer?  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:51):**  Well with consumer, you can't tell the entire story.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:54):**  With investor, you have a few more minutes that you can do that.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:21:59):**  You can't tell the consumer that these are the most widely eaten insects in the world,  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:05):**  you can't tell them the story that this is actually part of everyone's history.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:10):**  They are mentioned in the Bible, 3000 years old food, they are kosher, they are mentioned  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:15):**  in the Quran, they are mentioned in the New Testament, John the Baptist used to eat grass  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:19):**  hoppers with honey.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:20):**  There's a lot of stories behind the product and there's a lot of opportunities but eventually  
**[0:22:25-0:22:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:25):**  if someone goes into Sainsbury in the UK and he sees that product, you have three seconds.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:32):**  So you have very limited time and you have to make your decision.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:36):**  Are you going to talk about sustainability?  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:38):**  Are you going to talk about the health benefits?  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:41):**  Maybe you're going to talk just about price.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:43):**  Sure.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:44):**  Olympia, do you want to talk a little bit about business model evolution for GoTerra?  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:48):**  Yeah, so I started protein, we were going to make protein save the world and that was  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:54):**  a really great idea.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:22:56):**  So the more our colony grew and the bigger it got, I realised that the amount of food  
**[0:23:05-0:23:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:23:05):**  waste I would need to make livestock feed from maggots was just not, it didn't make  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:23:13):**  sense.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:23:14):**  So you need 25 tonnes of waste to make one tonne of protein and that's astronomical when  
**[0:23:20-0:23:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:23:20):**  you consider that most of our waste, 60% of all food waste comes out of households.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:23:26):**  So I think for us it was pretty pivotal to, once I started seeing those numbers, it just  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:23:32):**  didn't make sense.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:23:34):**  So we flipped and became a fee for service system that charges for waste management and  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:23:41):**  just happens to also make a protein on the backside.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:23:45):**  That was super compelling to our investors because again it comes back to that in durability.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:23:50):**  That can endure.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:23:52):**  That means that because we aren't focused on the size of our colony to make protein,  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:23:58):**  we can just focus on managing waste streams effectively and efficiently and then that  
**[0:24:03-0:24:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:03):**  means that we have a place in this ecosystem to create enough protein to start selling  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:10):**  into even the pet food market was never going, like you're looking at thousands of tonnes  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:16):**  a month, which is 25,000 tonnes of food waste.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:22):**  It's already been consumed with other alternate farming systems.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:26):**  So I think for us it just always comes back to that ecosystem where alternative farming  
**[0:24:31-0:24:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:31):**  ideas can't exist in silos.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:34):**  They have to be a great idea that then integrates with their stakeholders, the industry.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:40):**  They need to become an industry of their own and through that develop the best practice  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:45):**  so that they can better serve the markets that they're trying to integrate with.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:50):**  So I think that's been key for us.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:52):**  Yeah, great.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:53):**  I want to come back to the industry point, but I want to hear more about business models  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:55):**  first.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:24:56):**  So James, do you want to tell us kind of how the business model for Modular Farms has evolved?  
**[0:25:00-0:25:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:00):**  Yeah, no, we've definitely seen a change in our business model evolving and growing.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:09):**  A lot of what we set out to do was basically provide technology systems that allows people  
**[0:25:15-0:25:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:15):**  to grow.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:16):**  And that has very much changed to more of a model of vertically integrating and owning  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:21):**  that supply chain and talking to stakeholders and finding out their real specific needs  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:26):**  and actually addressing those needs specifically rather than trying to find a solution that  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:32):**  started out to be a one solution fits all type scenario.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:36):**  And we sort of learned very quickly that wasn't going to be the case.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:39):**  So we've had some really good conversations with a lot of large stakeholders around what  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:45):**  they're missing in their markets and what they're not seeing and then be able to adjust  
**[0:25:50-0:25:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:50):**  our business and our hardware, being the farms themselves, to facilitate that change in consumer  
**[0:25:58-0:25:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:58):**  demand.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:25:59):**  So yeah, we definitely have evolved and shifted our thinking around Modular Farms from two  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:07):**  years ago.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:09):**  And has the presence and kind of large capital raises of some of the other players in other  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:13):**  markets influenced the decisions you've made?  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:15):**  Kind of the money flowing into Plenti and AeroFarms and some of these other big businesses,  
**[0:26:20-0:26:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:20):**  has that influenced kind of how you guys have operated?  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:22):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:23):**  When you hear stories of say $200 million being thrown at Plenti and I must admit we  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:29):**  have a very close relationship with one of the directors at Plenti anyway because we  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:33):**  use their technology.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:35):**  So yeah, it's definitely changed our way of thinking.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:40):**  And look, as we sort of touched on it before with Olympia, the idea that a factory farm  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:47):**  in every major city is going to save the world is probably a bit of a naive way to look at  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:52):**  things, I think.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:53):**  And sorry to sound a little bit sort of drastic and pessimistic about it, but it's just not.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:26:59):**  So I mean, again, you're adding to already a very well-developed ecosystem.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:07):**  Hydroponics has been around for decades, 100 years or so.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:11):**  And it's no different than going from horse and cart to tractor.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:14):**  And you're just constantly evolving and precision agriculture now.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:18):**  So it's definitely another means to be able to grow food, but it definitely has a very  
**[0:27:27-0:27:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:27):**  long way to go, really, to be honest.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:29):**  So yeah, we definitely did change our way of thinking post a lot of these large aero  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:34):**  farm Plenti investments.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:36):**  Great.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:37):**  And Emma, tell me about the kind of history or the story and evolution of the business  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:41):**  models for Aggregate and talk a little bit maybe about the alternative nature of what  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:47):**  you guys do and just help us understand what is really different about what you guys are  
**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:52):**  doing.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:53):**  So I think that Aggregate's really fundamentally different in the fact that it's owned by two  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:57):**  cooperatives.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:27:58):**  And that brings with it some challenges, but it also brings with it some really tremendous  
**[0:28:04-0:28:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:04):**  opportunities.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:05):**  When you think about a lot of the trust issues around sharing data and data ownership and  
**[0:28:11-0:28:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:11):**  how you can build an ecosystem where farmers can derive benefits from their data, cooperatives  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:19):**  can play a really, really interesting role in that space.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:23):**  And that's actually, our business model has changed significantly from where we started  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:30):**  because we've found ourselves in a situation of almost acting as a data broker on behalf  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:35):**  of our cooperative shareholders.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:39):**  And I love that model because it means that we can create benefits for farmers that you  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:45):**  can only create when you've got a certain level of scale.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:48):**  And all of the benefits go back to farmers, not only in terms of the revenue model, but  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:52):**  in terms of it's a sustainable way of funding the development of the tools and resources  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:57):**  that they need to lift their performance.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:28:59):**  And it's been a really eye-opening experience for me personally.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:07):**  So for example, we have a lot of challenges in New Zealand where the regulatory framework  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:15):**  is evolving, but farmers have to submit a great deal of information to regional councils  
**[0:29:18-0:29:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:18):**  and to their milk cooperatives and so on and so forth.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:21):**  So even just enabling data to flow from one system to another seamlessly and to be able  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:27):**  to manage all of the complex mappings that farmers set their farms up in all sorts of  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:31):**  different ways.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:32):**  They might have their good cows in one herd and their other cows in another herd.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:36):**  And they run a whole lot of different types of arrangements in their data that if you  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:43):**  can actually capture that, you can do a heap of stuff with it and create a lot of value  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:48):**  for other players in the supply chain.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:49):**  So sharing it with their rural consultants, enabling their banks to have better visibility  
**[0:29:53-0:29:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:53):**  of what's going on.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:29:55):**  In New Zealand there's been a huge shift in the accountancy practice from doing compliance  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:01):**  work to more advisory work and so positioning themselves as virtual CFOs for farms and that  
**[0:30:06-0:30:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:06):**  type of thing.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:07):**  So there's an entire business model around aggregate that never existed two years ago  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:13):**  that's just come from discovering where the real problems are in the data network.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:18):**  Great.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:19):**  Just a heads up, I'll come to the audience soon for questions.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:23):**  So get thinking about what you might ask and if you do have anything burning, send it through  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:27):**  the app because it is an interactive session.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:30):**  I want to come back to the point about industry and how we go from having these alternative  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:35):**  farming systems to making them mainstream and having them become an actual industry  
**[0:30:39-0:30:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:39):**  that exists.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:41):**  One barrier you touched on before is scale and then getting to scale.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:44):**  I imagine there's others.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:45):**  So curious to hear how we go from alternative to maybe next year or in a few years at Evoke  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:50):**  we'll be talking about different alternative farming systems because these ones will be  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:54):**  mainstream.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:55):**  Gerard, you want to start?  
**[0:30:57-0:31:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:30:57):**  Well that's a huge challenge.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:00):**  Trying to convince the developed world to consume insects, that's almost impossible  
**[0:31:06-0:31:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:06):**  when you look at it.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:08):**  But sometimes you have luck.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:10):**  You need some luck.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:11):**  And about three years after we started the project, we actually saw the traditional industry,  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:17):**  food industry starting to get into this new arena.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:21):**  And we already can see and we know that companies like PepsiCo already have Doritos with insect  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:27):**  protein and Nestle are working on porridges with insect protein.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:32):**  And the Seattle Mariners serve whole ready to eat grasshoppers at the ballpark and IKEA  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:37):**  announced that they will replace the traditional Swedish meatballs all over the world at the  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:42):**  restaurants from beef to insects.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:46):**  So actually for the startup, this is amazing because this is the greatest challenge and  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:52):**  we have very good friends that really assist us.  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:56):**  Great.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:57):**  James?  
**[0:31:58-0:32:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:31:58):**  Yeah, basically getting from a great idea to a mainstream business is rather difficult  
**[0:32:05-0:32:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:32:05):**  and takes time.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:32:06):**  But I think the simple factor in our industry would be a very financial term and that's  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:32:14):**  just balancing your OpEx and CapEx and then finding a market that's willing to pay for  
**[0:32:19-0:32:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:32:19):**  what you've got.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:32:22):**  So it's one of those things that we've found specifically that to go from just a single  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:32:32):**  farm to having say 30 or 40 farms on the ground, it's really going to be dependent upon not  
**[0:32:38-0:32:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:32:38):**  only the technology changes that happens internally with our systems and it's definitely our system  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:32:45):**  alone has changed drastically since two years ago to now in terms of what we do inside the  
**[0:32:50-0:32:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:32:50):**  farm.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:32:51):**  So that alone has saved us a considerable amount of money and that will obviously continue  
**[0:32:56-0:33:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:32:56):**  and then that will sort of drive our costs down and then allows us to create a more palatable  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:03):**  product price point and market.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:06):**  Emma, do you see the evolution of more cooperatives?  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:11):**  Do you think that more companies will look to set up cooperative structures and around  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:15):**  this kind of data management issue?  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:17):**  Do you think this is a trend that will become more mainstream in New Zealand but also elsewhere?  
**[0:33:22-0:33:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:22):**  That's a tough question.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:23):**  Now, co-ops are under pressure in most places in the world but yeah, it's a tough question.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:28):**  I think that there are a lot of benefits in exploring some of the issues that we're exploring  
**[0:33:36-0:33:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:36):**  now.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:37):**  I think to your previous question around how does some of the alternative become mainstream  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:42):**  and I think data-enabled farming being part of that alternative, I think it really comes  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:46):**  back to your point around the diversity of food systems and it's actually relatively  
**[0:33:51-0:33:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:51):**  recent that we have had less diverse food systems than we've had in the past.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:33:59):**  Farmers will respond to what economically makes sense within the constraints that they're  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:04):**  facing and if we can highlight those constraints and highlight the opportunities, that is the  
**[0:34:11-0:34:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:11):**  pathway to adoption of alternatives or more diverse types of farm systems, in my opinion.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:18):**  Olympia, anything to add?  
**[0:34:21-0:34:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:21):**  We're good?  
**[0:34:22-0:34:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:22):**  Great.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:23):**  So I wanted to turn to the audience and I'm particularly curious for the producers that  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:28):**  raised their hand earlier, kind of how you or if you have any questions or comments on  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:32):**  how you see these alternative models evolving in contrast or in addition to the production  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:38):**  systems that you guys are using and are familiar with.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:42):**  Any questions or comments?  
**[0:34:45-0:34:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:45):**  Everyone's just waiting for lunch?  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:46):**  Happy to sit there.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:48):**  Yeah, come up to the mic please if you don't mind.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:55):**  And if you could just say your name please first.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:34:59):**  Mark Shepherd from AgResearch in New Zealand.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:35:02):**  Got questions for everybody but I'll just take one question.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:35:05):**  That's around data sharing, data ownership, trust, everybody getting value out of it,  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:35:10):**  it's been a theme here already and every meeting you go to, that's a big issue.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:35:14):**  So question for Emma about is the advantage that you've got from your two cooperatives  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:35:19):**  that you already own a lot of data, that you are able to combine with other data sets and  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:35:26):**  extract value from those and share data with other actors in that production chain or are  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:35:31):**  you really just focusing on your own data that you own?  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:35:37):**  So I think what having two big data sets to start with helps out with is that you can  
**[0:35:42-0:35:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:35:42):**  put other data in context and that is important.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:35:45):**  So if you're wanting to understand for example how productive or how profitable somebody  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:35:49):**  is, it's really important to understand how that looks across the entire production base  
**[0:35:54-0:36:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:35:54):**  to say well you might be in the top 20% of the top 20% without that bigger data set,  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:02):**  you actually need the scope.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:04):**  But yeah, the idea is to bring as much data together as we possibly can to kind of start  
**[0:36:08-0:36:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:08):**  to free up the insights.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:10):**  It's not about anyone in particular owning the insights or owning the kind of new ideas,  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:17):**  it's about saying how do we get the data working in a way that people can innovate on it, including  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:23):**  AgriSearch hopefully.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:27):**  Any other questions?  
**[0:36:31-0:36:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:31):**  Bridget Unsworth from New Zealand Venture Investment Fund.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:33):**  Sorry, can you just make sure it's really close to your mouth, it's a bit hard to hear.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:36):**  Bridget Unsworth from New Zealand Venture Investment Fund.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:38):**  I love this concept of endurability as opposed to sustainability and I hadn't kind of thought  
**[0:36:43-0:36:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:43):**  of it like that and I also like the discussion you had around new farming practices need  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:48):**  to sit alongside traditional farming practices.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:52):**  So I guess the question to the entire panel is how do you negotiate the tensions between  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:36:56):**  old farming practices with the new farming practices that you're trying to sort of integrate  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:37:00):**  and how do you integrate to become I guess a cohesive whole in the supply chain or the  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:37:05):**  value chain and the in product that you're offering?  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:37:11):**  So for me it came down to like who the heck we thought we were.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:37:16):**  So I think the challenge is like you go, we're Go Terra, we manage food waste in Maggot Robots,  
**[0:37:23-0:37:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:37:23):**  that's cool but what does that actually mean and what is food waste and so you start to  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:37:30):**  like there's we know we think we know what that is but the more you talk and the more  
**[0:37:34-0:37:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:37:34):**  you speak to people the different things.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:37:36):**  So I could have six pork producers in this room and each of one of them has effluent  
**[0:37:42-0:37:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:37:42):**  as their waste but that effluent will be different because someone's running it off the back  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:37:49):**  of a methane gas capture, someone's hosing down one way, someone likes to settle pot.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:37:54):**  So my job then is to decide am I really a solution or can I only be a solution for one  
**[0:38:02-0:38:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:02):**  human.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:03):**  And our decision was that we were going to be our solution, period.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:08):**  And that meant then that our tech had to be adaptable to the need of our client and it  
**[0:38:14-0:38:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:14):**  also meant that we had to broaden our thoughts outside of just Maggots.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:21):**  So we're like okay now if we're going to manage food waste, maybe it's not just a black soldier  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:26):**  fly anymore because I also want to manage the 10,000 litres of chocolate ice cream that  
**[0:38:31-0:38:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:31):**  Pixie does up in Toowoomba.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:34):**  Black soldier fly won't eat that but a house fly will.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:37):**  So can they live in my tech?  
**[0:38:39-0:38:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:39):**  And so it's like are you delivering a service truly or are you only going to do it in this  
**[0:38:46-0:38:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:46):**  sort of proprietary way?  
**[0:38:48-0:38:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:48):**  I want to do it in an agnostic way.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:51):**  So what have you got?  
**[0:38:52-0:38:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:52):**  Do I have the insects that can manage it?  
**[0:38:54-0:38:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:54):**  Can my tech manage those insects?  
**[0:38:56-0:38:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:56):**  Sweet, we have a deal.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:38:58):**  And that means, not to get too into it, but we also have a dry feed system of that robot  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:05):**  that can handle dried agricultural waste, scrape mark, so that we can raise insects  
**[0:39:10-0:39:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:10):**  for human consumption.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:12):**  And so, but I'm still managing waste, it's just a little bit different.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:16):**  And I think every business is trying to do that in one way or another.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:21):**  But I think when you really can find your way into integration of ecosystems, you have  
**[0:39:26-0:39:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:26):**  to stop thinking more about like, oh well I'm sorry I can only be this and more about  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:33):**  well if we only tweak two things maybe we can still do that.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:36):**  So it's just about that.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:39):**  Any other comments on how to kind of sit and integrate with existing farming systems?  
**[0:39:43-0:39:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:43):**  Yeah, look, I mean, we don't, again, we don't really see ourselves separate from the traditional  
**[0:39:51-0:39:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:51):**  farmers.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:52):**  We see ourselves as part of the industry from a traditional point of view.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:39:59):**  What we're able to do is obviously provide a solution, a bit like we were just saying,  
**[0:40:05-0:40:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:05):**  look at the issues at hand.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:08):**  Can they grow food in Birdsville?  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:12):**  Is that even possible?  
**[0:40:13-0:40:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:13):**  All right, can what we do do that and provide what they need?  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:18):**  And some of the time it may not be that they want food in Birdsville or fresh lettuce or  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:22):**  leafy greens or herbs or they don't want a whole farm that just does one product and  
**[0:40:26-0:40:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:26):**  want a farm that does multiple products.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:29):**  And what does that mean?  
**[0:40:30-0:40:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:30):**  What do we tweak to be able to achieve that?  
**[0:40:32-0:40:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:32):**  So yes, you're constantly trying to integrate with the surrounding industry.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:40):**  And I mean, yeah, by no means do you think that you're going to be the one solution in  
**[0:40:44-0:40:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:44):**  any case.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:46):**  So that's what we've seen with a lot of the research that we've done, especially in far  
**[0:40:51-0:41:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:40:51):**  north Queensland, that our system definitely needs to alter for many different cases.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:01):**  Not greatly, but you definitely need to adjust certain things to be able to achieve what  
**[0:41:05-0:41:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:05):**  the desired result may be.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:08):**  Great.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:09):**  I think we have time for maybe one or two more questions.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:17):**  I'm Harvey Gaynor.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:19):**  James, you mentioned the high energy usage in your farm compared to field production.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:25):**  But I wonder about the energy savings from transport from field to market and transport  
**[0:41:30-0:41:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:30):**  of inputs, that sort of thing.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:33):**  Can you talk to us a bit about what you know about that balance and that comparison?  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:37):**  Because it's something that producers are under more scrutiny for, the whole life cycle  
**[0:41:42-0:41:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:42):**  sort of analysis.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:43):**  And maybe some of the other production systems, what you're seeing with the insects and other  
**[0:41:46-0:41:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:46):**  things as well.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:48):**  I mean, we haven't specifically conducted a huge amount of research in, say, costing  
**[0:41:54-0:42:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:41:54):**  out the energy used on a traditional acre of land to grow iceberg lettuce.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:42:01):**  Our system itself, particularly in any indoor farm, whether it's plenty, aero farms, freight  
**[0:42:09-0:42:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:42:09):**  farms, crop box, all of us, the elephant in the room is that we use a lot of energy.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:42:14):**  Now, that technology in LED has drastically changed from five years ago, 10 years ago,  
**[0:42:20-0:42:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:42:20):**  to today.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:42:21):**  Even our system alone has saved probably in the last six months 40% energy consumption.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:42:28):**  So that's just through the development of technology.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:42:31):**  Now, from a sustainable sort of renewable energy source and developing a true off-grid  
**[0:42:38-0:42:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:42:38):**  solution where we don't need to rely on anything to do with the grid, what we've realized and  
**[0:42:44-0:42:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:42:44):**  what we've researched and done in our own space, our one solution is not going to work.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:42:51):**  So it's going to be a combination of wind, solar, and battery, and even biodigesters  
**[0:42:56-0:43:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:42:56):**  that are turning food waste into power.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:00):**  So those technologies are all great, but they too also have a cost to them.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:05):**  And it depends on your local market.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:07):**  Again, if you're only producing a small quantity, a sort of a micro economy of produce, then  
**[0:43:13-0:43:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:13):**  it may not be worth you spending $80,000 to set up an off-grid system with a payback of,  
**[0:43:21-0:43:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:21):**  say, five or six years.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:23):**  So definitely the economics has to play into it.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:26):**  But yeah, I would love to one day see some real serious research done around the cost  
**[0:43:33-0:43:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:33):**  inputs of, say, diesel on a tractor and implements and the cost of making that implement versus  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:40):**  how that translates into the energy consumption of an indoor farm.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:44):**  Yeah, I just don't have the answer, but I'd love to know if anyone does.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:47):**  Great.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:48):**  So that's all we have time for.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:50):**  I was going to summarize insights and ask a kind of final reflection question, but I  
**[0:43:54-0:43:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:54):**  won't hold you guys up for lunch.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:43:56):**  The one thing I will say that was really a big takeaway for me was this kind of indurability  
**[0:44:00-0:44:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:44:00):**  concept and how these alternative systems need to work in conjunction with and so that  
**[0:44:06-0:44:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:44:06):**  we can have a diverse food system that serves the needs of consumers and investors and farmers.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:44:11):**  So I think it's a really positive message that's probably echoed throughout this conference  
**[0:44:15-0:44:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:44:15):**  yesterday and today.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:44:16):**  So please join me in thanking the panelists.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357326#t=0:44:42):**  Thank you for joining us on another episode of Ag Tech.

**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:00:18):**  the past five years.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:00:20):**  One group that's been helping to drive this is Hands Free Hector, which is now the Hands

**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:00:35):**  At the time, many said it couldn't be done and that robots on farms were still 20 or  
**[0:00:40-0:00:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:00:40):**  even 50 years away.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:00:42):**  Kit Franklin has spearheaded the project, which is a collaboration between Precision  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:00:46):**  Decisions and Harper Adams University, where Kit is also a senior lecturer in agricultural  
**[0:00:51-0:00:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:00:51):**  engineering.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:00:52):**  But it's his work outside the lecture halls that has garnered the most attention.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:00:56):**  And we set a combine driving itself in the middle of a showground combining barley.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:01):**  It's just madness.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:02):**  I don't know why we said yes, we do it.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:04):**  I don't know why.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:05):**  It's just, you know, looking back now, what a crazy thing to do.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:07):**  It'd be crazy enough to run a combine live at a show, let alone one without someone sat  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:11):**  on it, and then include a load of 200 people leaning on a barrier trying to get the best  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:16):**  shot on their camera phone, you know.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:19):**  It's this willingness to do something crazy and show the world while you're doing it that  
**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:23):**  has been the key to the project's success.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:26):**  Sure, now there are many startups and even some big ag machinery companies that are developing  
**[0:01:31-0:01:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:31):**  autonomous vehicles.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:32):**  But for Kit, it was never about bringing a specific product to market.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:36):**  It's been about generating ideas.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:39):**  And there's maybe a lesson in here for all of us about how shifting people's mindsets  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:43):**  can be just as important as developing new technologies.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:47):**  To understand what Kit did and how, we have to go back to the beginning.  
**[0:01:52-0:02:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:01:52):**  So I'm born and brought up on a UK farm, a small farm, essentially arable.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:02:00):**  My father diversified, as it were, and went into construction, essentially farmed on weekends.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:02:05):**  So that's the sort of scale we're talking about.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:02:07):**  It's not a major thing.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:02:09):**  Although my brothers then did go into agriculture in a major way and created a contracting business.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:02:16):**  So my background is both in agricultural contracting and construction contracting.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:02:21):**  So lots of machines, tractors, diggers, dumpers, all of those things were my sort of childhood  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:02:26):**  and hence my interest in engineering, which is what my profession is, obviously.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:02:31):**  Do you find that having a bit of that farming background is helpful in what you're doing  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:02:37):**  now, like just having grown up in it a little bit or grown up around it?  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:02:39):**  Does that have either an influence or kind of help you with credibility and having some  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:02:44):**  of these conversations with the industry?  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:02:46):**  Yeah, it's absolutely essential.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:02:49):**  Now I say that in the sense that I find it essential, but that's not to say that someone  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:02:52):**  who doesn't have that background shouldn't enter this industry.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:02:55):**  I want to see a diverse range of people coming into architect and ag engineering.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:02:59):**  I want new, fresh ideas.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:03:01):**  But yeah, in terms of where I sit, it means that I can communicate with farmers, I can  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:03:06):**  communicate with the customer base essentially a lot better.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:03:09):**  It's that whole thing, it's the world because I've been immersed in it all my life.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:03:13):**  You know all the lingo that you don't even realise isn't normal language and all that  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:03:16):**  sort of stuff.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:03:17):**  Yeah, just having an awareness of the problem.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:03:20):**  So I've said before, if you are coming into ag engineering, ag tech from a non-ag background,  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:03:27):**  I would always encourage people to go and work on a farm.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:03:31):**  Even if it's a day, go and help a farmer out.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:03:33):**  You'll soon learn the difficulties that farming faces and you'll soon find problems that need  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:03:39):**  solving.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:03:40):**  Ag engineers are problem solvers and farms are full of problems.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:03:44):**  Growing up, Kit was more interested in the farm machinery than the actual farming.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:03:48):**  So he went on to study engineering at Harper Adams University.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:03:52):**  Really it was all about big shiny machines and that was what interested me.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:03:55):**  However, Harper Adams is a specialist agricultural rural economy type university.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:04:01):**  And through studying here, I was taught by and also met fellow students who were pure  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:04:06):**  straight agricultural people.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:04:09):**  And through the time of being here and essentially going to the pub and drinking with these people  
**[0:04:13-0:04:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:04:13):**  and chatting away and going to lectures, I actually became more interested in farming.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:04:20):**  So I'd grown up on a farm, but my interest was farm machines.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:04:23):**  It wasn't farming.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:04:24):**  But by the time I graduated, I had sort of developed a love of actually farming itself.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:04:30):**  What came to mind is that I wanted to not just be an engineer in an office drawing things,  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:04:35):**  I wanted to solve farmers problems.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:04:38):**  I can't change farming by developing a new crop because I'm not a biologist, but I can  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:04:44):**  develop farming by changing the machinery or looking at that a bit differently.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:04:49):**  And essentially, I sort of learned to be quite skeptical about the way in which UK farms,  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:04:57):**  Western Europe farms were being farmed.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:04:59):**  I came to believe that we're doing it with, we're using two big machines that are too  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:05:04):**  heavy, aren't very precise.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:05:06):**  And we could be farming with more appropriate machines than we currently are.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:05:10):**  So that was sort of, that was what got my interest in sort of our tech.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:05:15):**  Could we use things other than chemicals to control weeds?  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:05:18):**  That's not to say that I'm completely anti-chemicals, but could we use other tech or a combination  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:05:24):**  of chemical and mechanical technologies?  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:05:27):**  Could we use automation to reduce the scale of our machines?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:05:31):**  All these sorts of ideas were going through my head when I was coming up to graduate,  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:05:35):**  which basically meant I decided I didn't really just want to go and design another big heavy

**[0:05:43-0:05:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:05:43):**  I love it.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:05:44):**  Falling into different careers, that makes sense.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:05:46):**  And then how did the idea for Hands-Free Hector come about?  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:05:48):**  Were you just sitting at the pub where all good agricultural ideas are hatched and thought,  
**[0:05:53-0:05:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:05:53):**  what if we do this crazy project or how did it come to be?  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:05:56):**  I mean, yeah, the story goes, the idea came out of the pub.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:00):**  It wasn't quite like that.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:01):**  I was working, so I was working as a mechanic.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:03):**  Basically I was doing the mechanical bits and I was working with a colleague called  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:06):**  Jonathan Gill, who was doing the electronics control bits.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:11):**  And he's got a background in robotics engineering.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:13):**  And basically we were working under a chap by the name of Professor Simon Blackmore,  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:18):**  who was one of the sort of leading lights in agricultural robotic concepts and ideas  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:23):**  and have been writing about it for 15, 20 years at that time already.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:28):**  So we were surrounded by these ideas of farming with robots and the benefits that that could  
**[0:06:32-0:06:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:32):**  bring.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:34):**  But Jonathan and I were very frustrated that no one seemed to be getting on and doing it.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:38):**  We were doing some quite clever stuff, but most of it was under non-disclosure agreements  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:43):**  and we couldn't talk about it.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:44):**  So I would go to a show, for instance, and I would talk about on a show stand or on a  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:49):**  stage at a show, I would give a talk about the concept of agricultural robotics and the  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:55):**  crowd reaction would be, don't believe it, too far-fetched, where's the proof?  
**[0:06:59-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:06:59):**  I've not seen it.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:00):**  I've not done it.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:01):**  So basically Jonathan and I felt like we could do it.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:03):**  Everyone's saying it can't be done because otherwise it would have been done.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:06):**  And we were saying, well, it can be done, we just haven't done it yet.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:09):**  So basically Jonathan and I decided we were going to, he was developing drones, so flying  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:14):**  machines and his flying machines would come out of the box, they'd fly around the air,  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:19):**  point to point, land back at his feet.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:21):**  So we said, well, could we just take the brain out of John's drones, put it in a tractor,  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:25):**  do farming, show that we could farm with robots, move this story that got very stagnant.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:30):**  There was lots of ideas, but no one really doing it.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:33):**  Yeah, show the world that it was possible, not wrap it up under non-disclosure agreements,  
**[0:07:38-0:07:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:38):**  basically.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:39):**  The phrase hands-free hectare that was, I guess, critical in what gave us the publicity  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:45):**  that we've ended up getting came out of a 15-minute chat after lunch one day.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:49):**  And the story goes, we wrote it on a post-it note and we stuck it on the wall, hands-free  
**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:53):**  hectare.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:54):**  It was quite a big post-it note and we wrote it quite big and it was in our lab and all  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:07:57):**  our superiors came in and out for about six months.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:00):**  No one asked us what the word hands-free hectare meant.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:03):**  And then eventually we managed to sort of put together a funding bid to make it happen  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:07):**  really.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:08):**  The team received funding from Innovate UK, a government innovation agency, and also got  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:13):**  Precision Decisions, a precision ag services company, on board.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:17):**  While the project itself was never about creating a commercial product, it had the potential  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:22):**  to unlock solutions to problems that might eventually be commercialized.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:27):**  Things like freeing up time normally spent on a tractor for other work, reducing soil  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:32):**  compaction with small machines, unlocking precision applications to reduce chemical  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:36):**  inputs and making small farms more profitable by growing more from less or changing the  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:41):**  economics.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:42):**  So it was a feasibility study and really it was about doing exactly what we were setting  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:48):**  out to do, showing if it was possible and if it was possible about sparking another  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:53):**  load of ideas.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:54):**  We always knew we'd create more questions than answers and that's certainly proven to  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:58):**  be the case.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:08:59):**  And I think that's what Innovate quite liked is that ultimately we were going to probably  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:09:04):**  stir up a load of new ideas within the UK.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:09:08):**  And we said we were going to be really public, put it all on social media, invite journalists  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:09:12):**  around, invite camera crews around.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:09:14):**  So again, I think again, they probably liked the fact that we were going to showcase UK  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:09:18):**  and this UK innovation and what small teams on small budgets can achieve if they're focused.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:09:23):**  I mean, that was all the sales pitch was all of those things.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:09:26):**  And then it's gone on to be all of that 10 times what we could have ever imagined.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:09:30):**  So this story has gone, you know, 90 odd countries have published stories on it.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:09:35):**  I've been on most major broadcasters in North America, obviously Europe have played clips  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:09:43):**  of our project.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:09:44):**  It's been absolutely mad.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:09:46):**  And ultimately it was about generating interest in ideas.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:09:50):**  And I think it achieved that.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:09:53):**  It was never at the end of a year, we're going to have a product that's going to make 10  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:09:56):**  million a year turnover or something that was never going to happen.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:09:59):**  It was much more about idea generation.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:02):**  And how about feedback from farmers?  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:04):**  What have you heard and what's the response been from the farming community?  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:08):**  Your action was immensely positive.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:11):**  This whole perception that farmers are backwards, they don't want to know, they don't want to  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:16):**  change, I find mostly completely wrong.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:19):**  It's a very small minority.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:20):**  I do get it.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:21):**  I do get farmers who go, I think you're talking rubbish.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:22):**  It's never going to happen.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:24):**  It's just nice videos.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:26):**  But it's a very small minority.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:27):**  Most think it's really great.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:29):**  And going back to my thing about standing on showstands and giving a speech or whatever,

**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:41):**  Now after hands free, that instantly changed.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:46):**  I'd go show a video, talk about it, and they'd be like, so what do you reckon, the next decade  
**[0:10:51-0:10:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:51):**  or so?  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:52):**  It really changed that perception.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:53):**  It did exactly what I hoped it would do.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:10:56):**  By showing we could do it, it changed the mindset of all those people who've seen it.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:11:01):**  And then in the bigger context, it's very easy to try and take all the credit for everything  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:11:07):**  that's happened in automation in the last 5 years, but I won't try and do that.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:11:11):**  But genuinely, in 2016, I could not point to an agricultural robot or an agricultural  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:11:19):**  robotics project that got beyond a car park.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:11:22):**  That was our pitch.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:11:24):**  We are going to go beyond a car park, we're going to grow crops.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:11:28):**  We were the first to do it in terms of getting all the way through that growth cycle.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:11:33):**  And then since then, I can now point to 10s of examples of companies and projects where  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:11:39):**  they are growing crops with robots and where robots are on sale and whatever.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:11:44):**  So I'm not saying I caused all that.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:11:46):**  But we were the perfect time.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:11:48):**  We generated this huge amount of interest.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:11:50):**  And since then, there's been a big follow up from the commercial world, from universities  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:11:54):**  around the world as well, who've followed in that wake of publicity and appetite, I  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:00):**  think, from farmers.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:01):**  Because the appetite suddenly came that, when can I buy this?  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:05):**  When can I buy this?  
**[0:12:06-0:12:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:06):**  Well, again, 2017, I was still going, oh, well, not yet.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:09):**  Now when someone says, when can I buy it?  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:11):**  I say, well, go and talk to one of these companies because I think they might be able to help  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:14):**  you.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:15):**  Yeah, right.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:16):**  So do you, obviously one of the pushbacks there is, well, you guys did it, but it was  
**[0:12:19-0:12:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:19):**  at a pretty small scale.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:20):**  And obviously there's lots of kind of asterisks and caveats and that kind of thing.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:24):**  How do you, what happened next?  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:27):**  Because obviously that was the next step in expanding it.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:29):**  But also how do you respond to that question around like, well, proving it's possible in  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:34):**  a controlled environment with a university setting and a couple hundred K, that's pretty  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:37):**  different than revolutionizing farming in commercial practice.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:41):**  Yeah, no, that's a good point.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:43):**  And in fact, I just didn't touch on that.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:44):**  But yeah, so I get, this is brilliant, but then I'd also get, it is a square flat field.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:49):**  My fields aren't square and flat, and they're certainly bigger than one hectare.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:52):**  So we do get that, but I still, even the people who are saying that are mostly being positive.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:12:57):**  They're not, they're just going, how do I see it in my farm sort of thing.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:01):**  So yeah, it made us want to do it better.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:04):**  But if you look back to our very first videos, our first field of crop looked pretty rubbish.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:09):**  No one would be proud of it.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:10):**  The only people that were proud of it were the people who just made a robot do it.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:12):**  We were very proud of it.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:13):**  It was all full of misses.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:15):**  The tractor drove like a snake up the field.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:18):**  The combine was pretty good actually, by the time we got to harvest, but it wasn't great.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:22):**  So we instantly rolled it over again, and we got another sort of smaller dose of funding  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:28):**  to eventually do it again and make it better.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:30):**  And in the second year we had far better coverage and the tractor drove far better and etc.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:35):**  So that was one thing we could do to instantly go, look, yeah, we had a single year and a  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:39):**  single little bit of money and a pretty small team.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:42):**  There's only really 3 of us working on it.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:44):**  And that's what we achieved.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:45):**  But look, after another year, we've already made it this much better.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:48):**  And now since then, we've gone on to now have what we call the Hands-Free Farm, which is  
**[0:13:54-0:13:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:54):**  now 35 hectares.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:55):**  It's 5 fields.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:56):**  They're sort of average UK field sizes.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:13:59):**  So we've got one that's 2 hectares, pretty small.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:02):**  We've got one that's sort of 15 hectares, which is reasonable for the UK.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:06):**  They're not the biggest fields you'll find here, but they're fairly representative of  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:11):**  UK fields.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:12):**  And they're not square, they're not completely flat, they're not the most banked, but there  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:16):**  is topography in them.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:18):**  They're certainly not square in shape though.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:20):**  They've got wonky headlands, we've got trees and telegraph poles, power lines, we've got  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:25):**  footpaths.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:26):**  So a big issue in the UK ag, or a big issue for the UK autonomous ag is we have footpaths  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:33):**  everywhere.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:34):**  So people can take their dog for a walk through the middle of our fields or around the edges  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:38):**  of our fields.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:39):**  And how do we deal with that?  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:40):**  I know that Australia, they've just released the code of practice for Australian autonomous  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:45):**  farm vehicles, which we've had really good contact, pretty positive contact with those  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:49):**  guys.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:50):**  But there's very little in that document that is about the public because farm setting in  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:56):**  Australia, not much public.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:14:58):**  For us, that's our biggest concern.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:15:01):**  I think there's a massive section on wildfires.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:15:03):**  Well, that's less of a concern for the UK where it rains all the time.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:15:07):**  But the point is, we've now scaled it up, we've got real fields that are real weird  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:15:10):**  shapes and sizes.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:15:12):**  And now we're continuing to show this.

**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:15:20):**  just because the research has got so much more tricky, it's been harder to keep the

**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:15:25):**  When we had one hectare, the jobs took a couple of hours and then you were done.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:15:29):**  So you could do lots of YouTube and tweets to tell the world now we've got 35 hectares  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:15:34):**  that will take so much more time, where it's harder to keep on top of making sure we've  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:15:39):**  got a YouTube video up and making sure we've got a tweet out and whatever.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:15:42):**  But we do try our best to keep people in the loop, show people the bad as well as the good.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:15:47):**  I mean, I did a Facebook live video once, I was watching the sprayer go across the field,  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:15:51):**  it just completely went off at an angle.

**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:15:54):**  I was like, well, the whole point is we're showing that this isn't easy, that we're having  
**[0:15:58-0:15:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:15:58):**  problems.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:15:59):**  So yeah, I mean, it's getting to the point now that a UK farmer can come and see our  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:16:06):**  fields and go, yeah, this is representative of what I work with on a daily basis.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:16:11):**  So yes, I mean, just a funny story.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:16:14):**  We demonstrated a robotic combine at Cereals, which is one of the UK's biggest agricultural

**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:16:24):**  So we had a sort of 20 metre by 20 metre plot of barley in the middle of show with a fence  
**[0:16:28-0:16:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:16:28):**  around it.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:16:29):**  And we set a combine driving itself in the middle of a show ground combining barley.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:16:34):**  I mean, it's just madness.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:16:36):**  I don't know why we said yes, we do it.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:16:37):**  I don't know why.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:16:38):**  It's just, you know, looking back now, what a crazy thing to do.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:16:40):**  It'd be crazy enough to run a combine live at a show, let alone one without someone sat  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:16:45):**  on it, and then include a load of, you know, 200 people leaning on a barrier trying to  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:16:49):**  get the best shot on their camera phone, you know.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:16:52):**  So we've done some pretty crazy stuff to try and communicate what we do and try and build  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:16:58):**  that appetite for what we do.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:00):**  It's really interesting, the balance there, like it really resonates with what you're  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:03):**  saying about doing the work versus showing it off and starting those conversations.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:07):**  But you really have to do both because there's, especially in Ag, right, there's so many people  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:10):**  that just get on with doing the work, and then no one hears about it.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:13):**  And then there's sort of this frustration when it's like, oh, but we're already doing  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:16):**  that.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:17):**  We're way ahead.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:18):**  But we're not talking about it.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:19):**  And yet it is really hard to balance and find the time to have those conversations and make  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:21):**  it accessible and edit the video and have the tweet.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:24):**  Like it's not easy.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:27):**  It's like, you know, I've been saying every day that someone's going to come out and go,  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:29):**  oh, you know, you've been spending the last five years claiming you're the world's first  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:32):**  people to grow an entire cropping cycle autonomously.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:34):**  Well, actually, we did it before.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:36):**  We just never told anyone.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:37):**  As yet, no one's come out and said it.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:40):**  It's that fact that I know for certain, there are certain people who are a long way ahead  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:43):**  of us at certain points of what we do, but maybe aren't telling the world.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:48):**  For whatever reason, a lot of the bigger companies, it's not currently right for them to commercially  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:56):**  advertise what they're doing, you know, ultimately.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:17:58):**  Whereas if you're the smaller startup or you're the disruptor, it makes a lot of sense to  
**[0:18:04-0:18:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:18:04):**  be making a lot of noise.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:18:06):**  I want to come back to that point actually around the big guys, but tell me about the  
**[0:18:10-0:18:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:18:10):**  tech stack.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:18:11):**  Like what have you guys had to build versus buy?  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:18:14):**  Essentially with the original system, we based that around open source drone technology,  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:18:19):**  the stuff that was making multi-rotors fly.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:18:21):**  So we took the control board, which has got various GPS chip IMUs, et cetera, essentially  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:18:28):**  a mobile, essentially the guts of a smartphone running open source software, mission planner,  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:18:35):**  if anyone wants to have a go, Pixhawk controllers.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:18:37):**  If again, if you want to have a go, if you can still get them, they might not even exist  
**[0:18:40-0:18:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:18:40):**  anymore.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:18:41):**  I don't know.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:18:42):**  So we basically took that off the shelf stuff that anybody could buy for a couple of hundred  
**[0:18:45-0:18:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:18:45):**  quid, and then we integrated that through motor controllers, et cetera, into a hydrostatic  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:18:55):**  tractor of around 40 horsepower, an Izeki tractor.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:18:58):**  The tractor was all mechanical, so there's no fly by wire on it.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:02):**  So it's like literally a foot pedal to make it go forwards and backwards.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:06):**  So we put a linear actuator on that foot pedal and pushed and pulled the foot pedal.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:11):**  We had a motor on the steering column to turn the steering column.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:15):**  So it was all quite, I guess, sort of rudimentary.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:17):**  And that was all part of it as well.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:19):**  It doesn't have to be complicated, because again, that's a massive barrier that people  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:23):**  use to automation is they go, oh, but it needs to be so complicated.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:26):**  We need SLAM and we need radars and we need this.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:28):**  No, you don't.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:30):**  If you're Elon Musk and Tesla, yeah, you might need all that stuff and you've got loads of  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:35):**  money.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:36):**  But actually most of the time you don't need that stuff.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:38):**  Most of the time there are simple solutions to these things.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:40):**  So we did it pretty simply.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:43):**  This is all GPS based, absolutely critical.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:46):**  It's got RTK GPS.

**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:53):**  Again, just to show that we could do it without spending it because everyone goes, oh, RTK  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:57):**  system, five, six thousand pounds.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:19:58):**  Well, no, we did it with a fifteen hundred pound RTK system, actually.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:02):**  It doesn't have to be loads of money.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:04):**  So that was what original hands-free was plus some safety on top.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:07):**  So we had laser scanner on the front and we had safety stop buttons.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:10):**  Now, since then, we've now teamed up with a further company.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:13):**  So we still work with Precision Decisions, who are now owned by a bigger company called  
**[0:20:17-0:20:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:17):**  Map of Ag, who some of your listeners may have heard of.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:19):**  They're a New Zealand based company.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:21):**  But now we also work with a company called FarmScanAg.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:24):**  Now FarmScanAg have Australian origins and they have been making control systems for  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:30):**  sprayers and seeders and GPS systems for years.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:34):**  And they are working with us to develop a more sort of proprietary retrofit autonomous  
**[0:20:39-0:20:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:39):**  system.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:40):**  So it's kind of the same thing.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:41):**  We call it the beam now.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:42):**  So rather than a PixHawk controller, we now have a thing we call the beam, which is a  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:46):**  metal box full of wizardry.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:48):**  And that goes on the top of the cab.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:50):**  And then we take the signals from that.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:52):**  And as Harper Adams, we integrate that with the tractor.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:55):**  Now we have now three different tractors, three different levels of complexity.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:20:59):**  We still have our first one, which is all mechanical levers and links, but we also have  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:03):**  two others that have more electronics on them.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:06):**  So CAN systems.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:08):**  So we're taking those signals and now we just send a CAN signal to the transmission to go  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:12):**  faster, slower.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:14):**  We now send an electronic signal to a hydraulic block to turn the wheels left or right.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:19):**  So it's all kind of progressed a little bit.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:22):**  And the aim is now in terms of, again, you asked earlier what are the commercial outcomes?  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:26):**  Well, Hansfree was all about ideas.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:29):**  Hansfree Hector was all about ideas.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:30):**  Hansfree Farm is now about getting towards commercialisation.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:33):**  So that product, FarmScan here in the UK are developing what they hope will be a retrofit  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:39):**  product that you can go and buy from them to fit on your tractor.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:43):**  That's the aim.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:44):**  But again, still all GPS based.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:46):**  We've limited sort of safety from lasers, radars, that sort of stuff.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:50):**  And when you did Hansfree Hector, you were saying you were kind of looking out at the  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:53):**  world and feeling like you guys were really ahead of where things were in beyond the concept  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:21:59):**  videos and the parking lot demos.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:22:01):**  When you look out now and you see all those companies out there and probably some of the  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:22:05):**  R&D labs of the big guys, do you still feel like what you're doing is cutting edge or  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:22:10):**  is it answering more academic questions or more raising awareness again?  
**[0:22:14-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:22:14):**  How do you kind of see the landscape?  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:22:16):**  I don't know.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:22:17):**  It's quite easy to sometimes see still a promo video come out from one of the new startups  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:22:23):**  that shows a really flash dashboard software package that they instantly create a route  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:22:29):**  map around the field.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:22:30):**  And you go, oh God, we're still behind that.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:22:32):**  Ours is still taking us an hour to create a route map.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:22:36):**  And then you go, but remember, it's still a marketing video.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:22:39):**  So I think we're probably there or thereabouts with most people around the world and what  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:22:43):**  they're doing.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:22:44):**  But we are different in the sense that our partners are trying to do commercial things.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:22:52):**  So PD is part of MapVag are trying to do the dashboarding, the sort of remote monitoring,  
**[0:22:58-0:23:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:22:58):**  generating route plans, that stuff.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:23:00):**  You've got FarmScan trying to make a really robust on tractor system and trying to build  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:23:06):**  relationships with other companies to do the safety side of that onboard system.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:23:11):**  And obviously you're still trying to do this outreach, again, still trying to show the  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:23:14):**  world what we're doing.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:23:16):**  And we try and actively build up all the other people.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:23:19):**  If you look at me on Twitter, I spend my life retweeting all these other companies that  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:23:23):**  are doing cool stuff because I've been talking about it for years.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:23:26):**  And those people who did say I was talking rubbish, it's nice now that I can go, no,  
**[0:23:30-0:23:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:23:30):**  here's another one to look at.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:23:32):**  So what has Kit learned about the future of autonomous farming?  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:23:35):**  Will companies be more successful in focusing on retrofit solutions or will it be companies  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:23:41):**  building new autonomous machinery that succeed?  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:23:44):**  And will this be done by startups or the big machinery companies?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:23:48):**  So for me, we made sure our farm looked like a farm because of our trying to tell a story  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:23:56):**  thing.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:23:57):**  I didn't want a machine that didn't look like a tractor doing farming because I wanted it  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:24:01):**  to be relatable and digestible to farmers.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:24:05):**  I didn't want it to look like a spaceship had landed in our field to do some farming.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:24:09):**  Now there are people making spaceships to go farming who are believers that it's going  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:24:15):**  to be some sort of revolution and the tractors will all be burned and their spaceships will  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:24:20):**  take over.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:24:21):**  I normally call them Hoovers, actually.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:24:22):**  I normally say they look like Hoovers, vacuum cleaners.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:24:25):**  I personally think it will be a sort of evolution rather than a revolution.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:24:28):**  And that's the reason that I think that the stuff we're doing with retrofit has its place.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:24:33):**  So I've got a tractor, I still quite like the idea of being able to drive it myself  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:24:39):**  between places, maybe doing just a quick job.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:24:44):**  But actually, if I'm going to stick it in a field to drive up and down in straight lines  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:24:47):**  for 10 hours to turn a field brown, I quite like the idea of it driving itself with a  
**[0:24:52-0:24:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:24:52):**  retrofit system on it.

**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:24:56):**  questioning, well, actually, I don't even want to do the small jobs either.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:24:59):**  Maybe I do want a thing that's purely a robot.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:01):**  So I think there's a place for retrofit.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:04):**  The same as auto steer.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:07):**  At first, auto steer was a retrofit market.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:11):**  Now the retrofit market's completely died because it comes out of factory standard.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:16):**  And I just see the same as that happening for us is that at first it will be retrofit  
**[0:25:20-0:25:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:20):**  and individual and weird and novel.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:23):**  And then as time goes on, it will mature into a situation where you buy dedicated autonomous  
**[0:25:28-0:25:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:28):**  machines and those machines may look like vacuum cleaners or whatever, spaceships or  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:34):**  whatever, you know.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:35):**  But I wanted our tractors to look like tractors.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:38):**  Yeah, fair enough.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:39):**  I like the vacuum cleaner example.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:41):**  We've definitely seen a few of those.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:43):**  Do you see the, there's sort of two, I guess, other dimensions here.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:48):**  One is robots that do specific tasks.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:50):**  So I'm building a spraying robot, I'm building a spreading robot or whatever it might be  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:55):**  versus the more kind of utility platform approach.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:25:59):**  What's your view on how the world will evolve there?  
**[0:26:01-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:01):**  Yeah, so you just used the word utility platform.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:04):**  What you're saying there is the word tractor, aren't you?  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:06):**  Because what a tractor is, is it's a moving thing that powers and pulls other things and  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:12):**  they are interchangeable.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:13):**  And the amount of times, yeah, I read people going, oh, no, this is a brand new robotic  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:17):**  system that's got adaptable and integratable with different parts.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:21):**  Okay, so it's a tractor then, isn't it?  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:23):**  What you've developed there is a tractor.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:24):**  It doesn't look like a tractor, but you've developed a new type of tractor, haven't you?  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:29):**  So again, this is where I come from an ag background.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:32):**  I've driven, I find a lot of these startups and I get quite cynical about some of the  
**[0:26:36-0:26:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:36):**  wording.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:37):**  It's like another one that gets me, this is just because I'm on a rant now.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:39):**  Another one that gets me is farming as a service.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:42):**  So always reading about farming as a service.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:45):**  Now, yeah, great in Silicon Valley, something as a service is a sexy term.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:50):**  So using as a service gets you investment in Silicon Valley, but I'm a farmer.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:26:55):**  So farming as a service is called in the UK, is called contracting, is existed for the  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:00):**  last hundred years.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:03):**  My grandfather used to have a threshing box and used to go around all the farms in our  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:06):**  area threshing everyone's grain in 1930.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:10):**  Farming as a service is called contracting and it's existed forever.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:13):**  So stop trying to tell me that you're reinventing a wheel you're not reinventing.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:17):**  And the same is said for the, so back to your actual question.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:22):**  Yes, there will be robots that will be developed to do niche weird things.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:26):**  This is a purely weeding robot.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:28):**  There will also be robots that can have different implements to do different jobs, but I would  
**[0:27:32-0:27:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:32):**  call that a tractor.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:34):**  I think that's true.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:35):**  I mean, we just wrote an article called how Silicon Valley killed ag tech.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:38):**  So I can join you on this rant as I sit here in Silicon Valley recording this podcast,  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:41):**  but it is this interesting influence, like confluence of these two worlds.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:44):**  And to your point in the beginning, these new perspectives that are coming in, maybe  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:47):**  you have worked at Tesla or maybe you have worked, like we absolutely need those perspectives,  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:51):**  but they need to be grounded in how farming actually works.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:54):**  Yes.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:55):**  If you say, I'm going to come and contract for you with a robot, he'll go, okay, I'm  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:27:59):**  interested.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:00):**  You know, because instantly you're talking the right language.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:02):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:03):**  What have you learned, Kit, about how the, so we've talked a little bit about how equipment  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:07):**  will change or not change in some cases.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:10):**  How about how the whole kind of system needs to change?  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:12):**  You know, there's a bunch of angles there, kind of new jobs and education, nonchemical  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:17):**  approaches, given what robots can do, sort of standards and robot interactions with humans,  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:21):**  insurance, like what's most exciting to you about how the whole system starts to change  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:26):**  when we have autonomy?  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:28):**  I think one big aim for me being an educator, as it were, is there's a big, there's a big  
**[0:28:33-0:28:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:33):**  game that people stop seeing agriculture as backwards and something that only, to be really  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:41):**  blunt, only idiots would do farming.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:42):**  If you're not very clever, go and do some farming, you know, which is still the attitude  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:47):**  when I was at school here in the UK, it was definitely the, you know, I had friends who  
**[0:28:50-0:28:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:50):**  just wanted to be farmers.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:52):**  And that was like, wow, you are pretty stupid.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:54):**  So carry on sort of thing.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:28:55):**  Or, you know, so what I want to see is we get away from that because now actually to  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:29:00):**  be a farmer is to, well, and those again, those who farm know this all along, being  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:29:04):**  a farmer is being a businessman, it's being a vet, it's being a this, being a that, you  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:29:08):**  know, it's a million things, being an engineer, it's being a mechanic.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:29:11):**  But again, what we'll make, again, what I think will make the wider world realise is  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:29:15):**  go look, no, farming is being a robotics engineer.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:29:18):**  No, let's be even more blunt.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:29:21):**  People who I currently lecture as undergrad students came to Harper Adams because they  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:29:25):**  saw my project and thought it was interesting.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:29:28):**  So people who wouldn't have come into my industry are sat in my lectures now because of my project.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:29:34):**  So that encapsulates what I'm trying to achieve here in terms of getting those new fresh brains  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:29:38):**  into this world.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:29:40):**  And I say every fresh idea is good, but make sure it's rooted in Ag.

**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:29:46):**  Rooted in Ag.

**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:29:52):**  You probably get asked to and like, given the timing of when you started this project  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:29:56):**  and the questions or concerns from some groups around labour in agriculture and the role  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:30:02):**  of autonomy, taking jobs, taking over, given where you sit in the UK, thinking about Brexit,  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:30:06):**  you know, did that at all play into the kind of media and conversations that you've been  
**[0:30:10-0:30:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:30:10):**  having around this project?  
**[0:30:12-0:30:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:30:12):**  Yeah, so my statement is that the work we're doing, which is very much arable agriculture,  
**[0:30:18-0:30:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:30:18):**  cereal, crop production, etc, is we lost our labour 30, 40, 50 years ago.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:30:25):**  I have a graph that I open up conferences with that shows the labour force on UK farms  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:30:31):**  against the growth of population in the UK.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:30:33):**  And basically, 100 years ago, 5% of the UK population worked on farms, now 1% does.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:30:40):**  So I'm not trying to cope with a lack of labour in the future.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:30:43):**  I'm trying to cope with a lack of labour now.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:30:46):**  And if I can take someone out of a track to see, driving in straight lines, you know,

**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:31:10):**  is all about.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:31:11):**  It's about better utilising the people we have, much less than it is about getting rid  
**[0:31:16-0:31:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:31:16):**  of those people.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:31:17):**  That is not a factor I'm playing into.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:31:19):**  Now, here in the UK, you mentioned Brexit, we do have an issue in the horticulture, fresh  
**[0:31:24-0:31:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:31:24):**  fruit, fresh food produce sector, because we have a lack of people coming into the country  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:31:30):**  now to pick fruit, vegetables, whatever.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:31:34):**  So there is plenty of projects, plenty of research going on around can we robotically  
**[0:31:39-0:31:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:31:39):**  pick strawberries, I mean, you've probably spoke to people doing this sort of thing.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:31:42):**  And that is about plugging a labour gap.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:31:45):**  But that isn't my project.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:31:46):**  And that's not what I'm trying to do.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:31:48):**  Just to go into that, what I find interesting again, here's my two pence on another thing,  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:31:53):**  is that people in the world of agriculture robotics seem to try and want to solve the,  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:31:59):**  I hate the word, but I can't ever think of anything better, the sort of sexy problems.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:32:04):**  So I want to pick strawberries, because that will be really jazzy.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:32:07):**  I'll make a really good funding, begging bowl video, if I can pick strawberries.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:32:13):**  Actually, do you know what, if you go on a fruit farm, 40% of the people are picking  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:32:18):**  fruit, then there's 20% that are doing logistics, moving fruit up and down polytunnels.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:32:23):**  And then there's 40% who are grading them in a shed somewhere.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:32:26):**  Well, do you know which are the easy bits to automate?  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:32:29):**  Grading is really easy to automate, moving stuff up and down polytunnels is easy to automate.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:32:33):**  Has anyone automated it yet?  
**[0:32:35-0:32:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:32:35):**  Not really, not widely.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:32:37):**  Stop trying to pick strawberries, do the stuff that's easy first, you know, it drives me  
**[0:32:41-0:32:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:32:41):**  mad.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:32:42):**  But the amount of funding that's been thrown at picking a strawberry when actually just  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:32:46):**  sorting out the logistics would be a much quicker labor saving, if that's truly what  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:32:51):**  you're trying to do.

**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:32:57):**  resource we have in a better way.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:00):**  Full stop.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:01):**  Love it.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:02):**  And I guess, last question, along the lines of some of the other changes, you mentioned  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:06):**  code of practice, kind of standards, insurance, what are you seeing change there?  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:10):**  What have you guys learned about how, again, that kind of broader system needs to evolve?  
**[0:33:14-0:33:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:14):**  Yeah, at the moment, there is no system.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:16):**  So we operate under autonomous trialing code of practice here in the UK.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:22):**  There is no legislative legal framework in which to operate an autonomous tractor machine  
**[0:33:27-0:33:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:27):**  in a field.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:29):**  So we are trying to develop that.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:31):**  That's probably the biggest, most important piece of work I am doing, really, at the moment  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:35):**  is we are working with the British Standards Institute to develop a UK code of practice  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:40):**  for autonomous vehicle operations, very similar to the Australian one, but specific for our  
**[0:33:45-0:33:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:45):**  marketplace.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:46):**  And obviously, that has buy in from multiple manufacturers, farming groups, we have people  
**[0:33:53-0:33:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:53):**  like walking groups here in the UK, what do they want to see from an autonomous system  
**[0:33:56-0:33:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:56):**  to make them feel safe?  
**[0:33:58-0:34:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:33:58):**  So they're around the table, you know, we've got the health and safety exec, we've got,  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:34:02):**  you know, so we've got a lot of people around the table discussing how do we use these machines  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:34:07):**  in a way that is both profitable and safe, because we're very, very clear, if you look  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:34:12):**  at our economics that we've done, if you require permanent onsite supervision, it kills the  
**[0:34:17-0:34:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:34:17):**  economics.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:34:18):**  The whole point is it's getting the person out of the field and back in the office or  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:34:21):**  in another field with a spade or whatever, as I said earlier, and if you, our economic  
**[0:34:26-0:34:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:34:26):**  models are based around 10% human interaction, they don't actually change much if you put  
**[0:34:31-0:34:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:34:31):**  it up to 20% human interaction at the moment.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:34:33):**  So our models suggest we can cut the cost of wheat production by around 30 pounds per  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:34:38):**  tonne in the UK, which is basically a profit margin or not, essentially.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:34:42):**  So it's really, really good to see.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:34:43):**  It makes smaller farms profitable, which is interesting from a UK landscape point of view,  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:34:49):**  we've got a lot of farms that have had to amalgamate or, you know, one person rents  
**[0:34:53-0:34:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:34:53):**  out the other and then goes and gets a job or whatever.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:34:55):**  So our system can make 100 hectare farm profitable in the UK from our modelling.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:01):**  At the moment, you need to be 500 hectares to be profitable growing wheat.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:05):**  So that's a big change for our countryside, but it can only happen if we get a good framework  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:10):**  in which to operate.

**[0:35:13-0:35:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:13):**  And all of that is only possible because I'm now, for want of a better word, vaguely famous.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:19):**  So when we speak to the insurance companies, they will talk to me because they go, oh,  
**[0:35:24-0:35:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:24):**  my gosh, that's that chap who knows about robots.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:26):**  And we've seen him on telly and he's been in the magazines a few times.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:28):**  So they pick up the phone.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:30):**  You know, if we hadn't done hands free, I wouldn't be able to be pushing those agendas.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:35):**  So those hands free has enabled me to push those agendas on the behalf of the whole industry,  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:40):**  I like to think.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:41):**  That's probably a question you get asked all the time.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:44):**  I know it's when I get asked, like, there's all these startup companies building the vacuum  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:48):**  cleaners and spaceships and new digital three point linkage equivalents, etc.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:53):**  Why won't the big guys just do it?  
**[0:35:54-0:35:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:54):**  Do you get asked that and how do you answer it?  
**[0:35:57-0:35:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:57):**  Because it's massively disruptive to their marketplace.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:35:59):**  So the market has been, buy a tractor, buy a new tractor, it's bigger and shinier than  
**[0:36:05-0:36:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:05):**  the one you had before.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:07):**  That is how big companies have sold stuff.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:10):**  And I very bluntly say that to them when I speak to them.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:12):**  You know, that is the market.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:13):**  If it's newer, shinier, got a bit more chrome, got a bit more horsepower, it will sell.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:18):**  What my world is suggesting is that no, maybe it doesn't need to always be bigger.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:23):**  Maybe it needs to be more precise, smaller and more niche, more capable, not just bigger.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:28):**  And that is massively disruptive.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:31):**  And yeah, so why would you want to do it?  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:34):**  In a sense, if you're making lots of money doing what you're doing, why would you want  
**[0:36:37-0:36:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:37):**  to do it?  
**[0:36:38-0:36:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:38):**  And all of those big companies could have done it 10, 12 years ago.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:43):**  They made a decision not to, is the way I like to look.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:46):**  When they made tractors steer themselves, they could have very easily gone, right, let's  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:51):**  make them autonomous in the next 5, 10 years, let's do it.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:54):**  But they all made the decision not to because they didn't need to essentially.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:36:58):**  Now, though, with all the startups, with people like me being a thorn in the side, you start  
**[0:37:05-0:37:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:37:05):**  to see it coming out.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:37:06):**  So John Deere, denial knowledge of or denial appetite for autonomous farming forever until  
**[0:37:14-0:37:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:37:14):**  Agrotechnica 2019, they have half a showstand dedicated to agricultural robots out of nowhere.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:37:20):**  You know, John Deere, not interested in agricultural robots.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:37:22):**  Oh, wait, today we are.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:37:24):**  You know, why was that?  
**[0:37:25-0:37:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:37:25):**  Now again, that's one of the things that I like to take a little bit of credit for because  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:37:28):**  it was people like myself and my team and others like us who basically pushed them into  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:37:32):**  a corner where they couldn't not do it anymore.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:37:36):**  They had to go, oh, we're doing it too.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:37:38):**  You know, so yeah, why the big guys aren't doing it right now is pretty much because  
**[0:37:43-0:37:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:37:43):**  of it's very disruptive.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:37:46):**  But Kit doesn't see the future of farming as a job that can be performed entirely from  
**[0:37:50-0:37:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:37:50):**  inside an office, which for the farmers listening is probably a relief.  
**[0:37:56-0:37:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:37:56):**  We obviously went under branding of hands free.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:37:58):**  And so the hands free hectare, just to put a finer point, we never went in that field.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:01):**  We did all the agronomy remotely.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:03):**  We had a fence around the field, only the machines.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:05):**  We basically drove the machines through the fence, got off the machine, walked out the  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:09):**  field, off it went.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:10):**  The drones did the sampling, everything.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:11):**  We never did went in the field.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:13):**  We never took a sample.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:15):**  Everything was done remotely.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:16):**  And then obviously the question was, so is that what you see the future of farming be?  
**[0:38:20-0:38:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:20):**  And I always have to go, no, we're just trying to prove a point that it can be done.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:23):**  I think that kind of goes to show that if we can make the job more diverse, more whatever,  
**[0:38:29-0:38:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:29):**  then that's kind of a good thing.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:30):**  And of course, these machines aren't going to work 100% of the time.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:32):**  You still need that 10, 20% interaction where you're going to be setting them up, servicing  
**[0:38:37-0:38:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:37):**  them, whatever.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:38):**  It's a new set of skills.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/7/27/is-the-future-of-farming-hands-free#t=0:38:41):**  I want people to be out there touching things, you know, touching, smelling, digging.

### Agtech - So What?  (2018-12-04)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly changing  the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting started.  But there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between Ag and  
**[0:00:35-0:00:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:00:35):**  AgTech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring you the  story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where Ag and Tech  meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. So Chris, welcome to the show. Thanks so much  
**[0:00:59-0:01:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:00:59):**  for joining us today. My pleasure. Thanks for having me.  Anytime. So you are an organic mushroom farmer and you are the only organic mushroom farmer  that I know. And I know very little about mushroom farming, let alone organic mushroom  
**[0:01:14-0:01:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:01:14):**  farming. So I wanted to start with your story, how you got into doing this, because my understanding  is that you don't come from a history of organic mushroom farmers. So what was the decision  like to get into this space and to pick organic mushrooms of all things?  
**[0:01:34-0:01:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:01:34):**  I was in my late teens, early 20s. I had a pretty keen interest in technology and FinTech  and finance and stuff on the internet. And I was learning a lot about how we allocate  resources and how we finance stuff and how we capitalise projects as a culture and a  
**[0:01:59-0:02:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:01:59):**  society. And I wasn't too impressed with how that system was working. And at the same time,  I was developing an interest in soil and dirt and fungi. There was one particular afternoon  where I was playing around on the USDA's website and they've got a whole bunch of raw data  
**[0:02:19-0:02:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:02:19):**  from like 1952 or something all the way through the current day, which shows nutrient density  in a whole range of different vegetables. And it's all raw data, so it's all kind of,  you've got to download it and you see big spreadsheets and stuff. It's not really readily  
**[0:02:36-0:02:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:02:36):**  compiled anywhere. But I kind of was curious about that. So I did that. I downloaded a  whole bunch of it. I compiled it and it was pretty obvious that there was a massive drop  off in nutrient density in a whole bunch of foods. And so I kind of had it. And then as  
**[0:02:54-0:03:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:02:54):**  I said, at the same time, I was spending a bit of time wandering through the bush and  learning about fungi and soil and dirt. And so I came to the view that the dirt and soil  problem was a significant one because our nutrient density in the food was dropping  
**[0:03:09-0:03:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:03:09):**  significantly. I assumed that would be highly related to a whole bunch of the health issues  in our society. And I also became a little bit concerned that we were going to run out  of topsoil, which is where all those nutrients come from. And so the farming methodologies  
**[0:03:27-0:03:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:03:27):**  we were using and production methodologies, I assumed had to have something to do with  that. I got interested in, that's when I took more of a notice and interest in organic food  or kind of regenerative type farming systems, a bit of curiosity around biodynamics and  
**[0:03:45-0:04:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:03:45):**  permaculture and stuff. And so I did a permaculture course, I did a biodynamic course, I did a  lot of self-taught online agricultural stuff. Went around to farmers markets, started talking  around to rattling the cages of small scale kind of market gardeners and wherever they  
**[0:04:06-0:04:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:04:06):**  would let me go to visit their farms and kind of learning about what they were doing. But  I also had some really good friends that had done some of those courses and had gone and  got market garden and they were struggling, I guess. So it's hard enough to learn how  
**[0:04:24-0:04:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:04:24):**  to grow food, complex processes, but they were really struggling with the business side  of it and not understanding their markets and their supply chains. If they grew stuff,  where would they sell it and how and take it to market and all the rest of it. So I  
**[0:04:40-0:04:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:04:40):**  was a little bit hesitant, plus I didn't have any money to go and buy a farm. So I worked  in the supply chain for a while. I went and knocked on the door of one of the biggest  kind of fruit distribution companies in Australia to do office fruit and asked them to put me  
**[0:04:59-0:05:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:04:59):**  into the market. So I spent three or four, almost four and a bit years in Footscray and  then Epping Wholesale Markets, learning about how that worked, particularly horticultural  and fruit and fresh produce and getting to know a bunch of people in those supply chains  
**[0:05:18-0:05:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:05:18):**  and I guess trying to find an entry point somewhere into farming. And I ended up doing  my own online little veggie box scheme, organic veggie box scheme one day a week to get to  know more organic producers and let a whole bunch of those guys know that at some point  
**[0:05:42-0:06:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:05:42):**  I want to get a farm. And eventually there was a point where I was doing buying and trading  and procurement both for my own little online shop and for three or four other organic stores  and one larger one in particular. And that kind of the opportunity came up from there.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:06:03):**  I got a call one day saying this organic mushroom farm has fallen over. Can you do anything  about it? And at the time I was about to scale an online grocery offering for one of these  stores in particular. And the guys that I was doing that for said, look, you can pick  
**[0:06:24-0:06:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:06:24):**  one or the other. You can just do an online grocery thing and we can try and scale that  or you can get a mushroom farm. And for them, this mushroom farm falling over would have  meant that they didn't actually have any mushrooms on the shelf and that there would have been  
**[0:06:39-0:06:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:06:39):**  a significant shortage of stock nationally, organic mushrooms. And I love mushrooms and  they said they would help bankroll that endeavor. And by that time I guess I'd saved up enough  money to go to Harvey's with them effectively. And so we went and started a mushroom farm  
**[0:06:59-0:07:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:06:59):**  and that's really it. But yeah, it was not a, it did not come from a family farming background  or anything. I'm a city slicker, was raised in town and kind of spent holidays and stuff  at family farms. My godparents were wheat and sheep farmers and I knew I wanted to farm,  
**[0:07:17-0:07:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:07:17):**  but yeah, that's the short version of the story.  So I'm just imagining, what were you doing before you even went and knocked on those  doors? Did you have another job and then you came home one day and were like, I'm going  
**[0:07:30-0:07:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:07:30):**  to try to go work in wholesale produce and your family or I know you have a wife now,  I don't know if you did at the time, was like, sure, I support that decision. How did that  actually, what was that decision like?  
**[0:07:44-0:07:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:07:44):**  So my wife's been really good about it the whole time. She was my partner at the time.  We'd been together a little while and she thought I was nuts still, but she had confidence  that I'd be able to figure out whatever pathway that was going to work. But I'd done like  
**[0:07:58-0:08:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:07:58):**  a bachelor of business with a major in entrepreneurship and I was either going to go into like finance  or management consulting or I'd started a business at the end of uni in kind of sustainable  transport and marketing and media used to sell the marketing media and advertising space  
**[0:08:14-0:08:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:08:14):**  on the trans on those, these pedal electric vehicles I had in town. But I really didn't  resonate. And as I said, I was kind of moving in this direction of starting to do some consulting  gigs and doing management consulting or finance. And yeah, it wasn't where I wanted to go.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:08:36):**  And I guess the beauty of knocking on the door of this company and getting in the markets  kind of 3am to 10am each morning meant that I had the rest of the day to start planning  and thinking and researching and self-educating and doing a whole bunch of other stuff. So  
**[0:08:54-0:09:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:08:54):**  I wasn't sleeping a whole lot, but I had a bunch of free time during the day to learn  about stuff that I was interested in.  And how about when, oh sorry, I get the, I mean, I know you a little bit, not super well,  
**[0:09:10-0:09:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:09:10):**  but that kind of follow your passion and figure it out and kind of do that self-education  is something that you are good at. And I wonder what it was like for the, when the opportunity  to get the mushroom farm came up, like same kind of thing. You just came home one day  
**[0:09:23-0:09:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:09:23):**  and were like, right family, we're going to go be organic mushroom farmers. And they were  like on, on board with that. What was that conversation and decision like?  Yeah, that was interesting. So because that, I guess that also, I was pretty passionate  
**[0:09:40-0:09:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:09:40):**  about the, like the food distribution system at that stage as well. So I'd learned a lot  about how those wholesale markets have worked. I'd taken a view that we could use kind of  digital networks to be a bit more effective and efficient in terms of allocating and price  
**[0:09:57-0:10:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:09:57):**  discovery and product discovery. And now is running pretty much headlong into that. As  I said, I was, you know, it was only maybe a couple of weeks away actually. We were from  changing what we were doing, which was a one day a week, pack up a bunch of veggie boxes  
**[0:10:15-0:10:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:10:15):**  and ship them out to people who bought them online from us. And we were kind of doing  the packing of the delivery and I was doing the buying of the markets. We were doing the  whole lot. That was about to go to like a six day a week operation with the top, you  
**[0:10:26-0:10:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:10:26):**  know, 800 grocery SKUs from the store that I was working with. And you know, hire 15,  20 people straight away and really run at that opportunity. And that's what everyone  around me assumed that I was running hard at that time. So I guess when I said to all  
**[0:10:44-0:11:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:10:44):**  those people, change of plan, I'm moving to Bendigo and I'm going to buy a mushroom farm.  They were like, okay, that's not, are you sure? But it was pretty easy to rationalise  because it was like, all right, you do the online grocery thing, you're going to be competing  
**[0:11:03-0:11:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:11:03):**  directly with, you know, Coles and the Woolworths of the world. And there was talk about Amazon  coming and that's, you know, that's a hard thing to do and cost lots and lots and lots  of money to do it at scale and to do it efficiently and effectively and properly. Whereas the  
**[0:11:19-0:11:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:11:19):**  mushroom thing was like one other organic mushroom farm in the whole country and this  guy and there was kind of a clear need and I loved fungi and I loved mushrooms and I  was confident that with the support of this other store, they were going to buy a third  
**[0:11:37-0:11:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:11:37):**  to half of the crop on any given week and that I could find markets for the product  and grow it and that that was an opportunity that kind of, I just couldn't pass up. So  when I explained it in those terms to the people around me, they were like, okay, fair  
**[0:11:51-0:12:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:11:51):**  enough. And my in-laws, my wife or my, yeah, my wife at the time, we were married, I don't  remember. We were almost married. But her grandfather was actually a strong mushroom  grower in his village in Vietnam and was like, you know, the mushroom guru back in the day  
**[0:12:11-0:12:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:12:11):**  in the kind of sixties and seventies. And so my mother-in-law and their family were  like, it resonated with them too. They were really supportive. They were like, okay, you're  going to do mushrooms. You know, there was some kind of cultural memory link back to  
**[0:12:28-0:12:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:12:28):**  her formative years. So they were quite supportive of it. And it just, it worked really well  apart from me having to move to Bendigo for a couple of years and my wife having to work  in Melbourne. So we were apart for lots and I was working 18 hours a day and driving all  
**[0:12:46-0:13:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:12:46):**  the stuff to my markets and stuff that was full on, but they were really supportive ultimately.  That support has got to be so crucial. I mean, in any kind of new venture, whether a farm  or not. So really great that you had that and the kind of family connection. I imagine  
**[0:13:00-0:13:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:13:00):**  like if I told my parents I was going to go be an organic mushroom farmer, I think they  would, you know, not knowing anything about that space, probably not have the same reaction.  So good to have a bit of that, that support. I want to ask about the farm and like what  
**[0:13:14-0:13:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:13:14):**  it looks like to farm mushrooms, but I wanted to touch on one thing you said before that  some of the other farmers you were working with were struggling with the kind of finance  and business side. Why do you think that is? Is that a new thing that farming is getting  
**[0:13:28-0:13:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:13:28):**  more complicated or business is getting more complicated or is it that those are new requirements?  They didn't used to have to think so much about the business or what like what's kind  of happening there and do you think that's new or not new?  
**[0:13:42-0:14:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:13:42):**  I don't think it's new, but I definitely think it's been kind of exacerbated in the last  handful of years. So as kind of some of the big grow up scale, just small and medium sized  market garden type operations, they have to do more with less and with, you know, with  
**[0:14:02-0:14:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:14:02):**  less staff, expensive labour costs. But I think ultimately just like, yeah, there was,  there's a general, when you're dealing with a perishable good and you've got, you know,  48, 36 hours to bring it to market, you invariably end up a price taker. And on one side you've  
**[0:14:20-0:14:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:14:20):**  got the weather squeezing you, which is a massive factor you can't control. You've got  banks and finance squeezing you on the other side. Again, another massive factor you have  very little control over. And then you've got wholesale markets that are structured  
**[0:14:34-0:14:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:14:34):**  where a lot of the wholesale agents, they're playing a spread, but they don't care necessarily  like their business model isn't harmed necessarily by there being volatility in the price or  massive swings up and down in supply and demand. And you know, if you've got 10 kale growers  
**[0:14:54-0:15:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:14:54):**  and all those kale growers grow too much tail or too many beans or whatever, your business  model is fine. And so there hasn't been, in fact, probably even better. So there wasn't,  what I saw is like the best drivers to feed back through those networks, like all those  
**[0:15:13-0:15:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:15:13):**  networks are siloed and the data flow about market demand and consumer demand is fragmented  at a retail level, fragmented at the wholesale level, fragmented at the farm gate. So you  end up with this dynamic of producers who more or less based on what they know how to  
**[0:15:31-0:15:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:15:31):**  grow, they grow a whole bunch of it, send it to the market and hope for the best. And  they're not necessarily responding directly to the real demand because they can't find  out what that is. It just doesn't flow. That information doesn't flow back through the  
**[0:15:47-0:16:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:15:47):**  network or through the chain. So there's a whole bunch of factors. And then yeah, as  you said in the first instance, they've got to run a whole business around just growing  food. Growing food is a pretty hard thing in and of itself. We're doing it well and  
**[0:16:00-0:16:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:16:00):**  doing it efficiently and sustainably is a tough thing to do. You throw in a whole bunch  of other dynamics around business operations and admin and all the rest of it and it's  a tough gig. So I just figure over the last 15, 20 years that's been amplified and made  
**[0:16:20-0:16:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:16:20):**  even harder. And a lot of the guys, a lot of the families who were unable, I guess,  to adjust and adapt to those dynamics slowly bleed out of the system and the family farms  and the businesses that are left have to run harder and faster and more efficiently and  
**[0:16:40-0:16:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:16:40):**  managing more factors. So I always thought there was better ways that we could kind of  design what was going on in those food systems to provide better feedback, better market  data to producers and try and match demand and supply up in advance. And I was doing  
**[0:16:58-0:17:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:16:58):**  a little bit of that with the organic store I was working with before this farming opportunity  came up. So I started dealing directly with a whole bunch of producers rather than through  the wholesale market. Not for everything, but for like the big core lines that we turn  
**[0:17:12-0:17:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:17:12):**  over a lot of and we were able to look at our till data and say, hey, we sell this many  bunches of kale a week. So can you grow us this many bunches of kale a week and this  is a price that works for us and the price that works for you. Go ahead and do it. So  
**[0:17:27-0:17:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:17:27):**  just trying to take out some of the blind action that takes place in the chain.  Tough, tough problem to solve there.  Yeah. And I know you're trying to solve it now in kind of a more technology driven way,  
**[0:17:41-0:17:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:17:41):**  which we'll get into in a bit here. I love that you knew how hard it was and knew the  kind of tough spot that farmers are in having to, like you said, run harder and work harder,  produce more with less and you still wanted to go start a farm. So that's good. Not a  
**[0:17:58-0:18:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:17:58):**  tough job to take on. I'm curious about like describe an organic mushroom farm, your organic  mushroom farm. If I walk in, is it like, am I inside? Am I outside? Is it big? Is it small?  Mushrooms are a thing to me where I feel like I know what they look like in nature when  
**[0:18:14-0:18:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:18:14):**  I see them growing on a log and I know what they look like in a bag. And I have no concept  of what happens anywhere in any of their form. So kind of describe what that looks like.  It's not uncommon. So mushrooms are like, they're a closer organism to human than, well  
**[0:18:34-0:18:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:18:34):**  than anything else really. We're actually really closely related to fungi. We take in  oxygen and a bunch of other nutrients and we exhale carbon dioxide effectively. So in  our context, we grow an agaricus, we grow a few agaricus varieties, which is a lot of  
**[0:18:52-0:19:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:18:52):**  the common button cup barbecue flats that you see at the supermarket. We grow it on  effectively chook, seed, straw and gyptom. So we take agricultural waste streams from  chook farming operations and from wheat and cereal. We can use a bit of canola, but mostly  
**[0:19:12-0:19:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:19:12):**  we use wheat straw because that's a particularly good combination of inputs for growing the  agaricus variety. We have a good composting facility where we mix chook, seed, straw and  gyptom together in rows and rigs. A lot of that, the first phase of that happens outdoors.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:19:30):**  We then put them into giant tunnels and those tunnels are climate controlled. We pasteurize  the compost up to around the seven years degree-ish mark and that sterilizes it to the degree  that we kill a whole bunch of pathogens and competing bacteria and stuff that we don't  
**[0:19:53-0:20:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:19:53):**  want getting into our growing substrate. We then inoculate that with the spawn that we  want. So little bits of grain, barley or wheat that have been colonized with the particular  type of mushroom that we're growing. We mix through that compost substrate. We then take  
**[0:20:15-0:20:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:20:15):**  the compost to our growing site, which is like giant bridges, indoor growing rooms,  bridge panelling and in those grow rooms there is shelving. We move all the substrate, the  growing medium into those shelves and then over a period of about three weeks we take  
**[0:20:36-0:21:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:20:36):**  two crops off that growing medium. So we control in the rooms or we attempt to control the  CO2, the humidity, temperature, the airflow and how much inside outside air is moderated  through the equipment. So we're effectively trying to recreate the same environment that  
**[0:21:01-0:21:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:21:01):**  when you see mushrooms pop up when you're wandering through forest is that there's a  buildup of CO2 in the soil at the higher levels where the mycelium has extended from the grain  spawn, colonized the rest of the compost substrate and built up to a certain point that the organism  
**[0:21:25-0:21:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:21:25):**  that wants to fruit and reproduce and that's when the mushrooms pop up with the idea that  they'll drop spores everywhere and reproduce their organism. So we're trying to manipulate  the environment to get it so that what happens in that natural environment happens in that  
**[0:21:42-0:22:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:21:42):**  room and we get a whole bunch of mushrooms pop up and we pick them, put them into punishment  boxes and send them to stores. So it's all indoors, it all looks like a giant apple cooling  rooms with shelves in them effectively and a bunch of computers bolted onto the end of  
**[0:22:01-0:22:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:22:01):**  the rooms and it's a bit of a black art. Yeah, it sounds really like a combination of some  of the kind of traditional foundational science and you know biology and kind of natural systems  with some pretty high-tech gear to make it all work so it's an interesting kind of combination.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:22:23):**  A couple like basic questions, so that waste, do you guys buy that waste in or is it a waste  stream that otherwise would get kind of thrown out? Where do you get that from? The mushroom  industry's made a rod for its own back because it was initially a waste stream that people  
**[0:22:40-0:22:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:22:40):**  would pay to get rid of but now we've created enough demand for mushrooms that we've got  to buy it. But we kind of, it works very symbiotically between the businesses. It's like we, the  price that we pay for it is very fair, it's not a massive price and we're doing those  
**[0:22:57-0:23:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:22:57):**  businesses, particularly the chook farm, the huge favour taking all that chook poop away.  They can kind of turn it into fertilisers and send it through other parts through the  agricultural chain but ours is, I guess we consider it a higher and a better use because  
**[0:23:13-0:23:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:23:13):**  we can develop a much more nutritious product in the shorter life cycle from that. The straw  is an interesting one, it's like we're not so bad down in Victoria and we're careful  to kind of forward contract our straw 12, 18, 24 months out in advance for at least  
**[0:23:31-0:23:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:23:31):**  kind of 80% of our needs. And then the kind of floating bandwidth we procure it as we  need it but the drought's been a real kicker up north and we'll be interested to see what  happens over the next few years I guess. Hopefully the rain breaks sooner rather than later but  
**[0:23:47-0:24:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:23:47):**  as the grades of straw and hay that other parts of the agricultural chain purchase and  use for livestock and other purposes become more and more and more scarce, the grade of  straw that's available to us or to the industry generally at the same price is diminished  
**[0:24:08-0:24:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:24:08):**  and then that obviously translates into the quality of the compost and the yield that  you can get off it. You end up paying more for a lesser quality product that delivers  you a lesser yield in the end. And so I guess for the agaricus mushroom that we grow that's  
**[0:24:27-0:24:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:24:27):**  you know probably 99% of the mushrooms produced in Australia probably even more actually definitely  by weight and volume, they're dynamic to the industry's going to have to deal with. Every  other mushroom has its like optimal substrate that we started playing around with a whole  
**[0:24:45-0:25:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:24:45):**  bunch of different exotics that we have some pretty cool plants for and they're all grown  on different varieties of substrate depending on what's optimal for the particular organism  same way as kind of when you wander through the bush you'll see clusters of a particular  
**[0:25:00-0:25:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:25:00):**  fungi on a certain type of log or around a certain cluster of plants that they'll grow  symbiotically with. So to kind of identify different waste streams from different agricultural  outputs and we're doing a bit of work trying to find some native ones as well that work  
**[0:25:22-0:25:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:25:22):**  with kind of easily, cheaply, readily available waste streams from native sources as well.  Wow, how cool.  Yeah, agaricus is the one where there's like 30 or 40 years worth of global research highly  
**[0:25:39-0:25:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:25:39):**  developed and refined in the west and northern Europe and North America and stuff but there's  like thousands of other fungi that are not well researched or understood. So we're doing  a bunch of work trying to do that.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:25:55):**  Very cool. So some opportunities there. I'll be excited to see what we get on the shelves  here in the next couple years. I'm curious about the, so just quick one, how big is the  farm and how frequently do the mushrooms grow? Like what's the kind of rhythm that you can  
**[0:26:12-0:26:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:26:12):**  harvest? Yeah, that kind of end cycle and yeah, how big is the farm?  We have, it's big. Well, it's big relative to what I thought these farms produced when  I got into the game and didn't know much about it. We have one little like really tiny farm  
**[0:26:31-0:26:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:26:31):**  but the tiny farm produces like two tonnes a week of mushrooms and then we have a small  farm and the small farm produces like 10 to 12 depending on the growing cycles. So all  in all we're producing, call it 12 on average a week between the two farms, tonnes of the  
**[0:26:49-0:27:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:26:49):**  Caracas mushrooms, which kind of sounds like a lot but some of the bigger grow-ups are  doing 50 tonnes a week, 100 tonnes a week. One of the bigger listed companies is soon  to open up another 150 tonne facility a week.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:27:08):**  And it would all be grown in the same kind of format? Like how much of what you guys  are doing is unique because of your kind of new entry into this and science brain and  all of that? Like are you into a lot of stuff that's different or is this a pretty tried  
**[0:27:21-0:27:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:27:21):**  and true mushroom farming system? Yeah, that Agaricus one has said that's pretty  tried and true methodology. There's a lot of kind of knowledge sharing in and amongst  those farms. The Australian industry is pretty small in terms of numbers of players and everyone  
**[0:27:38-0:27:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:27:38):**  knows each other. What's different for us I guess is we do it organically. So we do  it without chem and bug sprays and fungicides and the supplement. So the supplement that  goes into the vast majority of mushroom farms around the world is soy based protein that  
**[0:27:57-0:28:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:27:57):**  say GM soy invariably. So we can't use that obviously in a certified organic system. We  likewise negate the use of a fungus diet like a selective fungicide that most producers  will put into the substrate or into the casing soil layer on top of the compost. And that's  
**[0:28:18-0:28:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:28:18):**  the kind of preventative measure to ensure other types of competing fungi or disease  and stuff don't grow. We can't do that and then if you do get any kind of bug problem  and other little critters coming and wanting to eat your mushrooms that are growing on  
**[0:28:35-0:28:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:28:35):**  the bed. If you're not organic you can kind of close all the doors up and spray the rooms  and you'll kill all the bugs. We have to rely on super vigilant hygiene in the rooms and  we have really good staff and our pickers and our teams are like hyper conscious and  
**[0:28:55-0:29:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:28:55):**  aware of that. So we kind of have foot dips in and entries and exits to all the areas  with cleaning stuff down daily. Very thorough clean in the rooms in between crops. We steam  all the rooms out to sterilize them. All the staff have kind of you know hairnet rubber  
**[0:29:13-0:29:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:29:13):**  gloves, lab coats. It looks like a bloody hospital half the time. And we just have to  rely on that because if we get any of those disease or bug vectors or whatever that come  into the farm we don't have the tools to whack them on the head the same way as the conventional  
**[0:29:31-0:29:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:29:31):**  guys do. We're already 15-20% down in yield by not having that supplement. And then we  also cut our production cycle generally five or six days shorter than the conventional  guys because it's that last handful of days where all the disease vectors and the fungi  
**[0:29:48-0:30:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:29:48):**  vectors start kind of hitting J curves. So we need to cut it off before then whereas  a conventional farm can push it out another six, seven days and get another little harvest  out of the substrate. So we just don't do that. Right and did you make the decision  
**[0:30:05-0:30:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:30:05):**  to do organic because the farm was already like that because of the price premium like  it sounds like in most organic farming systems that there's a bit of extra work involved  and it can at least from a labor perspective can be more costly if not from a you know  
**[0:30:21-0:30:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:30:21):**  you mentioned decreased yields. So how did you kind of think about that economic analysis  and what else informed the decision to do organic? Well for me I don't know what I can't  speak for everyone else I guess but for me it was definitely the it was that was the  
**[0:30:38-0:30:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:30:38):**  starting point like so I had to make the economics work based on the principles that I have of  how I wanted to farm. I'd been learning a lot about that so that same learnings I discovered  about soil biology and fungi and stuff I was doing a whole bunch of research into how that  
**[0:30:57-0:31:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:30:57):**  affects the human biome and I got bacteria right now and human health so I wanted to  produce food without the use of a bunch of those cams and inputs that I thought potentially  having negative impact on human health and also kind of the soil profile and capacity  
**[0:31:19-0:31:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:31:19):**  for soil to grow and facilitate mycelial networks. So that was the starting point and then it's  like okay you got to make the unit economics work from that point there's enough of the  demand and enough of a consumer base out there who likewise hold that view about their own  
**[0:31:36-0:31:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:31:36):**  health and who are seeking out products that have grown with production systems like that  and the opportunity I guess to learn from this guy who'd run this organic mushroom farm  for 20 years and was a very good grower but not necessarily the best operator and it was  
**[0:31:55-0:32:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:31:55):**  so we could kind of come in and help with that business side of it and the marketing  of the product and distribution and finding new markets and product formats and packaging  and all that kind of stuff and learn as much about the actual growing and production from  
**[0:32:09-0:32:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:32:09):**  him that I could in the time that we had him and so it was really wasn't it I guess I didn't  give myself a choice in the sense I just wanted to do it organically from the start, figure  it out backwards from there.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:32:22):**  Yeah right, made it work. Interesting, so tell me briefly Chris about the kind of technology  that you guys use on the farm. I know I saw a cool video of you recently with kind of  some of the end of supply chain technology that you're using in terms of packaging and  
**[0:32:38-0:32:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:32:38):**  I imagine there's you know control systems like is that all stuff that was available  and you guys bought or did you have to design some of it like give me the kind of tech 101  on the farm.  
**[0:32:48-0:33:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:32:48):**  Bit of both so I guess mushroom industry is probably like you know IoT you know trendy  now and people are designing kind of good hardware that can be deployed in broad acre  type operations and stuff but mushroom industry was lucky in the sense that kind of controlled  
**[0:33:04-0:33:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:33:04):**  rooms controlled environments so custom-built computers for growing mushrooms have been  around for like 30 years that we've already had IoT and we've already had it connected  to you know sensors devices connected to computers and internet to help with the grow up but  
**[0:33:20-0:33:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:33:20):**  it still kind of ends pretty much well not even at the farm gate it ended internally  in the farm gate so not fully integrated with the RPs and business processes and systems  and the rest of it so figuring out how to tie a bunch of that data to our ERPs and get  
**[0:33:36-0:33:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:33:36):**  better insights into the grow up stuff.  They've been working with actually another former young farmer of the year Jan Weidra  from Australian Greenleaf Herb we're doing an implementation of this software at the  
**[0:33:47-0:34:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:33:47):**  moment to integrate with our mushroom growing software but a lot of that a lot of those  tools were pre-existing where I guess I looked to some other technologies was when we had  to scale the business to make all the unit economics work and which meant supplying to  
**[0:34:09-0:34:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:34:09):**  major supermarkets and then when you're supplying to the major supermarkets obviously we have  to put it into pre-packs and those pre-packs need to be differentiated at the till and  marked explicitly as organic so that meant we're using a hell of a lot of plastic which  
**[0:34:26-0:34:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:34:26):**  did my head in.  As I said we're a small farm and we're still churning through a lot of plastic that took  me like 18 months to scrape around the world to find a cardboard punnet solution like you  
**[0:34:40-0:34:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:34:40):**  can just whack them in cardboard but if you just whack them in cardboard punnets and wrap  them up the cardboard's going to go soggy pretty quickly and go to crap that looks bad  on the shelf and customers won't buy it and you end up with a lot of waste so kind of  
**[0:34:54-0:35:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:34:54):**  defeats the purpose and so I found the company that had embedded like a vegetable resin into  the cardboard pulp before they constructed the punnets and that gives it kind of rigidity  and stability and actually even better shelf life than the plastic that had been developed  
**[0:35:12-0:35:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:35:12):**  with a mushroom company in North America and they had certain rights over it and I had  to beg for them to let us use it which was good they ended up letting us using it so  we had our first container of those arrive like 10 days ago and we're playing around  
**[0:35:31-0:35:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:35:31):**  with them now and we hope them to be in stores literally in the next week or two and then  the other factor dealing with the supermarkets was that look at the fact that every horticulturalist  and fresh produce particularly veggies and some of the more sensitive fruits has to deal  
**[0:35:50-0:36:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:35:50):**  within their supply chain which is temperature abuse and so I was working with a couple of  guys from SproutX a guy Dave who had like a former banking data market architecture  background and Daryl who was playing around with a lot of IoT devices so we were trying  
**[0:36:07-0:36:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:36:07):**  to design a system that would let me track my mushrooms from the farm gate all the way  through to the retail point and understand who had them when, where, how and how they  were treating them so what the temperature of that product was at any given point so  
**[0:36:23-0:36:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:36:23):**  that it didn't get abused and the stock didn't get ruined because we were you know we even  had another one last week we have really high grade high quality mushrooms leave the farm  in pristine condition and then by the time they get to the supermarket DC they've been  
**[0:36:39-0:36:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:36:39):**  punished and they get rejected and sometimes.  And what happens then Chris in that case does it get back to you like you don't get paid  or what's the implication there?  
**[0:36:49-0:37:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:36:49):**  Oh yeah no you don't get paid no stock just gets rejected and it becomes your problem  that's like you've either got to pay to get it collected from that warehouse from the  DC again you're paying for like storage and transport and it's kind of useless to us anyway  
**[0:37:06-0:37:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:37:06):**  because at that stage a highly perishable good even if we did get it back to ourselves  or another market by that stage it's you know non-saleable or very very low value so in  effect we donate it to you know second bite or food bank or one of those kind of operations  
**[0:37:23-0:37:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:37:23):**  depending on where the DC is and we have to write it off but for the most part it's like  yeah it's no fun but worse than that is that even if you know even if you do have stock  that may not necessarily it might arrive at the DC and look fine and the temperature's  
**[0:37:44-0:38:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:37:44):**  fine and the transport companies crank the fridges a few hours before it gets delivered  and so when the supermarket receives it it looks like it's all good but it's been abused  at some point through the chain and by the time it gets onto the shelf or into the customer's  
**[0:38:00-0:38:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:38:00):**  basket and back to their house and fridge it goes to crap way earlier than the best  before date would indicate or something like that then the customer has a really bad experience  they don't like the brand of mushrooms or berries and they don't like the store that  
**[0:38:12-0:38:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:38:12):**  they went to and maybe they don't go back to that store for ages and so there's all  these cascading effects for the producers and for the retail and channel partners where  no one really knows what's going on in the chain and it's all siloed and everyone's  
**[0:38:31-0:38:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:38:31):**  responsible but no one's accountable and you can never tell who or why or what's gone  wrong and so we were trying to build out a solution for that and I guess we started with  that because it was a serious pain point for me personally in our business but also I have  
**[0:38:49-0:39:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:38:49):**  this general view that there's better ways to organise and allocate like I was saying  before and figure out what we should be growing and when and where and how much of it and  we can't really do any of that until we get good data flow up and down the network of  
**[0:39:05-0:39:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:39:05):**  these food supply chains but getting that data flow means getting producers and retailers  and distributors to start using some common ledgers and some common software and some  common databases and that's an expensive thing to do and who's going to pay for that and  
**[0:39:23-0:39:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:39:23):**  why would they and who makes the first move and which stakeholders do you need to get  involved so we were looking at all of those dynamics.  I was just going to say I agree I imagine like I've had this conversation with a few  
**[0:39:37-0:39:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:39:37):**  growers in different industries around this problem and I think it's worse in horticulture  and you've obviously felt it from different points in the supply chain but what made you  decide to do something about it?  
**[0:39:49-0:39:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:39:49):**  Was it that one incident?  Was it meeting some tech people with that kind of capability?  This is a somewhat known issue but a complicated one to solve as you said so why did you decide  
**[0:39:59-0:40:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:39:59):**  to actually do something about it?  Well I'd wanted to do something about it for like seven or eight years so I'd always had  that view coming in needed when I was doing the online stuff myself I'd always had that  
**[0:40:11-0:40:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:40:11):**  view that we could use digital networks and some of the digital tools and capability to  mimic kind of what mycelium does in a rainforest or in a biological environment figure out  what needs to go when where and how and do that more effectively so it always had this  
**[0:40:25-0:40:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:40:25):**  nagging sense that it could be done and this seemed like an obvious entry point because  there's so much waste in the chain and it's such a significant pain point and there's  kind of dollar amounts that people could put onto it and what made me try and do it ourselves  
**[0:40:42-0:40:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:40:42):**  or the people I was working with was all the tools that were available out there where  people were trying to solve for this were a lot of them were built by like really really  smart people with really high technical capabilities but didn't have good understandings of the  
**[0:40:57-0:41:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:40:57):**  processes of the chains and what farmers are dealing with on a day to day and what supermarkets  and the supply chain partners and the carriers are dealing with on a day to day so they designed  all these tools and processes that for a variety of reasons I never thought was ever going  
**[0:41:10-0:41:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:41:10):**  to get any adoption and so I kind of approached one of our major supermarket partners were  working in the process and said went to my quality people and said hey we want to try  this they said no way but we do have a team working on that and you can chat to them so  
**[0:41:30-0:41:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:41:30):**  I got chatting to that those guys in the Woolworths business and they spent like 18 months working  on the Woolworths end of the problem and designing internal processes and systems that had the  capability to solve this but they had never they hadn't got to the point of thinking okay  
**[0:41:49-0:42:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:41:49):**  this is the technology and hardware that we can use to track and monitor this but what's  the actual commercial model and how do you get all these stakeholders involved and so  we had we had some ideas about that and that I guess was the genesis of you know forming  
**[0:42:04-0:42:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:42:04):**  the Escabox business with those guys leaving Woolworths and coming and joining us to try  and solve it at an industry level rather than one retailer or one wholesaler or one set  of producers or which for a variety of reasons we don't think would work.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:42:20):**  So I think that's probably there's two things in there one just so Escabox is a new company  that you guys have actually formed and did you say that those the people that were working  on in Woolworths have actually left to be part of Escabox so you've actually grown a  
**[0:42:34-0:42:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:42:34):**  full team outside of the mushroom farm to build and scale this technology solution that's  right.  Correct yeah absolutely so that look they were doing the same thing internally in Woolworth  
**[0:42:48-0:43:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:42:48):**  Luke and Nikki they were Luke was like head of supply chain technology innovation and  was working on a bunch of projects and Nikki was like headed up this project she was she  kind of owned this piece of work for 18-24 months and had delved into it in a significant  
**[0:43:05-0:43:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:43:05):**  amount of detail it had gone all the way up and down through their chain and category  managers and to their board and all the way to their MD and so they had an understanding  of what the processes and requirements would be so that it would work for supermarkets  
**[0:43:22-0:43:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:43:22):**  and it was they liked working with us because we had all those same understandings all the  way back through their chain but also back through the farm gate and all of us had looked  like I sit on a couple of organic industry boards and we'd looked for different and better  
**[0:43:38-0:43:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:43:38):**  ways and software tools out there to do this they'd gone through like 50 different companies  had walked through the door and come to picture them yeah this is how we should do it and  I've done the same thing I'd called up there was about a of the 50 that I'd gone through  
**[0:43:51-0:44:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:43:51):**  I'd spoken to about 30 of the same ones like you know I'm running a mushroom farming company  in business and we've got a whole bunch of plans for growth I don't necessarily want  to have to do all this but the opportunity was so obvious because all those tools that  
**[0:44:05-0:44:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:44:05):**  we looked at would just weren't informed by the right process design or understanding  of the commercial drivers for all of the different complex stakeholders and how do you tie all  that together and it's like not a not an easy thing to do and we thought we had the insight  
**[0:44:19-0:44:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:44:19):**  and experience and time in those chains to actually do that a bit better so they sorry  again look yeah oh just to interrupt you there do you think that that's something that you  know one of the things that gets talked about in the ag tech world is the lack of domain  
**[0:44:38-0:44:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:44:38):**  expertise or you know too many solutions being developed without a really strong kind of  grounded value proposition do you think that you really need to have worked in the industry  or to you know be a farmer have a farmer on the team or is that something that you can  
**[0:44:52-0:45:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:44:52):**  develop from the outside like obviously it's been a competitive advantage for you guys  and kind of why you've been able to be successful getting the walrus guys on board and kind  of getting that deal done but do you think that's something that other companies have  
**[0:45:06-0:45:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:45:06):**  to have or they can get that expertise another way there's no way around it you've got to  have it and yes you can get it another way but the other way to do it is to embed your  people in those in those operations in those supply chains you got to drapes around to  
**[0:45:26-0:45:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:45:26):**  the farms and spend the time and literally watch the processes that are going on on farm  to ensure your product design reflects what the needs of those operators are likewise  through the supply chain it's just there's so much like labor costs in Australia and  
**[0:45:44-0:46:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:45:44):**  particularly so high and there's so much this a massive drive for efficiency in all of these  parts if you're introducing processes that add heaps of complexity and heaps of additional  work you're just not going to get adoption and the it's very hard to design processes  
**[0:46:04-0:46:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:46:04):**  and systems without having that either having the direct experience yourself or going and  getting parts of your teams developing this stuff embedded what we saw way too much of  was people that conceptually absolutely that understood the problem and theoretically that  
**[0:46:20-0:46:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:46:20):**  understood you know I see it all the time theoretically they understand how it could  be solved and then they go start building and what what I've seen is a big like big  improvement in the space in the last particularly last 18 months even while we've been doing  
**[0:46:35-0:46:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:46:35):**  what we're doing is an awareness of that and a lot more willingness that summer for a lot  of these tech companies and people building agtech tools to do it holding the hands of  the people that are using gonna end up having to use the products whereas prior to that  
**[0:46:52-0:47:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:46:52):**  you saw a lot of people build stuff and then tell the users this is going to solve all  your problems and this is how and that's why there was this big disconnect and all these  users going yeah that's not going to work it's definitely a lot better than it was yeah  
**[0:47:08-0:47:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:47:08):**  good I'm glad to hear you think it's getting better I'm starting to slowly see that change  as well though I'm not sure how quickly it is I think it depends on different spaces  so tell me what's you now have two businesses on your hand one the the mushroom farm and  
**[0:47:22-0:47:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:47:22):**  one escabox the agtech company solving some of the related but broader problems so what's  next in a nutshell for for both of those businesses and for you we're building a new farm for  the mushroom farming company we're building a couple of new farms so one we're expanding  
**[0:47:42-0:48:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:47:42):**  our characters operation to kind of supply the major supermarkets and give more scale  and longevity to that business model and we're also got very like some of the stuff I'm like  super passionate and super curious and interested about is bringing in some like long-term friends  
**[0:48:04-0:48:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:48:04):**  of mine and more recent friends of mine that I've met that have the same obsession with  with fungi and biotech stuff that we're going to build out of four labs and we're going  to do a whole bunch of cool stuff with fungi biotech and functional foods and medicinal  
**[0:48:19-0:48:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:48:19):**  foods and value-added foods from different mushrooms born mycelial varieties and so that's  watch that space I've got a couple of actually I've got a couple of other businesses that  are going to come and try cool stuff at our farms so I know at Olympia you know quite  
**[0:48:39-0:48:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:48:39):**  well we're going to go some bugs off our off our mushroom muffcocks and substrate just  trying to make the highest and best use of all our outputs so there's there's a whole  there's a whole whole interesting bunch of stuff going on in the mushroom farming company  
**[0:48:57-0:49:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:48:57):**  and then for Escabot we are we're doing another fundraising round at the moment which is going  really well and it's all good fun and we have pretty grand plans to provide a bunch of these  solutions in Australian chains and then into Southeast Asia and Asia as well and even potentially  
**[0:49:17-0:49:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:49:17):**  now we've got some potential partners knocking on the door from Europe but really working  with a lot of those producer groups and industry bodies to make sure that that platform and  that product first thing we do is is solve this temperature abuse supply chain visibility  
**[0:49:33-0:49:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:49:33):**  into wind issue and as we're solving that we can then begin to kind of enrich that data  stream and that data set that everyone has visibility to by adding a whole variety of  other different data set to that what's going on behind the farm gate what's going on through  
**[0:49:51-0:50:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:49:51):**  the chain what's going on through the consumer end and really trying to build out a platform  the framework that allows for that dynamic I was describing earlier where we have a much  better idea and all the participants in the chain can see what they should be growing  
**[0:50:04-0:50:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:50:04):**  when where how and and matching that to consumer needs and the retailers needs that's a yeah  that's a big project we've got we've got pretty bold and audacious plans there and I guess  watch watch this space will be a little little more of that coming out over the next month  
**[0:50:24-0:50:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:50:24):**  or two.  Sounds like we have about seven spaces to watch just to keep up with what you're doing.  Super impressive Chris, really cool.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:50:33):**  Where can people go to learn more about what you're doing to get involved in any of those  various initiatives or just kind of to track your your progress as you continue to do all  of this amazing stuff?  
**[0:50:46-0:51:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:50:46):**  Yeah probably need to get a bit better about that do more of the social stuff I'm on Twitter  at mycelia organics our website mycelia at the moment is more or less a placeholder with  my phone number on it so if you want to get in touch with me go to myceliaorganics.com.au  
**[0:51:04-0:51:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:51:04):**  and escovox.com is where there's the first simple version of communicates what we're  doing about temperature temperature abuse in the cold chain and or you can track me  down on LinkedIn but yeah always happy to hear from from people working in those chains  
**[0:51:24-0:51:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:51:24):**  and who maybe share some of the same problems that we've had and that other producers have  and that are interested in streamlining how their supply chains work and how they manage  their kind of quality assurance and accreditation and certification please come rattle my cage.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357334#t=0:51:39):**  Fantastic awesome Chris well thank you so much for coming on the podcast and I am looking  forward to seeing how all of this evolves it sounds like it is moving very fast and  so we'll have to have you on again in a couple months here to get an update.

**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:00:19):**  agriculture, science and anything else you can think of and we can find in the world  
**[0:00:23-0:00:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:00:23):**  of agtech.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:00:24):**  We'll look to demystify it so that we're getting to the so what.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:00:27):**  What does it really mean for farmers and for the broader agricultural industry?  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:00:32):**  I'm farming and I grow it.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:00:38):**  I'm farming and I grow it.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:00:42):**  Well Kevin Huyckes, welcome to the BushTech podcast.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:00:45):**  Thanks so much for joining us.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:00:46):**  No, Sarah, it's a pleasure.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:00:48):**  I've been following you on Twitter and we've had a couple of conversations and I'm excited.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:00:54):**  I am as well.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:00:55):**  I love following you on Twitter actually and in preparing to talk to you today, I totally  
**[0:01:01-0:01:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:01:01):**  got sucked into your blog.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:01:02):**  So I definitely want to talk to you a little bit about your personal journey as well and  
**[0:01:07-0:01:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:01:07):**  some of the writing and reflecting you've been doing.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:01:10):**  So hopefully that's okay but maybe we'll start a little bit with your professional background  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:01:15):**  and what you're up to in the agtech world.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:01:20):**  I think when you look at the background that I have, so many people in the agtech space,  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:01:27):**  it's like we've grown up in the ag world and so I grew up on a cattle operation in Southern  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:01:32):**  Colorado and when I came up, the internet was just becoming a thing.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:01:37):**  So to put things in perspective, I just turned 40 and I sent my first email when I was a  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:01:42):**  senior in high school and really didn't comprehend the internet until I really got to college.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:01:47):**  So I consider myself a young person but the internet and technology has changed so dramatically  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:01:53):**  over the last 18 years.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:01:55):**  So I think that's kind of the first perspective but my background is simple.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:01:58):**  I grew up in a cattle operation, always loved agriculture but the operation was not big  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:02:04):**  enough to go back to.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:02:05):**  So from the time that I went to college, I was looking for a way to bridge my passion  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:02:10):**  of agriculture and then I got my first computer when I was in the sixth grade and I said this  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:02:15):**  is really cool stuff.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:02:16):**  So I liked ag and I liked technology and a lot of times people either like one or the  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:02:20):**  other so I just kind of found this niche and that's how the career started.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:02:24):**  That's a fantastic story and I guess it's probably still true.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:02:28):**  I don't know if you would disagree that there are still not that many people who kind of  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:02:33):**  have one foot firmly planted in both of those worlds.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:02:36):**  Like it's increasingly a space where people have a tech background and an ag background  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:02:42):**  and are bringing that together but it's still not a super common journey I would say.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:02:47):**  What's your experience been?  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:02:49):**  I think that's right.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:02:50):**  The term that I would use is like there's art and there's science and what happens,  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:02:55):**  my dad for example doesn't use a lot of technology so he'll go walk to the fields every single  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:03:00):**  day and he'll step back and say I don't necessarily see the value in a lot of this technology  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:03:05):**  because I'm out in the fields and there is value in that.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:03:08):**  And then I have a lot of friends in Silicon Valley, I was at Commodity Classic last week  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:03:12):**  and talked to a lot of my tech friends and some of the stuff that they're doing is really,  
**[0:03:16-0:03:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:03:16):**  really cool and amazing.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:03:18):**  And the reality is that when you blend the art and the science, if you take the art of  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:03:25):**  my dad walking in the field and the science of what the technology can do and you blend  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:03:29):**  those together, to me that's where we find success and that's what our company and that's  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:03:34):**  what has been my passion and vision for my career is just trying to bring both of those  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:03:38):**  together.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:03:39):**  I think that's what we have to do more of because the art, the person that's walking  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:03:43):**  just the field not using technology, I don't think they're 100% right.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:03:48):**  And if you're designing an application and you're sitting in a conference room on a 4G  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:03:53):**  network and an air-conditioned office, you're probably not grasping what's going out in  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:03:57):**  the field.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:03:58):**  So I think we got to bring both of those together and that's the world that I kind of live in.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:04:01):**  Yeah, I think that's so right.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:04:04):**  So maybe, I mean, you have a bachelor's in Ag from Colorado State and a master's in agribusiness  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:04:09):**  and really have been in this world a long time in multiple ag tech companies.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:04:13):**  So I want to get to intent into farm trials, but just maybe briefly on your background,  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:04:20):**  having been in the ag tech world, really this intersection of the art and science for many  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:04:25):**  years now, how have you seen the space changing and evolving now that there's so much focus  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:04:30):**  on ag tech in places like Silicon Valley and outside of agriculture, more in the tech world?  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:04:36):**  Yeah, I'll give kind of three different realms.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:04:40):**  So my first venture into ag tech began with a company called Vantage Point.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:04:44):**  Have you ever heard of Vantage Point?  
**[0:04:45-0:04:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:04:45):**  No, I haven't.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:04:47):**  Okay.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:04:48):**  Late nineties, it was John Deere Farmland and Growmark.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:04:52):**  And when I was in college, this company was stood up and I was like, this is the coolest  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:04:57):**  thing ever.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:04:58):**  And we were talking about data warehousing and information and how farmers could do things  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:05:02):**  better and really was being able to visualize commodity prices and being able to kind of  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:05:06):**  visualize things through the internet.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:05:09):**  Imagine a time when you're talking about the things that we're doing today, but at that  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:05:13):**  point in time, there was no smartphones, there was no high speed internet.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:05:18):**  We would go into meetings, Sarah, and the biggest thing, we had these PowerPoints, right?  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:05:23):**  And the idea was if we could go into a meeting and the PowerPoints had so many graphics,  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:05:28):**  which are screen captures from the web, if PowerPoint didn't crash, we'd consider it  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:05:33):**  a successful meeting.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:05:35):**  And then it ventured into, man, if we get internet connections.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:05:38):**  And now it's like, Hey, if I can do a live video conference, that's success.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:05:43):**  So that's where this started.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:05:45):**  And what's interesting is that to me, it feels like we're just now starting to execute on  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:05:50):**  some of those ideas that we dreamed up 20 years ago, that the industry dreamed up.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:05:55):**  So I think in some ways it is going a lot faster, but in some ways the industry does  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:00):**  take a while to adopt.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:02):**  And the reason that we say that is because we get one chance a year to do something.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:06):**  So when you look at kind of my background and experience, it starts there at vantage  
**[0:06:10-0:06:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:10):**  point.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:11):**  And then the second phase was the dot com days.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:13):**  And so when I came through the dot com phase, you know, you couldn't, there were, there  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:18):**  were amazing job opportunities and we were flying around on private planes and companies  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:22):**  were talking about going public.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:24):**  And there was this internet and this dot com revolution that happened.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:29):**  Well, what that drove, it drove innovation and it drove a lot of the ideas trading grain  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:33):**  online.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:34):**  It drove the ability to buy inputs.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:36):**  All of those initiatives and ideas started then, but a lot of those companies either  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:41):**  didn't make it or they evolved.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:43):**  So I think that dot com phase was the next phase that really said, this is what the vision  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:47):**  of what it could look like happened.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:50):**  And now we're going through a lot of the same things.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:52):**  There's a lot of companies that are doing really cool things in ag tech and AI and machine  
**[0:06:56-0:06:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:56):**  learning.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:06:57):**  And what you see today is not what it's going to look like in three to five years, but many  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:07:02):**  of the concepts that we're designing will actually be the things that benefit agriculture.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:07:07):**  So I think it is going faster, but we have to understand that the runway to me over my  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:07:12):**  20 year career, it's a, it's a longer runway than, than some people think getting into  
**[0:07:17-0:07:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:07:17):**  it.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:07:18):**  Yeah, I think that's an important one to understand.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:07:20):**  And I mean, you've been through not only the, the, these different areas of enabling technologies,  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:07:26):**  but also some like real experience, you know, working at a company that did get acquired.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:07:31):**  So really the full life cycle now, co-founder of a startup company, working with startup  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:07:35):**  companies and you know, consulting.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:07:38):**  So you've been in a couple of different size businesses and different spectrums.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:07:41):**  I wanted to ask about, I guess kind of the nitty gritty just on on farms technology that  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:07:48):**  you are a part of that got acquired and just kind of that journey from, you know, an early  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:07:53):**  company to an acquisition now that that's the, the kind of goal for many companies in  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:07:58):**  the tech world.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:08:00):**  What was that journey like for you?  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:08:02):**  And you know, seeing it kind of from, from end to end, or at least that, that end of  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:08:06):**  it and that integration with a bigger company.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:08:09):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:08:12):**  So I've been a part of four startups and I have so many friends that are part of others.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:08:16):**  And the thing that I've realized is that every single one of them is different.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:08:21):**  And so the, the, the journey at farms technology was an amazing story and that was, you know,  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:08:26):**  over 10 year period.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:08:27):**  And really what I learned there is that we focused again, it goes back to that company  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:08:34):**  was developed out of ideas that came from farms.com when we were trading online at farms.com.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:08:40):**  That one didn't necessarily make it.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:08:42):**  But what I learned is that a small team that was focused and, and had a farmer relationships  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:08:48):**  with partner with farmers could actually be successful, but it took 10 years to get that  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:08:53):**  company off the ground and lifted.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:08:54):**  And we just kept iterating and listening to growers and kept driving towards it.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:00):**  The thing on that one is that we were not, I don't consider that a venture funded company.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:06):**  I consider that funded by an angel investor initially.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:09):**  And then as DuPont invested at DuPont Pioneer invested in the company, then what you see  
**[0:09:14-0:09:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:14):**  is more of a strategic investment.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:17):**  And Sarah, it was so much fun and it was fun not because of the acquisition side.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:22):**  It was fun because there were farmers that would call, you know, it'd be a Thursday night  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:26):**  and the markets were open.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:27):**  They were able to get their grain traded.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:29):**  And when a farmer customer calls you and says, you've made my life better, you've created  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:33):**  something amazing.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:34):**  There is no better feeling for an entrepreneur to say, I've created something of value here  
**[0:09:39-0:09:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:39):**  and I'm helping people.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:41):**  That was what I enjoyed most about that opportunity.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:44):**  It's so interesting you bring up the sort of balance between customer pressures and  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:49):**  satisfaction and value and investor value.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:51):**  I mean, that's kind of one of the implicit tensions and especially in terms of timeline.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:09:57):**  So you hit on kind of venture backed companies and not venture backed companies and what  
**[0:10:02-0:10:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:02):**  that changes in terms of their timeframe.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:04):**  I'm curious.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:06):**  I think that's your thought on that space.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:09):**  And there is a lot of venture capital activity.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:11):**  I think the latest AgFunder data just came out that it's more than ever and bigger deals  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:17):**  and more deals and more types of investors.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:19):**  I know I have conversations with venture capital investors all the time wanting to understand  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:23):**  ag and ag tech and get in this game.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:25):**  Do you think that that's a good fit in terms of types of capital or what are the limitations  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:31):**  and challenges or maybe even also opportunities?  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:35):**  Like what's the kind of pros and cons of taking venture capital in this space?  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:41):**  I've never actually been through a true venture funded.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:44):**  When you think about some of the stuff that's happening today.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:47):**  So lots of money that comes in quick.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:50):**  What I would say is the good part about that is to me it's made ag sexy again.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:56):**  So you have a lot of people that want to get involved in agriculture now because they see  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:10:59):**  this investment coming in.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:00):**  And I think that's a wonderful thing.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:03):**  The other thing that I see is that you could talk about, you look at AgFunder or the deals  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:07):**  that you see.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:09):**  Every one of these technologies that's out there, whether it's a drone application, satellite  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:13):**  imagery application, any kind of a device or hardware.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:19):**  When you look at what they do, all of them are achieving a value.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:22):**  If you really understand what those companies are doing in these venture backed entities,  
**[0:11:27-0:11:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:27):**  they're achieving value.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:28):**  I don't believe that in the end there's too many choices right now and not all of them  
**[0:11:33-0:11:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:33):**  will make it.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:34):**  But we will find the market will settle out and the farmer customer won't be rival gets  
**[0:11:39-0:11:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:39):**  adopted.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:40):**  So I think it's a good thing.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:41):**  But I just think we have to be realistic and say that it may not look the same in the ag  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:46):**  space as it looks in other markets.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:49):**  But the reality is that innovation is happening and without that investment, without that  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:54):**  excitement it wouldn't happen as fast as it is.  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:11:58):**  That's such a good point and I talk a lot about new perspectives and talent and capital  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:12:04):**  coming into the space.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:12:06):**  And yet I guess one thing that still happens a lot and you've done the same thing on your  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:12:10):**  LinkedIn and in starting out today was like reinforcing that you do come from the ag industry  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:12:16):**  and grew up on a cattle operation.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:12:20):**  I guess I'm curious because if you in the world outside of ag, if you said I'm a fourth  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:12:25):**  generation banker or I'm a fourth generation engineer, that doesn't hold very much credibility  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:12:30):**  and you wouldn't care that someone has come from that family.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:12:34):**  But in ag that still matters so much.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:12:37):**  And I guess as someone who didn't grow up on a farm, I find myself tempted to play up  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:12:41):**  the fact that I've spent time on farms or get that credibility.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:12:45):**  And I don't know, do you think you need it and why is that still so important when it's  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:12:51):**  also important and exciting that new perspectives are coming into the space?  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:12:57):**  I think it helps to get your foot in the door when you're talking.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:02):**  For us, we work with two clients.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:04):**  We work with farmers through our farmertrials.com platform that we pay to do research and those  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:08):**  are our partners.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:10):**  And when I can pick up the phone and work with people, for example, Jill Mathewitz,  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:14):**  I've worked with them for 20 years in different spaces.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:17):**  And we just have that relationship that we understand the ups and downs of the industry  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:21):**  and understand what we've been through.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:22):**  So we don't have to start from ground zero.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:25):**  It's like, what are we trying to attack?  
**[0:13:26-0:13:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:26):**  I feel that that's the first thing that helps me.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:29):**  The second thing then is our clients that pay us, that fund intent and that do the research.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:36):**  Those businesses like to have someone like us that understand the complexities of the  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:41):**  industry because ag is so unique.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:45):**  And the difference is that you can't look at it and say, this is the way that it worked  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:48):**  last year.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:49):**  This is what's going to work this year.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:50):**  An example is last year, March 1st, we thought we were going to have a premier planting season.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:55):**  Well in most of our areas, we had rain that came in for two and a half, three weeks that  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:13:59):**  put us way behind.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:14:01):**  That happens every year because we deal with mother nature and we deal with those elements.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:14:04):**  I think understanding, there's something about having that background and understanding.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:14:09):**  We understand what the customer, the farmers are going through that makes it easier.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:14:15):**  But I'd say it's not so much like grew up in ag, it's just that I've also spent the  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:14:18):**  last 20 years working side by side with these people.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:14:22):**  Maybe you just call it street credibility.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:14:24):**  They're like, I'm the only one that's crazy enough to stay in this stark space.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:14:29):**  I think that's right.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:14:30):**  And that distinction is important.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:14:32):**  I think just the credibility and time you spend to really understand it and empathize  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:14:37):**  with the uncertainty and the changes and how it is different and that what works in technology  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:14:43):**  outside of ag might not work in ag.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:14:46):**  But I do want to talk about intent and farm trials.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:14:48):**  So you alluded a little bit to what you're doing there.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:14:52):**  So tell us about both companies or both aspects of what you're up to and differences and how  
**[0:14:59-0:15:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:14:59):**  they fit together.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:00):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:01):**  And really the conversation that we've been through, talking about my background and what  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:08):**  I've seen and where I've seen success with farms technology, that's what's led to intent  
**[0:15:13-0:15:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:13):**  and then ultimately farmer trials.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:14):**  And I would love to tell you that farmer trials was our idea, but actually that came from  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:18):**  farmers.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:19):**  So in my career, the best ideas that we've ever executed against actually came from clients.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:24):**  I want to give our growers credit.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:26):**  Yeah, you started telling us a little bit how your journey so far led you to that.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:31):**  But yeah, would be great to hear about how you've gotten to where you are and what that  
**[0:15:37-0:15:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:37):**  looks like.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:39):**  So the purpose of intent, it starts with the companies that we work with.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:43):**  Their main question is, will this product be adopted?  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:47):**  And if it gets adopted at the farm level, how long is it going to take to get adopted?  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:52):**  And then farmers on the other side of the equation, they simply want to know how well  
**[0:15:55-0:15:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:55):**  does this stuff work?  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:57):**  So it doesn't matter what they're looking at testing.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:15:59):**  They want to know how quickly or how well it works.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:16:02):**  So that's the gist of our company and the way that our company works.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:16:07):**  Randy Barker is like I said, a co-founder because of his time at Monsanto.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:16:11):**  He would work through the commercialization of products and what he never had the ability  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:16:16):**  to work with a company that could do data analytics that could go out and engage with  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:16:20):**  growers and could also run the field trials as well as listening to farmers throughout  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:16:25):**  the entire process.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:16:26):**  So he saw this need at Monsanto and I think that's where the vision started.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:16:31):**  So you start with Randy and then the second leg of the stool is our data analytics.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:16:36):**  So Alice Robinson is a PhD statistics person that started studying ocean waves and she  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:16:41):**  looks at data in a different way than anyone I've ever seen.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:16:44):**  And as long as you have that person that can analyze data, but the cool thing about Alice  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:16:49):**  is that she'll, like today alone, she was on the phone with three different growers  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:16:52):**  with me looking at their fields, setting up trials, talking about heteros.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:16:57):**  There's very few data science individuals that can talk farmer and then relate it back  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:02):**  to the data science almost.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:03):**  That's number two.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:04):**  And then my background is simply being able to commercialize this stuff.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:08):**  So being able to talk to farmers and then say, what are the applications that are out  
**[0:17:11-0:17:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:11):**  there?  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:12):**  You know, someone that if we're going to look at CRM systems or systems that have already  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:16):**  been built, our goal is don't build anything that anyone else has already built, utilize  
**[0:17:21-0:17:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:21):**  the technology that exists.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:23):**  And so most startups, and Sarah, you've probably heard this, they'll start with an MVP, right?  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:27):**  A minimally viable product.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:29):**  What is the most minimal thing that we can build?  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:32):**  Take it to the market and test.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:33):**  What we built at Intent was an MBT, a minimally viable team.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:38):**  And so it was data science.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:40):**  It was someone that understood commercialization and it was someone that could tie the farmers  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:44):**  and the applications together.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:47):**  So we started with that and that's how Intent was born.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:50):**  That is, I think that's kind of again, reinforces the importance of this, like one foot in one  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:56):**  world and one foot in the other.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:17:57):**  In your case, you know, three feet or three legs of the stool where you can bridge the  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:01):**  gap between these different worlds and kind of speak the same language, but translate  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:05):**  things in a way that it makes sense to whether it's tech stuff to ag or ag stuff to tech  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:09):**  or all that to a business case.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:14):**  That kind of translation is so important.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:16):**  What's it like having three co-founders?  
**[0:18:19-0:18:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:19):**  Is there ever a two against one situation?  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:22):**  Is three a good number of co-founders?  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:25):**  I would say yes.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:27):**  And I think that we were just lucky that we were all available at the same time.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:31):**  And all of us think differently.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:33):**  You know, I'm the details person as a project plan and a timeline for everything.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:37):**  Randy is going to be much more of a visionary that's thinking out there.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:40):**  And we all respect one another.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:43):**  But I will tell you that I've never been part of a startup or a small business that was  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:47):**  bootstrapped.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:48):**  And this business was formed at a time when we decided we did not want to take capital.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:18:55):**  We said, if we can go out and create value from customers, let's build it that way.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:00):**  And there's something philosophically about building a company that's built around the  
**[0:19:04-0:19:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:04):**  idea of the customer is the answer.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:07):**  And what we say, we're just trying to get the answer for the customer.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:12):**  And I think that philosophy is what drives us and helps all of us.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:16):**  We all think differently and yes, we disagree.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:19):**  But at the end of the day, we know that what we have to do is perform for the customer.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:23):**  And that's what's pretty cool about it.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:25):**  And so what does this look like?  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:27):**  So you use trials, obviously, but is that agronomic products as well as digital products?  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:32):**  And where are you seeing the kind of pull either from the farmers or on the startup  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:38):**  or company side trying things?  
**[0:19:40-0:19:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:40):**  Where is their kind of momentum?  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:42):**  Is it really across the spectrum or there are certain products that you're seeing more  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:45):**  and more desire to try or to have tried?  
**[0:19:49-0:19:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:50):**  So I'll give you three examples of projects that we work with.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:54):**  A lot of times you talk to companies like, well, what the heck do you do?  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:19:57):**  And so for us, I'll give you three examples.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:00):**  So one of our first projects that we worked on initially was a project with Bayer.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:05):**  And the idea for that project was to go out and recruit growers that could be part of  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:09):**  a fungicide trial and also beta test a software platform.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:13):**  So that was a cool one because we were doing software and we were also doing a fungicide  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:18):**  test.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:19):**  There's a cool video that's on LinkedIn that kind of describes that process.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:22):**  And what was cool about that one is you were connecting both a fungicide and a product.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:28):**  And when I listened, not from our perspective, but what farmers liked is that they had all  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:32):**  this equipment and their idea was, I have this equipment that can do all these cool  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:37):**  things and I bought it because of this.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:39):**  But now because of this trial, I'm actually able to put that into practice.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:43):**  Lots of the farmers told us, I can actually use some of the hardware and some of the software  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:47):**  that I have to do this.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:48):**  So that was number one.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:50):**  A second project that we work on, I'll give you an example of a startup.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:53):**  So Pivot Bio is a client that we work with in California.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:20:57):**  They're developing a microbial product that allows for nitrogen development in corn.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:21:05):**  This one's really cool.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:21:07):**  And you go talk to farmers and say, we've got a product that's a microbial that's going  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:21:11):**  to help with nitrogen in your crops.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:21:14):**  That gets farmers excited in a hurry.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:21:16):**  And so farmers are, they're reading about these new ideas, these new concepts.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:21:21):**  They love being able to be involved in something like that on the front row of that.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:21:25):**  A third one is a company in Kansas City that we work with called Compass Minerals.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:21:30):**  And we're doing a couple of different trials with them.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:21:33):**  One is with a product called WolfTrax and one is with a product called ProAqua.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:21:39):**  Again, when I go talk to farmers, what they say is we like these trials because we're  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:21:44):**  looking for these kinds of things.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:21:46):**  What they're looking for, Sarah, is not the home run.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:21:50):**  They're looking for one or they're looking for singles and maybe some doubles.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:21:53):**  And they say these are the kinds of things that I think can put me five or 10 percent  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:21:57):**  ahead of everyone in my county.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:21:59):**  And the thing that they ask us foremost is that we do compensate farmers that sign up  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:04):**  on farmertrials.com.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:05):**  We compensate them because of their time and because we want them to follow protocols.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:10):**  But the most important thing that they're after is data.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:13):**  They say at the end of these trials, I want to see how well it worked on certain soil  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:17):**  types.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:18):**  I want to see how it worked in different fields, whether it's aggregate or local.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:22):**  That's what they're trying to figure out.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:23):**  And I think as long as we keep providing that kind of value back, that's how we're going  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:27):**  to help the industry.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:28):**  So those are just three different projects that we work on that kind of give you an idea  
**[0:22:32-0:22:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:32):**  of how our company functions.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:34):**  Yeah, that's fantastic.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:35):**  And I think pretty unique.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:37):**  I mean, that's kind of how we first connected is around this trial concept and around the  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:42):**  fact that there's a lot of expectation that we'll just build this stuff and then we'll  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:46):**  get people to use it.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:47):**  And that works when you have an app or a new website or maybe even a consumer product.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:52):**  But in Aglet's core to your business, you're not just going to say like, hey, can you just  
**[0:22:57-0:23:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:22:57):**  go out of your way to completely try all these things that would be helpful to me?  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:23:00):**  So you really have to find that value for the farmers and you guys are paying them.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:23:06):**  Does that limit or change your client base on the trial or side?  
**[0:23:11-0:23:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:23:11):**  Like are startups able to pay?  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:23:13):**  Is it more big companies?  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:23:15):**  What kinds of trends are you seeing on who's able to A, see the value of what you bring  
**[0:23:20-0:23:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:23:20):**  in and B, take advantage of it and actually build in that compensation model?  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:23:27):**  You actually hit on something that we think about as a business a lot.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:23:31):**  I will be one of the challenges that we have as a business is that startups or companies  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:23:36):**  even that come out of accelerators, they call us because now I've got my MVP and I want  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:23:41):**  to go to the market and they've seen our stuff in AgFunder and Successful Farm.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:23:45):**  They've seen our articles like, hey, can you help us?  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:23:47):**  The problem is because we're not funded, that we have a revenue model in place.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:23:52):**  And one, they have to pay for these trials.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:23:55):**  And number two is that these trials typically take eight to 12 months to run through full  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:00):**  cycle.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:01):**  And I think there's a gap and I don't know the answer yet, but there's a gap for these  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:07):**  small businesses that maybe don't have the R&D budgets as a more well-funded startup  
**[0:24:12-0:24:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:12):**  or even a multinational.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:14):**  I don't know how we get there, Sarah.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:16):**  And I think that's a conversation we continue to have because there are some really cool  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:19):**  products that we see and some amazing entrepreneurs that I'd love to help.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:25):**  But the timeframe and the runway just doesn't quite match up.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:29):**  And so how that works, if you've got ideas, I'd certainly be interested because there  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:33):**  is a gap there and you identified something that we think about and it just hurts because  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:37):**  you're like, how can I help this company just go for one trial season and give them some  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:43):**  data as to how well this works in these types of conditions?  
**[0:24:46-0:24:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:46):**  There's an opportunity there.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:48):**  Yeah, it's a conversation I've been having quite a bit recently and now I've seen a couple  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:53):**  models, one where the farmers are not paid, that's sort of a volunteer basis, hey, you  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:58):**  want to get involved?  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:24:59):**  And I think that really limits the farmers who are going to be willing and able to do  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:03):**  that.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:04):**  It's going to limit the quality of the data.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:05):**  And a point you hit on there that's, I think, an important subtlety is that you want them  
**[0:25:09-0:25:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:09):**  to follow protocol.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:11):**  You want these to be rigorous trials and sort of a hypothesis and a test and a validation  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:16):**  of it and analysis after.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:18):**  And if you don't have commitment to follow that protocol, then you're not going to get  
**[0:25:22-0:25:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:22):**  the kind of quality of the data analysis that you need.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:25):**  So I think that's really important too.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:27):**  Yeah, look, I don't have the answer.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:30):**  I think it's really interesting and we'll see how this changes when there's more recognition  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:35):**  of the timeframes that agriculture is going to take and of what startups need to do this.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:41):**  I think the exciting thing is that you are getting interest from startups and that there  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:45):**  is a willingness to say, how do we get on farm?  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:48):**  How do we go have these conversations?  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:49):**  How do we try things out and then really get this data instead of saying, we'll do things  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:54):**  in a couple of small lab plots or you can stay in the lab and not get on farm?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:25:58):**  So I guess it's baby steps, but progress in the right direction.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:26:04):**  No, absolutely.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:26:05):**  I think that's one of the things that we think about and there's certainly an opportunity  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:26:09):**  there.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:26:10):**  But at the end of the day, it has to work for the growers.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:26:14):**  And one of the things that you probably hear about is integration.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:26:18):**  How do these tools work together?  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:26:19):**  Because the growers that we work with, they're also testing other, someone that's collecting  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:26:25):**  data and using advanced systems and understands this.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:26:30):**  Because we work with them, they're also working with other companies out.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:26:33):**  There's not a lot of innovators that you can go pull from.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:26:37):**  And so looking at how do we tap into those innovators and know that they're only going  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:26:41):**  to be able to do a certain number of trials and test a certain number of things every  
**[0:26:45-0:26:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:26:45):**  year, we have to be cognizant of their time and figure out how do we get the most trials  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:26:52):**  and test the most technology per growing season.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:26:56):**  Yeah, that's exactly right.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:26:58):**  And even just managing that.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:27:00):**  And it's interesting, have you seen, like there are those kind of early adopter farmers  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:27:04):**  as we call it, that have put their hand up and that are trialing things already and are  
**[0:27:08-0:27:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:27:08):**  hungry for more of this stuff.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:27:10):**  Are there more farmers and maybe different farmers than you would have thought or saw  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:27:15):**  at first coming in because of the platform that you've created, because of the ability  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:27:18):**  to get paid and make it easier and slightly less risky to try new things?  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:27:23):**  Are you creating more farmers looking to go on this journey?  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:27:28):**  Well, yeah, we paid 100 farmers last year in different capacities.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:27:33):**  So once you do that and we gave them data back, so that was the first thing.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:27:38):**  That kind of helped seed it, but most of our work today becomes a part of our agtech network  
**[0:27:44-0:27:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:27:44):**  and its relationships.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:27:46):**  And what you start to find is these growers, they run together.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:27:49):**  So if they're using this kind of software over here, they're going to these conferences.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:27:54):**  And once they go through a trial with us and they say, I really like how they ran their  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:27:58):**  trials, it was organized, there were protocols, there were expectations, then they'll refer  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:02):**  us to someone else.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:04):**  And it seems like they're like minded growers that run together.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:08):**  And we could always use more, but for us, it's all built off relationship.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:13):**  FarmerTrials.com, it's a great place to get a few people that come in that fit it.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:18):**  But the reality is that it comes from word of mouth and people have actually worked with  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:21):**  us and know us.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:23):**  And what's the role of social media?  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:25):**  I mean, you're pretty active on Twitter and I forget, maybe that's how we even first connected.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:30):**  But what's the role of social media in this world where that is a place that people are  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:34):**  getting advice and having these conversations and potentially making those referrals?  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:39):**  How does that fit into the business side or is that more the kind of social and network  
**[0:28:44-0:28:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:44):**  and community side?  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:47):**  For us, it's how we built our business.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:50):**  Candidly last year, our marketing budget was $800.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:53):**  That's what I spent on digital ads.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:28:55):**  And I looked at people, I looked at farmers and said, who do we really want to get this  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:00):**  message?  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:01):**  We're talking about specific growers in areas and we say, let's get our message in front  
**[0:29:04-0:29:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:04):**  of them.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:05):**  We don't have hundreds of thousands of followers.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:07):**  That's not the objective, but we know who the right people are that we want to get in  
**[0:29:11-0:29:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:11):**  front of.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:12):**  So we work strategically on the farmer side, number one.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:15):**  And then number two is on the business side, we say, who are the influencers that we want  
**[0:29:19-0:29:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:19):**  to be surrounded by?  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:21):**  And with an $800 marketing budget to be able to get in AgFunder, to be able to be in successful  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:26):**  farming.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:27):**  And we were also asked to go to DC and testify that tells me that we're getting our message  
**[0:29:32-0:29:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:32):**  out in front of the influencers.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:33):**  So for us, it's about being targeted and being strategic.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:37):**  And for us, we actually spend more time building listening systems and listening to what people  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:42):**  say online as compared to what we put out there.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:45):**  So for us, we feel that everyone's talking online, but there's not a lot of people listening.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:50):**  And so let's just make up an example here.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:52):**  Let's say that we're doing a seed trial.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:54):**  There's no better place to go and listen to people talking about pros and cons of a seed  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:29:58):**  placement that they're talking about on Twitter and say, hey, we actually have a trial that  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:30:02):**  fits that.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:30:04):**  When you can tie those two pieces together, to me, that's how we found value.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:30:09):**  Yeah, that's super important.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:30:11):**  But you said you went to testify.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:30:14):**  I feel like I can't let that go.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:30:16):**  What were you testifying on and what was that like?  
**[0:30:19-0:30:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:30:19):**  Yeah, it was a joint session between the small business and the Ag committee.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:30:29):**  And so we went to DC and it was just a really cool time.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:30:31):**  One, it validated for Alice and Randy and myself that what we were doing was important.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:30:36):**  And we talked about how as a small business, we can help revitalize.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:30:41):**  We're sending money back into the farms and communities and actually paying innovators.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:30:45):**  And so that was the message that was well received.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:30:48):**  And then number two is all the things that we talk about, looking at how agriculture  
**[0:30:51-0:30:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:30:51):**  is advancing and how we're helping the industry.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:30:54):**  It was just a cool chance for us to bring awareness to what's happening in Ag.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:30:58):**  And then also as a company said, yeah, what we're doing is filling a very unique gap.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:31:05):**  And it was just good for our business to mature to that level.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:31:10):**  That's fantastic.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:31:11):**  So what does the future look like here?  
**[0:31:15-0:31:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:31:15):**  Possibly more than an $800 marketing budget.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:31:17):**  Are you guys going to expand to different geographies to a bigger team?  
**[0:31:22-0:31:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:31:22):**  Are you going to digitize a lot of this?  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:31:24):**  What does five years or maybe 10 years down the road look like?  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:31:29):**  And what does that look for you personally?  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:31:31):**  Are you still involved day to day in the business or have you moved on to something else?  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:31:37):**  But what's the future hold to the extent that that's even a thing you can predict?  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:31:42):**  Yeah, no, I'm absolutely involved every day.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:31:46):**  And so we always talk about, Randy, Allison, I always talk about working in the business  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:31:51):**  versus on the business.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:31:53):**  So when you're in the business, you're building a CRM system, you're making sure the emails  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:31:57):**  go out, you're making sure the drip campaign is set up.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:31:59):**  You're calling 10 farmers that haven't uploaded data yet.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:01):**  That's what the day looks like.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:03):**  I get to do that.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:04):**  And so I built that from the ground floor.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:07):**  Randy is working on the finance piece of the business.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:10):**  He's working on writing blends.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:12):**  So he's working in the business.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:14):**  Alice is absolutely working in the business, making sure that we have protocols set up.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:18):**  And then last week when we go to Commodity Classic, we pull up and say, what does this  
**[0:32:22-0:32:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:22):**  business look like in one to three years?  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:25):**  And so last year, while we did a significant number of the heavy lifting, this year we  
**[0:32:29-0:32:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:29):**  implemented a program called our Ag Tech Network.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:32):**  So if you look at farmer trials, you can see some of the Ag Tech leads that we have.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:36):**  And these are the people that have one, strong technology skills and two, they're located  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:42):**  in markets that when we say, hey, we've got this trial, we can go to our Ag Tech leads  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:47):**  and say, how realistic is this?  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:49):**  And who are the growers that have the kind of equipment to facilitate this?  
**[0:32:52-0:32:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:52):**  So we started to scale from that perspective.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:55):**  And the question that you asked is strategically what we're talking about.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:32:59):**  How do we scale this business?  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:01):**  So we've grown the business.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:02):**  We've got a business that's revenue positive.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:05):**  And what we're working on now is how do we build better systems and how do we invest  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:10):**  in those systems in a way that allows us to continue to do more trials?  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:15):**  What that looks like and exactly over the next five years, I don't exactly know.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:20):**  But the scaling piece is how do we continue to replicate and grow and find more answers  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:25):**  for both businesses and farmers.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:27):**  That is what we spend our strategy time working on today.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:31):**  Well, Kevin, I look forward to seeing that all come together and maybe we can keep chatting  
**[0:33:37-0:33:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:37):**  about ideas on how to scale, it's an important one.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:40):**  And I think that this business in particular has huge potential to really continue to connect  
**[0:33:45-0:33:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:45):**  the Ag and Ag Tech worlds and really deliver value for farmers.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:48):**  So I'm really excited about it.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:50):**  And I really appreciate your time today.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:51):**  You've mentioned it a couple of times, but just where can people find more about what  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:54):**  you're doing if there are farmers who want to try or companies who want to have stuff  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:33:59):**  trialed or other expertise from you guys, where can they find you?  
**[0:34:03-0:34:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:04):**  So all farmers that are interested in doing research, paid research, if they meet the  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:09):**  criteria, I would tell all farmers to go to farmertrials.com and that way when trials  
**[0:34:14-0:34:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:14):**  are announced, they're posted there.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:15):**  And then also we'll send out emails letting farmers know which trials are available.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:18):**  So farmers go to farmertrials.com.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:21):**  Our businesses, our company, and maybe you kind of mentioned my background, but starting  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:26):**  at farmland, going to farms.com, there were no farms left, Sarah.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:30):**  So we created a company name that was as far away from farmers possible.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:35):**  The company name is Intent.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:36):**  So I N one zero T and the website is intent.io.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:41):**  And it may be a really great branding idea.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:44):**  Maybe the worst thing we ever came up with, but the idea is that we're intentional about  
**[0:34:47-0:34:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:47):**  data.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:48):**  So we don't go in and try and sell a product or solution.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:51):**  We start with what is the company's challenge?  
**[0:34:53-0:34:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:53):**  Were they trying to solve?  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:55):**  And then we bring all the data elements and we were intentional about the data solutions  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:34:59):**  and data products that we can bring to solve those problems.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:03):**  So it's Intent.io.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:04):**  I'm so glad you talked about that.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:07):**  I had a question on here and when I was thinking about it, where does that name come from?  
**[0:35:12-0:35:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:12):**  And it is really different.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:13):**  We did a map the other day of kind of a bunch of ag tech companies and what we realized  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:17):**  was they're all green and most of them start with A, the logos.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:21):**  And so we had one company that's red and black and they just popped out like the most special  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:26):**  company in the space because they didn't follow that pattern.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:29):**  So you might be onto something there with something that was a bit more meaning and  
**[0:35:32-0:35:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:32):**  not a farm or an ag beginning.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:36):**  Hopefully that turns out to be a great strategy.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:39):**  I hope so because there were no farms left.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:41):**  So we don't know now, but in five years we'll know it.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:45):**  And the thing that we've realized is the name is important, but really in this business  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:51):**  it's still the relationships that we have.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:54):**  That's how the business has taken off and we continue to nurture those and respect those  
**[0:35:58-0:35:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:58):**  relationships.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:35:59):**  Well, Kevin, thank you so much for coming on and sharing your story and some tips.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357340#t=0:36:04):**  Really excited about what the future holds for farm trials and for intent and for you.

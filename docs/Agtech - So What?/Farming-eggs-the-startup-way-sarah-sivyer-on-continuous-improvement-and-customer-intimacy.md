**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast, brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:07):**  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:10):**  In this episode, we asked, how do you like your eggs?  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:13):**  I like mine fried and runny, but everyone has their own personal preference.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:18):**  And that's kind of the point.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:20):**  It's precisely this kind of customer focus that Sarah Sivir, today's guest, is passionate  
**[0:00:25-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:25):**  about.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:26):**  Sarah is an egg and livestock producer, and she started her business, which is called  
**[0:00:31-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:31):**  Just Been Laid, completely from scratch.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:34):**  It was only going to be 450 birds to start with.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:37):**  And so they arrived and I sort of got the shock of my life only because the day they  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:43):**  arrived, it was a 47 degree day, sort of middle of January.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:48):**  And I was just like, oh my gosh, these birds are literally all going to die the first day  
**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:52):**  they get here.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:54):**  Sarah may have been new to eggs at the time, but she was not new to business or to farming,  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:00):**  having grown up on a farm before entering the corporate world.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:03):**  With her venture into eggs, she's using her insights and best practices from the corporate  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:07):**  world, including staying laser focused on what her customers want.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:12):**  In the case of eggs, that's convenience and confidence that their eggs are being produced  
**[0:01:17-0:01:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:17):**  sustainably and ethically.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:20):**  This has led to a very non-traditional business model for agriculture, at least.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:25):**  A direct to consumer subscription service where people buy the eggs even before they're  
**[0:01:30-0:01:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:30):**  laid.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:31):**  Even if you don't like eggs at all, Sarah has some powerful insights about continuous  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:35):**  improvement and the similarities between startups and farms.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:39):**  She's a woman who is not afraid to get up close and personal with her chooks or her  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:43):**  customers.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:44):**  I run a pasture raised egg subscription business up here in the Hunter Valley in New South  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:51):**  Wales.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:52):**  We have about two and a half thousand birds, give or take 500, depending on what part of  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:58):**  the season we're in.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:59):**  But the important part of that, I suppose, is the subscription model where we work with  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:05):**  customers to get paid in advance for the product, a bit like a gym membership or something like  
**[0:02:10-0:02:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:10):**  that.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:11):**  So we run two and a half thousand birds along with about two or 300 head of cattle on a  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:17):**  couple of thousand acres here in the Hunter.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:19):**  That is awesome.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:20):**  Now, have you always been involved in the egg industry?  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:22):**  No.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:24):**  So my career started at university.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:27):**  I studied chemical engineering and commerce, which I absolutely loved.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:31):**  But that just came from a really keen interest in chemistry and maths at school.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:37):**  So there wasn't much else to that decision.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:39):**  Then after a few years at UD there, I actually headed off and worked for the likes of BHP  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:44):**  Billiton on mining sites.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:46):**  And the main thing there is it's probably where I got my love for data, became a bit  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:51):**  of a nerd around data as I studied to be a lean Six Sigma black belt.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:57):**  If you're wondering whether Sarah is a ninja, then no, not quite.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:02):**  That's just how business nerds, myself very much included, describe their level of knowledge  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:07):**  in a process improvement framework called Six Sigma.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:10):**  This approach is all about driving continuous improvement largely through reducing variation  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:15):**  and eliminating waste.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:18):**  While Six Sigma started in the automotive industry and Sarah learned about it in mining,  
**[0:03:23-0:03:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:23):**  she has been applying it to ag.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:25):**  The Six Sigma side really focuses hard on data and looks at variation.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:30):**  So the chemical engineering side was just an absolute fabulous step into the data world.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:35):**  After BHP, did a little bit more study, went and did my MBA over at the University of Oxford,  
**[0:03:41-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:41):**  which helped me transition into where I really feel quite comfortable in the world of agriculture.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:48):**  And yeah, from then on spent the next probably eight, 10 years in corporate agri.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:53):**  Right.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:54):**  So you're sitting at Oxford and you had a passion for agriculture or were interested  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:58):**  in it?  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:59):**  What was the connection there?  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:01):**  So I come from a fifth generation family farm.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:03):**  So having grown up on the farm, I always had, I don't know, everyone just says you've got  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:07):**  in your blood or something like that.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:08):**  I think for me it was like, I always knew I wanted to come back.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:13):**  It's really hard to articulate sort of that feeling.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:15):**  But so for me it was like, okay, how do I make this transition to still be in the corporate  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:21):**  world for a little while?  
**[0:04:22-0:04:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:22):**  I wasn't ready to come home straight away.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:24):**  And there was actually this course during my MBA called Managing Information in the  
**[0:04:29-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:29):**  Bioeconomy and that just really did some really interesting case studies on global agribusiness.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:36):**  And from that I went and worked for Syngenta over in Switzerland who basically at that  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:42):**  point they were kicking off a team called their food security team.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:45):**  This was about 2010 I think.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:48):**  And my boss there was covered up a crush money who went on after Syngenta to then head up  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:54):**  the WWF.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:55):**  She was the global conservation director.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:58):**  So for her, her passion came straight down to let's look at smallholder farmers or the  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:03):**  businesses.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:04):**  Syngenta really wanted a strong focus on pre-commercial smallholder farmers.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:07):**  So that's like farmers with less than two hectares or less than the size of two footy  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:12):**  fields worth of land.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:14):**  And how can we help these guys?  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:17):**  Where are their constraints?  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:19):**  And for us that was just absolutely so interesting.

**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:25):**  of things.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:26):**  So it helped, I only spent a short amount of time there before returning to Australia,  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:30):**  but it was really about how do we look to create business models that can work with  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:34):**  these farmers.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:35):**  Do you have any examples of things that were successful there?  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:39):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:40):**  So for me, whilst I was there early on in the days, like when these projects actually  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:45):**  came to fruition, I think some of the success stories could have been even around production.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:49):**  So production, you're looking at really simple, basic greenhouses, which helped to increase  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:54):**  tomato yields by 400%.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:57):**  And that might sound crazy, but if you've now got protection from the weather or climate,  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:00):**  you can control your climate better.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:03):**  That is an extraordinary jump and such a simple solution.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:06):**  But the next problem these farmers had was how do we actually get our product to market?  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:11):**  So the next problem to solve was more around, do we pick the product earlier, like harvest  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:15):**  the tomato earlier so it perishes less, getting it to market, et cetera.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:19):**  Things like that were discussions around training, production methods.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:23):**  Other business models were around bartering.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:26):**  Others include micro insurance.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:28):**  They're just really simple, accessible solutions based on the things that everyone has.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:34):**  So for example, everyone has a mobile phone or had a mobile phone in that.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:38):**  So creating communication and access to information through those sort of channels, it was really  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:44):**  quite powerful and something that I just learned a lot from.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:47):**  It was nice to be a part of.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:49):**  That's really interesting.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:50):**  And I guess kind of actually is maybe the earlier parts of the continuous improvement  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:55):**  journey for you.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:56):**  It sounds like some of those farms were going on a pretty different, but still a continuous  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:59):**  improvement journey with looking at those different business models.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:03):**  Oh, 100%.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:05):**  And I think we learned, once we picked up the training, like for me, that Lean Six Sigma  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:08):**  work, it was lucky enough to pick it up with BHP, but it's just been literally applicable  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:13):**  in every job we've had so far after that.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:16):**  There's such a strong focus on both data and people.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:20):**  So being able to combine that where possible has been really, really powerful.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:24):**  And to your point, yeah, the farmers that we were working with, everyone just has this,  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:29):**  I mean, things just farming in general, like farmers just have this appetite to continuously  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:34):**  improve, learn about new production methods, learn how to increase yields, learn how to  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:38):**  better deal with the environment that they are in.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:40):**  And yeah, anything we could do there to increase that access to information was really powerful.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:47):**  So you were in Switzerland working for Syngenta, but then how did you end up back on the farm  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:51):**  with your two and a half thousand birds?  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:53):**  So it was a bit of a random jump.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:58):**  So my father got a little bit unwell.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:00):**  So I left Switzerland a little earlier than I had planned to, but that was absolutely  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:05):**  fine.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:06):**  I came back to Oz, I actually came back to the farm to start with, just sort of to help  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:09):**  out here for a little bit, then ended up working for the International Finance, or IFC, International  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:14):**  Finance Corporation as part of the World Bank.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:16):**  Then very similar, sort of smallholder farmer work, very similar to what I've been doing  
**[0:08:20-0:08:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:20):**  with Syngenta.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:21):**  But that allowed me to be back in Australia and working sort of part-time on the farm.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:26):**  And then shifted to Rabobank.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:29):**  I never thought I would work for a bank.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:30):**  I think when I left chemical engineering, like 50% of my class ended up working in fire  
**[0:08:34-0:08:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:34):**  dance and I thought, no, that's not going to be me.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:37):**  And then I ended up working in a bank and it's seriously one of the best jobs I had.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:43):**  I was part of the Food and Agri research team looking after animal proteins research.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:49):**  So you could be traveling around, like I probably spent, I don't know, 20 weeks, it could be  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:55):**  over the course of the year, out with farmers in central Queensland, New South Wales, Northern  
**[0:09:00-0:09:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:00):**  Territory, all over the country, talking about international beef markets and global trends  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:07):**  really.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:08):**  And it's just, it's so interesting.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:10):**  I felt like a complete newbie novice because you're talking to farmers that have been doing  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:14):**  this for 50 years and their knowledge is just extraordinary.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:18):**  So it was a bit of a two way street with information sharing.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:21):**  So I learned a lot from them.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:22):**  And then yeah, after Rabobank, I think that's when you started to get that itch going, hey,  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:26):**  I think it's time to go back to the farm.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:30):**  Left Rabobank, spent about six months doing a heap of due diligence into what I might  
**[0:09:35-0:09:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:35):**  do back here.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:36):**  Yeah, it came down to something that needed to be complimentary to the beef business.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:41):**  We didn't really want to compromise on the beef, but equally I wanted something of my  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:47):**  own sort of almost just to be able to start from scratch, test out and apply a lot of  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:52):**  the learnings from the last 10 or 15 years and see what we could do.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:58):**  And yeah, it turned out to be eggs.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:01):**  And how did that happen?  
**[0:10:02-0:10:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:02):**  Did you guys have hens before?  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:04):**  Like what was the reason for eggs?  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:07):**  Yeah, I really don't have a good answer for this.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:11):**  I need a better answer.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:14):**  It definitely didn't grow up with chickens, learn everything from scratch.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:19):**  Being like research nerd, like it was almost like analysis paralysis.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:23):**  Like, you know, you're sort of doing so much work going, okay, we've got to get this right,  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:26):**  et cetera.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:27):**  And then it just came down to let's just flick the switch.

**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:34):**  it was only going to be 450 birds to start with.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:37):**  And so they arrived and I sort of got the shock of my life only because the day they  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:43):**  arrived, it was a 47 degree day, sort of middle of January.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:48):**  And I was just like, Oh my gosh, these birds are literally all going to die the first day  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:52):**  they get here.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:53):**  But it was literally like that.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:56):**  No, what happened was you sort of go so out of your way.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:59):**  So we were feeding them, feeding the frozen veggies, iced water.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:03):**  I slept in a swag down with the chickens because they're in, I've got to describe this, they're  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:08):**  in mobile caravans.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:10):**  So the mobile caravans parked basically in a rainforest at this point, which whilst it  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:15):**  was 47 degrees out on sort of the main ridge country, it was sort of well down into the  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:20):**  sort of low thirties where the chickens were.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:22):**  So the stresses of setting things up kind of paid off, but there certainly were a few  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:27):**  sleepless nights in a swag just checking on chickens every 20 minutes.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:30):**  Oh my gosh.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:31):**  And they also were getting used to the frozen veggie diet and then we're about to hit reality.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:36):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:38):**  They went straight out.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:40):**  It's really interesting the routine.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:42):**  So we were really, really hands on with the chooks, which obviously lifts our cost of  
**[0:11:49-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:49):**  production.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:50):**  So the hands on approach is like literally when the chickens arrive, they've come from  
**[0:11:54-0:12:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:54):**  a barn, they're about 15, 16 weeks old and we spend the first four nights, only an hour  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:01):**  each night, but there'll be three or four of us that will pick up every bird and put  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:05):**  it on a perch because the birds will naturally be inclined to sort of huddle together for  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:10):**  security and warmth.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:12):**  So we just, it's like going to a gym class and doing 400 squats in 45 minutes and literally  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:18):**  just picking up every bird off the ground, putting it on the perch.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:23):**  And it's amazing.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:24):**  It's like humans, like every other animal, everyone gets into a routine.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:28):**  So night two, probably 50% of those birds realize that bed is in the caravan on that  
**[0:12:34-0:12:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:34):**  perch.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:35):**  So they'll go in by themselves.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:36):**  We'll pick up the other 50% probably only take half an hour or so.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:40):**  Then night three, you'll still have 30 or 40 birds.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:42):**  And by night four, look, you've got a couple of stragglers, but they eventually cotton  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:46):**  on to how things are supposed to go.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:48):**  So after that, the birds, a hundred percent, no matter where we move the caravan, so we'll  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:53):**  move the caravan really frequently just to spread manure, et cetera.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:58):**  The birds will follow and yeah, put themselves to bed at night, which is quite handy.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:04):**  And now is the bird operation integrated with the beef operation at all?  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:07):**  Like when you're saying you're moving them, is that part of a whole system or are they  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:10):**  pretty separate operations?  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:12):**  A hundred percent.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:14):**  That's a really good question.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:15):**  Yes, they're completely integrated.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:17):**  We try to run the cattle sort of before and after.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:20):**  We certainly give the soil or pasture a certain amount of rest, but initially we use the cattle  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:25):**  almost like a lawnmower to keep the grass or pasture short enough for the chickens.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:31):**  If you have certainly long pasture, you find that the chickens themselves get sort of sour  
**[0:13:35-0:13:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:35):**  crop.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:36):**  They just, the grass sort of ferments in their crop and that's dangerous if not sort of lethal  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:40):**  for the chooks.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:41):**  So the cattle move across.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:43):**  We follow the chickens behind and depending on what season as to how quickly the grass  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:47):**  grows again as to when you might bring the cattle back.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:50):**  But we don't really bring the chooks back for five, six months, sort of minimum.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:57):**  More to let the chicken, what the work that the chickens have done.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:00):**  So sort of spreading the cow manure, spreading their own manure, scratching, basically conditioning  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:04):**  the soil.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:05):**  Let that happen.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:06):**  And it's really exciting.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:07):**  I just, sorry, it sounds like a bit of a nerd here now getting excited over this, but anyway,  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:12):**  after that, it's been sort of three or four years or three and a half years now.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:17):**  And being able to look at these pastures from above and now that we've actually had some  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:23):**  rain, it's been some pretty dry summers or dry times recently.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:27):**  You just can see this, what will be the long term benefits because it's really obvious,  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:33):**  like very, very obvious sort of dark green, yellow where the chickens, like the boundaries  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:37):**  between where the chickens have been and haven't been.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:40):**  And I think that combined with us trying to increase our diversity in the pasture species  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:45):**  is that look, it's a long term game, but really trying hard to integrate it and still learning.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:51):**  You mentioned costs before and like that's all your workers out there doing their squats  
**[0:14:55-0:15:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:55):**  is probably not cheap and moving them and just there's a lot there that's quite different.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:02):**  How originally was the business model different to support that or how do you kind of think  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:07):**  about making the economics work?  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:09):**  Yeah, so definitely look at cost of production per dozen eggs.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:16):**  Labor is significant.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:18):**  If I looked at a dozen eggs, I'm actually just doing this off the top of my head, I'd  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:22):**  say three or four of those eggs in the dozen would be worth in the labor, it's cost of  
**[0:15:27-0:15:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:27):**  production side.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:28):**  Another three or four, about three in feed costs because we use a relatively, well, it's  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:32):**  not going to say expensive, but it's more costly than other feeds because it's vegetarian.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:38):**  And then another two or three of those eggs out of the 12 would equate to the cost of

**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:47):**  So yeah, labor is certainly a chunk, like probably a third of our cost of production.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:53):**  But I think the people that buy our eggs, they're buying our eggs for a reason.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:59):**  These eggs don't suit everyone, the cost of them, we sell them for $12 a dozen and that  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:16:04):**  cost doesn't suit everyone.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:16:06):**  I suppose if I looked in Woolworths or Coles at the moment, the average price of free range  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:16:10):**  eggs would be maybe $7 or something like that, just to give people perspective on that price.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:16:16):**  So yeah, the cost, we always knew it was going to be highly labor intensive.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:16:20):**  I think we've learned what needs doing to save us money in the long run.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:16:25):**  Like if I gave you an example, I was only thinking about this yesterday, we've got new  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:16:29):**  birds at the moment and yes, we spent our three or four days perch training, but the  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:16:35):**  next step after that, five or six weeks after that, the chickens come onto the lay.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:16:40):**  And again, hopefully most of them by that stage have found where the nest boxes are.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:16:45):**  So in these caravans whilst there's perches above the perches, there are nest boxes where  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:16:49):**  we really want the chickens to lay their eggs because then the eggs roll away off these  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:16:54):**  nest boxes onto a conveyor belt that we just wind in a few times a day to collect the eggs.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:00):**  So the important bit being there is you 100% want your chickens laying your eggs in the  
**[0:17:06-0:17:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:06):**  nest boxes.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:07):**  If we had a chicken laying an egg on the ground or in a tree, which we've had before, we can't  
**[0:17:14-0:17:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:14):**  use those eggs purely for food safety perspective.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:17):**  That's where you'd be looking at things like salmonella and issues like that.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:20):**  So we just 100% rule out using any egg that is laid, not in a nest box on the conveyor.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:26):**  So if you had a chicken that just from scratch decided to lay her egg up a tree every day  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:33):**  for, let's just round them some numbers, like 200 eggs and our eggs are literally could  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:39):**  be worth a dollar each.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:40):**  So while she only costs us $15 to buy, she's worth $200 in revenue and yeah, there you  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:46):**  go, lost straight away.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:48):**  So if we only would have, after our work of finding those birds and training them, so  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:53):**  we again would only spend sort of target probably about three days in a row an hour again going,  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:59):**  okay, they're all onto the lay and we've got 10 birds that are laying, not in the nest  
**[0:18:02-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:02):**  boxes.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:03):**  Just stand there between probably eight, nine in the morning, it's peak hour.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:08):**  You can watch them.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:09):**  They go, they'll wander over to a tree and they'll be, you can look at it and you're  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:12):**  like, oh my God, you're about to jump into that tree to lay an egg.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:16):**  I would wander over, grab her, she'll squat for me anyway, and then I'll put her in the  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:21):**  nest box.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:22):**  I'll do that two days in a row.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:23):**  And she's like, oh actually this nest box isn't so bad to lay an egg.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:27):**  And for us, so per bird you're saving what, $200 a bird in lost revenue there, 10 of those,  
**[0:18:33-0:18:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:33):**  2000.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:34):**  So me spending four hours doing that is really a decent return.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:39):**  Yep.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:40):**  That is, I've got a million questions on that.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:42):**  That is hilarious.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:43):**  I'm trying to get at the like, don't know, don't go up in the tree.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:47):**  Out of my head.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:49):**  Hilarious.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:50):**  We have conversations.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:52):**  That's too funny.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:55):**  So I want to come back to the $12 a dozen retail.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:58):**  That's definitely not for everyone, but, but you're right.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:00):**  I mean, obviously you're seeing there is demand for that.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:02):**  Tell me a bit more about the business model.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:05):**  And you mentioned the subscription people pay ahead of time.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:07):**  Was that the original model when you first bought the chooks?  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:11):**  So for me it was like, if we're going to do something new or in addition to the beef,  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:16):**  it was really hoping to make the income stream as predictable as possible.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:21):**  So I would get a little bit nervous about producing a product and then for me leaving  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:27):**  it on the shelf in a supermarket or at a store or something like that and hoping it's basically  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:32):**  what it felt like that someone would like the packaging or like the idea of our eggs  
**[0:19:36-0:19:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:36):**  and buy it.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:38):**  So it was more about, okay, how do we, how do we think this through?  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:42):**  And actually what came to mind, it was a bit of a brainstorm.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:45):**  Had a really great group of people that helped me with the design work, like the packaging  
**[0:19:50-0:19:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:50):**  side.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:51):**  And I was thinking, let's let the Kickstarter concept versus the existing CSAs or community  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:58):**  supported agriculture, like the concepts there, what we're doing is not really new.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:02):**  It's kind of just a variation on, on other things.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:06):**  And they're like, look, what about a gym membership sort of subscription size?  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:09):**  And I was like, you know what, we let's have a crack at it.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:12):**  And that's kind of how it came apart, sort of around.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:16):**  So that's where the model came from.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:18):**  When you first launched it, were you nervous?  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:21):**  Like we work with a lot of farmers in our farmers to founders program.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:23):**  And one of the things we teach is a kind of concept of a pre-sale, like, you know, going  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:27):**  out there and saying, you know, this will exist, but it's, it's a pretty big shifted  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:31):**  mindset to say, you know, you're going to give me the money and I'm not going to give  
**[0:20:34-0:20:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:34):**  you the good right away.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:36):**  Was that hard for you to kind of initially launch it or how did that happen?  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:40):**  I think so.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:41):**  So we tested it out.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:42):**  So we knew that people wanted the eggs and that was from, so the first six months was  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:47):**  actually selling straight wholesale, so straight into cafes to make brunch for people on a  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:51):**  Saturday morning.

**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:57):**  empire.  
**[0:20:58-0:20:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:58):**  It's just me really.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:59):**  So, the Royal we.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:00):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:01):**  When I was first starting off, just to make sure that people wanted an egg, a different  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:08):**  type of egg, I was like, how is our product going to be different?  
**[0:21:12-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:12):**  And those conversations with chefs were really, really interesting.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:15):**  The biggest problems they were having with eggs at the time were related to freshness.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:21):**  They when people put, and I didn't know a lot about eggs.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:24):**  I wasn't someone that was poaching eggs every weekend for breakfast.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:28):**  So didn't know this and learned a lot very quickly.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:31):**  Chefs when they go to poach an egg, the egg needs to be super fresh.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:34):**  Otherwise it just, the water they sort of crack it into it, just the egg goes everywhere  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:38):**  and it's not only a waste of their time, but it's a waste of the cost of the egg itself.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:42):**  So if we could guarantee, which we do, that these eggs were going to be less than 48 hours  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:47):**  old when we delivered them to them, that seemed to be something that they were pretty keen  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:53):**  on.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:54):**  So that was our first six months.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:56):**  So we knew that the product was good.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:59):**  We knew that the animal welfare side, we hoped, I mean, these chickens were getting treated  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:02):**  better than I was in summer.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:04):**  So I hope that the welfare side was up to scratch.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:08):**  But you're right about the nervousness for the subscription because this is what it was.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:12):**  I almost felt like a big pilot.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:14):**  So we took a group and piloted the program for about three months going, is this weird?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:19):**  Like are people willing to not only pay in advance, but it's not just that.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:23):**  They're getting their eggs from one of, like from a hub somewhere in Newcastle in the Hunter.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:31):**  They're not going to the supermarket to get it.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:32):**  They're not exchanging cash for this.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:34):**  It's a very different feeling.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:36):**  And so we had quite a few learnings from that.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:40):**  But what we realized very quickly is that we didn't really want to change people's existing  
**[0:22:46-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:46):**  behavior too much straight away.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:48):**  So if they were already going in for a coffee, we wanted them to be able to pick up their  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:53):**  eggs at the same time.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:54):**  So we partnered with hubs.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:57):**  We now have about 25, but the hubs are really popular cafes that have regular customers.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:03):**  So they're already getting their morning coffee before they go to work or in this COVID environment,  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:07):**  they're getting their morning coffee because they want to get out of the house.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:11):**  In the early days, Sarah also had success finding customers through selling at local  
**[0:23:15-0:23:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:15):**  farmers markets.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:16):**  However, she quickly realized that while these customers were loyal, it wasn't the channel  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:22):**  that would enable her business to scale.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:25):**  Everyone was so supportive and we would sell out every Sunday.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:29):**  But at the same time, they weren't necessarily going to be the same customers that would  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:34):**  be subscribers because people going to the farmer's market were...  
**[0:23:39-0:23:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:39):**  That was their routine.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:40):**  That's like an outing.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:41):**  It's an activity.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:42):**  So then suggesting that they actually pick up these eggs from somewhere else, that wasn't  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:45):**  really going to happen.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:47):**  I think to that original question is, were they going to the cafe or were they coming  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:51):**  for us or did they know us?  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:54):**  I think it was a combination because the cafes that we partnered with, Newcastle just seems  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:58):**  to be this amazing community that really supports, I don't know, new ideas and trying things.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:03):**  It's a great market for testing ideas out.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:06):**  So the cafes were super keen on supporting local and when they could put a face to the  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:11):**  brand as well, that was helpful.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:12):**  So social media played a part there in increasing awareness.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:16):**  But I think also we got a little bit of traction social media wise.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:21):**  People would ask us and we would ask them, where would you like the next hub to be?  
**[0:24:26-0:24:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:26):**  And that sort of style.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:27):**  And look, not all the hubs have worked out.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:30):**  And we've learned a lot about that sort of process as well.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:33):**  So yeah, I think it's a combination about knowing the brand and knowing the hubs themselves.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:38):**  That theme of constant improvement and lean is coming through again, like just all the  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:41):**  testing and trialing of different things that you're doing.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:44):**  Was that really intentional?  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:45):**  Were you designing and running experiments or more just something that kind of came through  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:49):**  from your time in other industries?  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:53):**  I think, I mean, there's always the models and lean and sort of round the plan, do check  
**[0:24:58-0:25:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:58):**  act, come back again, like that cycle of improvement.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:01):**  I think for farmers in general too, that is just, that's just how you operate.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:06):**  So to your point, I don't think there were formal experiments, not like I would have  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:10):**  said done in the banking world or mining world because you're trying to bring people along.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:15):**  I mean, it's the luxury also of having a very, very, very small team.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:19):**  So you can be quite agile from that perspective.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:23):**  So I think, yes, that was absolutely intentional to be like, let's test something with, we  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:28):**  have no fear of it not working.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:31):**  I don't think it was potentially going to impact the brand.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:33):**  The only thing that we've seen on the downside of testing something is when a hub doesn't  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:38):**  work out, you've usually got, you could have 10 or 15 people that are like severely disappointed  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:43):**  that they now can't collect their eggs from that hub and managing that.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:48):**  You're having a conversation with every one of these people because they feel like it's  
**[0:25:51-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:51):**  a two way street.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:52):**  They feel like, and they are supporting you and have bought into this and they're emotionally

**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:58):**  And now you feel like you're seriously disappointing them.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:00):**  So often those people will then travel to a different hub to collect their eggs.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:05):**  It's quite, it's really lovely, the support, but you do feel like you've let a few people  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:10):**  down along the way too.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:12):**  You can certainly hear just how much Sarah's customers mean to her.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:15):**  And it's an interesting perspective because such a strong customer focus is actually quite  
**[0:26:20-0:26:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:20):**  unique in agriculture.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:22):**  It means she needs to be across every aspect of the customer experience from attracting  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:27):**  and retaining subscribers to their enjoyment of the end product.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:32):**  Her background in business has helped, but she says she needed to outsource some of the  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:37):**  other skills required.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:39):**  There's quite a range of skills required and I certainly don't have all of those skills.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:43):**  I have contracted out, so the creative side being the design of our packaging and the  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:50):**  website, even the design that goes on our delivery van, all that sort of stuff.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:55):**  I've worked with a great company called Head Jam here in Newcastle who are fabulous and  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:27:00):**  have gone beyond being just, not to say just the design, but just the creative.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:27:05):**  They really helped me balance ideas around how this business might work.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:27:10):**  And to be honest, they're way more trendy than me, so they're probably, they've got  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:27:15):**  more of a feel for what's going on in Newcastle.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:27:17):**  So I got a good feel as to what might work, might not as just one sort of tool of information.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:27:23):**  I am lucky also though that I have been able to draw on some skills from prior learning  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:27:31):**  so that the lean side has definitely come into play along the way, especially the continuous  
**[0:27:36-0:27:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:27:36):**  improvement and really trying to dig deep into who is our actual customer.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:27:42):**  But that probably takes us to that next point around, I don't know if you have a commodity  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:27:47):**  based business, there's certainly some of the learnings that we've, sorry, some of the  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:27:51):**  things we've done here that would apply to the commodity side.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:27:54):**  But I also have the luxury of being in a community like Newcastle itself where I can go and speak  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:01):**  to my actual customer, the end customer, I mean, like the end person who's consuming  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:05):**  this product.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:06):**  And really, I think that was where some of that, the Nuffield research that I undertook,  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:12):**  which really looked at what are the emotional motivators for these customers?  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:17):**  And more importantly, I could guess what they are or make some assumptions, but how do I  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:21):**  actually go and find out?  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:23):**  And that was more about going and sitting with our customers when they're using the  
**[0:28:26-0:28:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:26):**  eggs and really asking them some questions rather than me just sort of making an assumption  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:32):**  or sort of incremental improvements on what we were doing.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:36):**  Yeah, again, that's such a parallel to the startup world.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:38):**  I mean, literally, that's what we coach startups to do.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:41):**  And the companies that we end up investing in have really nailed that customer value  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:46):**  proposition as it's called and the business model that delivers it really well.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:51):**  And you've exactly hit on it.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:53):**  You know, farmers are really good at continuous improvement and that lean iterative approach.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:57):**  But sometimes on the customer side, either that's not possible or just hasn't been thought  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:02):**  of to go that far and really understand the end consumer.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:05):**  Tell me a little bit more about what other examples have you seen of farmers doing this  
**[0:29:09-0:29:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:09):**  kind of thing globally?  
**[0:29:11-0:29:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:11):**  Yeah, Nuffield was an amazing experience with the intent of being given the scholarship  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:18):**  to go and find best practice learnings across the world and bring that back and share that.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:22):**  So for me, my topic was around, well, farming businesses with a passion for excellence.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:30):**  And yeah, so you're right, the opportunity to visit these farms that were just, they  
**[0:29:35-0:29:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:35):**  just are obsessed with their customers.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:38):**  And some of them are big, like, and sort of just like, okay, what are you doing?  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:42):**  Like actually having this conversation.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:43):**  So you're able to sort of stand there, watch what they're doing.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:46):**  But once you're watching their operation, actually make a phone call back and be like,  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:50):**  okay, I really want to talk to you about why you or how you're doing this with your customers.  
**[0:29:53-0:30:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:53):**  And some of the examples, I think of two or three, one would be a strawberry farmer in  
**[0:30:00-0:30:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:00):**  the Netherlands.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:02):**  He was really interesting because he knew that certain things like convenience, customer  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:09):**  service or I don't know, quality, reliability, all those things are great sort of attributes  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:13):**  to have in a product.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:14):**  But he knew that he had to have an amazing strawberry product itself.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:19):**  And what he then chose, like, I want to focus on one other thing.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:22):**  And for him it was flexibility, which engendered an extraordinary amount of loyalty from his  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:27):**  wholesale customers.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:28):**  So to give you an example, and I'll sort of put them into two baskets.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:32):**  He had the Japanese market, so he was exporting to Japan and he was also exporting to other  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:37):**  parts of Europe.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:38):**  But they're two really, really different customers.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:41):**  He was able to figure out that the Japanese were so particular about their strawberries  
**[0:30:47-0:30:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:47):**  that he could get from them the exact size of the strawberries they want.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:50):**  For example, between 13 to 15 grams per strawberry.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:54):**  When positioned in the punnet, the strawberries had to be all facing the same way, all on  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:57):**  bubble wrap, all of the same color or a certain color against a color chart.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:03):**  And then for an additional premium, he was able to get the thicknesses just through,  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:07):**  I want to say closeness, not geographical closeness, but the intimacy piece through  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:11):**  discussions with the end customer.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:14):**  He was able to find out that I'm not sure if you've ever noticed, but when you've got  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:17):**  a punnet of strawberries, the sort of the dead leaves, those little brown leaves that  
**[0:31:21-0:31:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:21):**  might be in the bottom of the punnet itself.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:23):**  So he was able to find out that the Japanese would pay more for this product if he could  
**[0:31:28-0:31:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:28):**  get rid of those brown leaves out of the punnet itself.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:31):**  And so he came up, as farmers do, they were like, yeah, no worries, I can sort this out.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:37):**  Came out with a really simple solution of the conveyor and compressed air to just to

**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:46):**  But in addition to that, he's like, okay, not all my strawberries are going to be 13  
**[0:31:50-0:31:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:50):**  to 15 grams of a particular color, et cetera.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:53):**  What am I going to do with the rest of them?  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:54):**  And he'd already had the European market and where he was looking there, I mean, where

**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:01):**  So not food waste, but waste being defects or rework or transportation, like rehandling  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:07):**  your product, like double handling sort of thing.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:09):**  He was like, the Europeans were quite happy to have strawberries that weren't on those  
**[0:32:14-0:32:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:14):**  bubble wrap punnets all facing the same way.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:17):**  They actually quite liked them.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:19):**  As long as they were of a certain quality, they met a certain low quality standard, they  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:23):**  were happy for those strawberries to be picked straight off the vine, put into a cardboard  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:27):**  punnet into a larger box.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:30):**  But those cardboard punnets were going straight to the market.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:33):**  So there was no double handling.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:34):**  They were coming straight off the vine into what would be the end packaging for the consumer.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:39):**  And they were absolutely meeting a quality standard.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:41):**  And yeah, you had no rework and no double handling.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:45):**  And he hasn't necessarily gone through some lean Six Sigma formal process.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:51):**  That's just him knowing that if I get this right with the customer and the more precise  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:56):**  I can be with my customer, how much more value that creates for them.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:01):**  I love that story.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:02):**  I also love your use of rework.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:04):**  I'm also a big nerd and like systems and processes and like continuous improvement diagrams.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:10):**  So I don't usually get to talk about rework, but we could nerd out on that.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:15):**  I hate it.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:16):**  Like I literally start twitching when we see it here.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:20):**  Just rework and double handling is a big thing, but just watching someone when we know how  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:25):**  something's supposed to be done and then we're like, Hey, hang on.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:28):**  That didn't happen that way.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:29):**  I'm sure everyone's the same.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:30):**  Well, I'm not sure actually.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:31):**  Like I think there's a lot of in any business, not just in farming or agriculture, there's  
**[0:33:35-0:33:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:35):**  a lot of, well, we've always done it this way.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:37):**  And it's, it is hard, like both emotionally, mentally, and actually just time and cost-wise  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:41):**  to challenge how you've done things and think about doing them differently.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:44):**  So I think that's pretty unique to be always seeking out that improvement, even though  
**[0:33:48-0:33:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:48):**  it, you know, we all, all want to improve, but doing the hard work to actually improve  
**[0:33:52-0:33:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:52):**  is not as easy.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:53):**  I'll give you actually an example of that.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:57):**  Like for me, what those sort of things shine through is if we can attach a dollar value  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:00):**  to it and it might, it was a bit like the ground eggs, like an egg being laid on the  
**[0:34:04-0:34:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:04):**  ground, how much lost revenue.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:05):**  And when you can describe that to the rest of the team, everyone's like, oh crap, wow.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:09):**  But there was a nursery, a tomato nursery in Japan that we visited.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:14):**  And I mean, the Japanese obviously are renowned for continuous improvement.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:18):**  I mean, that's where sort of the Toyota continuous improvement system came from.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:22):**  But I just like this really basic example and I'm sure people can relate to it once  
**[0:34:26-0:34:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:26):**  sort of they think about it.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:29):**  They would have their employees turn up for work.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:31):**  And if we just looked at the basic tools, they were using just a pair of secateurs to  
**[0:34:35-0:34:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:35):**  harvest the tomatoes.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:37):**  What they were finding just from watching people work, this was a startup that had gone,  
**[0:34:42-0:34:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:42):**  that had scaled really quickly.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:43):**  So this was sort of early on in the scaling days.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:47):**  People were really searching to find the tools and just to put a basic timer on that, if  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:53):**  someone spent sort of 10 minutes searching for a pair of secateurs every morning times  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:57):**  that by the number of employees, it worked out just per employee that it would equate  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:02):**  to about 60 hours in a year just looking for a pair of secateurs, which I don't know, 25  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:08):**  bucks an hour, what's that, 1500 bucks or something in a year just looking for a tool.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:12):**  So the basic, it's the same with anyone though.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:15):**  You could be looking for a spanner to do some repairs on your tractor or whatever it might.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:18):**  I mean, we still do it here.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:20):**  So the behavior being like the shadow board creation, which a lot of workshops would have  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:25):**  now.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:26):**  So now this is where your tool is, let's just go straight here, et cetera.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:29):**  But it was like, actually it was a really nice little basic example of some numbers  
**[0:35:34-0:35:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:34):**  attached to it and going, Oh my God, this is almost embarrassing.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:38):**  I guess that's kind of where I wanted to go next, Sarah, is like, what changes do you,  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:44):**  have you guys applied if any to the beef operation or like what lessons would you have or insights  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:49):**  for maybe more commodity producers who aren't thinking as much about innovating the business  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:54):**  model, but are there opportunities to embody these lessons of continuous improvement and  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:59):**  customer intimacy in even those more traditional businesses?  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:04):**  So for our beef business, and I've only just taken over the beef business probably in the  
**[0:36:09-0:36:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:09):**  last 12 months because my father was running out and he passed away last year.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:12):**  So we, I think for me, it's now, okay, what, had to ask the question, what do we want to  
**[0:36:18-0:36:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:18):**  do with the beef business?  
**[0:36:19-0:36:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:19):**  How do we want to run it?  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:21):**  And we will look to shift it, I think I'm saying this and it's one of those ones where  
**[0:36:26-0:36:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:26):**  you say it out loud, then hopefully it happens.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:28):**  We'll shift it to more consumer, consumer facing, not all of that business, so maybe  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:33):**  sort of 20% of it, but the commodity business still, we can still apply a lot of aspects  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:38):**  of lean and we have been doing that over the years.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:41):**  And that's, that wasn't as basic as going and look at, go and see sort of one basic  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:46):**  term, go and have a look at other operations that are doing things well and see what you

**[0:36:51-0:36:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:51):**  Another big piece was the standardization.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:53):**  So whilst everyone goes off at their animals, you can't create stand like sort of stuff  
**[0:36:59-0:37:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:59):**  if something, you know, and it's something inevitably happens and I'm like, well, yes,  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:03):**  but we've learned even with the chickens that we can predict to a certain degree how long  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:09):**  an improvement will take or if we put a little bit of the labor in here, it will change their  
**[0:37:14-0:37:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:14):**  behavior and their routine.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:16):**  So I think for us, it's been about standardizing what we do and simplifying.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:23):**  We also would probably look a little bit at, I mean, I was calling it production control.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:28):**  I don't know.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:29):**  That's just probably from the mining days of producing the amount, the exact amount  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:34):**  of rather than producing as much as possible, I think is probably something we need to think  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:40):**  about.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:41):**  So that was the same with the chickens.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:42):**  So with the chooks, we knew we were chasing a sort of a margin business there.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:47):**  So we don't need to scale.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:48):**  We're not chasing another 10,000 birds.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:51):**  For me, it's more about how to create more customer value with the product we have from  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:57):**  that perspective.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:58):**  I think it is a little bit harder for the commodity business.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:00):**  I think the lean application is absolutely doable.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:03):**  That's a no brainer and that's just looking at removing waste from the process itself.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:09):**  My thing that we have done with the beef too is looked at a value stream map.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:14):**  And I mean, basically for me, that's just plotting out, sitting down with the team,  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:19):**  like anyone in your team to do with the cattle business, plotting out what we do with the  
**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:23):**  product from start to finish, from when they're carving or getting ready to carve all the  
**[0:38:27-0:38:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:27):**  way through to the sale of the villa or whatever it might be and go, okay, then think about  
**[0:38:33-0:38:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:33):**  waste.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:34):**  And I think that's where people sort of trying to get their head around what is actually  
**[0:38:36-0:38:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:36):**  waste.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:37):**  And there's some really good books and information out there on defining that.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:41):**  There's a great book called The Lean Farm by Ben Hartman that actually looks at the  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:45):**  practicalities day to day of that from a horticultural context.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:49):**  But for me, it's like, how do we remove the rework?  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:52):**  How do we remove doing more than we need to?  
**[0:38:55-0:39:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:55):**  That's something that we have to learn for the chickens because no matter what, we're  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:01):**  always going to look after the chickens really, really well.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:04):**  But we have to put that filter over it going, okay, what are the customers also willing  
**[0:39:08-0:39:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:08):**  to pay for from that perspective?  
**[0:39:10-0:39:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:10):**  So yeah, I think there are learnings for the commodity business, but I think it's more  
**[0:39:14-0:39:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:14):**  on the lean side and standardization of processes, removing unplanned maintenance, removing rework.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:21):**  So machinery, mechanically things failing, et cetera.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:24):**  You're like, okay, dig to the root cause.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:27):**  And that I think that's natural for a lot of farmers to look for what is the root cause  
**[0:39:30-0:39:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:30):**  here rather than just the bandaid solution.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:32):**  But that's just something that's built into what we do now.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:35):**  Sarah, there's so many parallels here with startups.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:39):**  And I guess that's been one of the insights of this conversation for me is how much applies  
**[0:39:42-0:39:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:42):**  from other industries.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:44):**  One of the big things we talk about with startups is doing non-scalable things to figure out  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:48):**  what scales and the perch example like Owen, and if you have to do it every day manually,  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:54):**  but if over time you don't and that has a big improvement, that's worth doing that non-scalable  
**[0:39:58-0:39:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:58):**  task.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:59):**  And I think there's lots of examples of that approach and it's exactly the same in the  
**[0:40:02-0:40:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:02):**  tech and startup world.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:05):**  It's really interesting talking to you about that because I've not really thought about  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:07):**  it from the parallels to the startup perspective, but it's exactly what I suppose it is.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:12):**  It is also a startup business.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:14):**  And I think you do get asked the question, would you franchise or would you scale it?  
**[0:40:17-0:40:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:17):**  And I think for me, the bit I'm enjoying has been, okay, how do we perfect this?  
**[0:40:22-0:40:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:22):**  What could be seen actually as a pilot for something else, but at the same time, I'm  
**[0:40:28-0:40:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:28):**  quite happy with the size we're at and we will probably look to diversify or our product  
**[0:40:33-0:40:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:33):**  range here on the farm to utilize this fixed asset more effectively or even add value added  
**[0:40:39-0:40:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:39):**  products to our current line as opposed to how do we go and replicate this somewhere  
**[0:40:45-0:40:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:45):**  else.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:46):**  I think also I'm a mild control freak.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:49):**  So I think the customer piece for me, if I was looking at what's scalable, I'd really  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:55):**  have to get my head around and I'm sure a lot of people have to think this too.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:00):**  How do you scale the customer intimacy piece?  
**[0:41:04-0:41:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:04):**  It's actually the question we're asking at the moment.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:07):**  How do we scale this customer intimacy piece?  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:10):**  It has a really authentic, genuine feel to it.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:14):**  Social media can only do so much.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:16):**  I'm sure there's a tech piece there.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:18):**  I'm just not tech savvy enough to have the answer to that, but there's something that's  
**[0:41:23-0:41:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:23):**  probably the biggest question for us at the moment.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:26):**  I really look forward to hearing and watching how you answer that.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:30):**  Last question from me, Sarah, how did you come up with the name?  
**[0:41:36-0:41:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:36):**  So when I looked it up, I totally thought Just Been Laid would have been used by someone  
**[0:41:42-0:41:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:42):**  else.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:43):**  I was like, there's no way.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:44):**  But when I typed it into the business register, I was like, oh my gosh, really?  
**[0:41:48-0:41:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:48):**  Okay.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:49):**  And it's a hundred percent to do with the freshness of the eggs.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:53):**  That's our competitive advantage or the piece that differentiates us.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:56):**  So it seemed quite fitting.

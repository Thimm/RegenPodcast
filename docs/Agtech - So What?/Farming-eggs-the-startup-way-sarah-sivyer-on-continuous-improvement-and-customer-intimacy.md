### Agtech - So What?  (2020-11-18)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast, brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  In this episode, we asked, how do you like your eggs?  
**[0:00:13-0:00:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:13):**  I like mine fried and runny, but everyone has their own personal preference.  And that's kind of the point.  It's precisely this kind of customer focus that Sarah Sivir, today's guest, is passionate  
**[0:00:25-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:25):**  about.  Sarah is an egg and livestock producer, and she started her business, which is called  Just Been Laid, completely from scratch.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:34):**  It was only going to be 450 birds to start with.  And so they arrived and I sort of got the shock of my life only because the day they  arrived, it was a 47 degree day, sort of middle of January.  
**[0:00:48-0:01:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:00:48):**  And I was just like, oh my gosh, these birds are literally all going to die the first day  they get here.  Sarah may have been new to eggs at the time, but she was not new to business or to farming,  
**[0:01:00-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:00):**  having grown up on a farm before entering the corporate world.  With her venture into eggs, she's using her insights and best practices from the corporate  world, including staying laser focused on what her customers want.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:12):**  In the case of eggs, that's convenience and confidence that their eggs are being produced  sustainably and ethically.  This has led to a very non-traditional business model for agriculture, at least.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:25):**  A direct to consumer subscription service where people buy the eggs even before they're  laid.  Even if you don't like eggs at all, Sarah has some powerful insights about continuous  
**[0:01:35-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:35):**  improvement and the similarities between startups and farms.  She's a woman who is not afraid to get up close and personal with her chooks or her  customers.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:44):**  I run a pasture raised egg subscription business up here in the Hunter Valley in New South  Wales.  We have about two and a half thousand birds, give or take 500, depending on what part of  
**[0:01:58-0:02:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:01:58):**  the season we're in.  But the important part of that, I suppose, is the subscription model where we work with  customers to get paid in advance for the product, a bit like a gym membership or something like  
**[0:02:10-0:02:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:10):**  that.  So we run two and a half thousand birds along with about two or 300 head of cattle on a  couple of thousand acres here in the Hunter.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:19):**  That is awesome.  Now, have you always been involved in the egg industry?  No.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:24):**  So my career started at university.  I studied chemical engineering and commerce, which I absolutely loved.  But that just came from a really keen interest in chemistry and maths at school.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:37):**  So there wasn't much else to that decision.  Then after a few years at UD there, I actually headed off and worked for the likes of BHP  Billiton on mining sites.  
**[0:02:46-0:03:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:02:46):**  And the main thing there is it's probably where I got my love for data, became a bit  of a nerd around data as I studied to be a lean Six Sigma black belt.  If you're wondering whether Sarah is a ninja, then no, not quite.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:02):**  That's just how business nerds, myself very much included, describe their level of knowledge  in a process improvement framework called Six Sigma.  This approach is all about driving continuous improvement largely through reducing variation  
**[0:03:15-0:03:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:15):**  and eliminating waste.  While Six Sigma started in the automotive industry and Sarah learned about it in mining,  she has been applying it to ag.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:25):**  The Six Sigma side really focuses hard on data and looks at variation.  So the chemical engineering side was just an absolute fabulous step into the data world.  After BHP, did a little bit more study, went and did my MBA over at the University of Oxford,  
**[0:03:41-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:41):**  which helped me transition into where I really feel quite comfortable in the world of agriculture.  And yeah, from then on spent the next probably eight, 10 years in corporate agri.  Right.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:03:54):**  So you're sitting at Oxford and you had a passion for agriculture or were interested  in it?  What was the connection there?  
**[0:04:01-0:04:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:01):**  So I come from a fifth generation family farm.  So having grown up on the farm, I always had, I don't know, everyone just says you've got  in your blood or something like that.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:08):**  I think for me it was like, I always knew I wanted to come back.  It's really hard to articulate sort of that feeling.  But so for me it was like, okay, how do I make this transition to still be in the corporate  
**[0:04:21-0:04:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:21):**  world for a little while?  I wasn't ready to come home straight away.  And there was actually this course during my MBA called Managing Information in the  
**[0:04:29-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:29):**  Bioeconomy and that just really did some really interesting case studies on global agribusiness.  And from that I went and worked for Syngenta over in Switzerland who basically at that  point they were kicking off a team called their food security team.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:45):**  This was about 2010 I think.  And my boss there was covered up a crush money who went on after Syngenta to then head up  the WWF.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:04:55):**  She was the global conservation director.  So for her, her passion came straight down to let's look at smallholder farmers or the  businesses.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:04):**  Syngenta really wanted a strong focus on pre-commercial smallholder farmers.  So that's like farmers with less than two hectares or less than the size of two footy  fields worth of land.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:14):**  And how can we help these guys?  Where are their constraints?  And for us that was just absolutely so interesting.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:21):**  It was looking at access to markets, access to finance, info, training, all of those sort  of things.  So it helped, I only spent a short amount of time there before returning to Australia,  
**[0:05:30-0:05:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:30):**  but it was really about how do we look to create business models that can work with  these farmers.  Do you have any examples of things that were successful there?  
**[0:05:39-0:05:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:39):**  Absolutely.  So for me, whilst I was there early on in the days, like when these projects actually  came to fruition, I think some of the success stories could have been even around production.  
**[0:05:49-0:06:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:05:49):**  So production, you're looking at really simple, basic greenhouses, which helped to increase  tomato yields by 400%.  And that might sound crazy, but if you've now got protection from the weather or climate,  
**[0:06:00-0:06:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:00):**  you can control your climate better.  That is an extraordinary jump and such a simple solution.  But the next problem these farmers had was how do we actually get our product to market?  
**[0:06:11-0:06:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:11):**  So the next problem to solve was more around, do we pick the product earlier, like harvest  the tomato earlier so it perishes less, getting it to market, et cetera.  Things like that were discussions around training, production methods.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:23):**  Other business models were around bartering.  Others include micro insurance.  They're just really simple, accessible solutions based on the things that everyone has.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:34):**  So for example, everyone has a mobile phone or had a mobile phone in that.  So creating communication and access to information through those sort of channels, it was really  quite powerful and something that I just learned a lot from.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:47):**  It was nice to be a part of.  That's really interesting.  And I guess kind of actually is maybe the earlier parts of the continuous improvement  
**[0:06:55-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:06:55):**  journey for you.  It sounds like some of those farms were going on a pretty different, but still a continuous  improvement journey with looking at those different business models.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:03):**  Oh, 100%.  And I think we learned, once we picked up the training, like for me, that Lean Six Sigma  work, it was lucky enough to pick it up with BHP, but it's just been literally applicable  
**[0:07:13-0:07:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:13):**  in every job we've had so far after that.  There's such a strong focus on both data and people.  So being able to combine that where possible has been really, really powerful.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:24):**  And to your point, yeah, the farmers that we were working with, everyone just has this,  I mean, things just farming in general, like farmers just have this appetite to continuously  improve, learn about new production methods, learn how to increase yields, learn how to  
**[0:07:38-0:07:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:38):**  better deal with the environment that they are in.  And yeah, anything we could do there to increase that access to information was really powerful.  So you were in Switzerland working for Syngenta, but then how did you end up back on the farm  
**[0:07:51-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:07:51):**  with your two and a half thousand birds?  So it was a bit of a random jump.  So my father got a little bit unwell.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:00):**  So I left Switzerland a little earlier than I had planned to, but that was absolutely  fine.  I came back to Oz, I actually came back to the farm to start with, just sort of to help  
**[0:08:09-0:08:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:09):**  out here for a little bit, then ended up working for the International Finance, or IFC, International  Finance Corporation as part of the World Bank.  Then very similar, sort of smallholder farmer work, very similar to what I've been doing  
**[0:08:20-0:08:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:20):**  with Syngenta.  But that allowed me to be back in Australia and working sort of part-time on the farm.  And then shifted to Rabobank.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:29):**  I never thought I would work for a bank.  I think when I left chemical engineering, like 50% of my class ended up working in fire  dance and I thought, no, that's not going to be me.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:37):**  And then I ended up working in a bank and it's seriously one of the best jobs I had.  I was part of the Food and Agri research team looking after animal proteins research.  So you could be traveling around, like I probably spent, I don't know, 20 weeks, it could be  
**[0:08:55-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:08:55):**  over the course of the year, out with farmers in central Queensland, New South Wales, Northern  Territory, all over the country, talking about international beef markets and global trends  really.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:08):**  And it's just, it's so interesting.  I felt like a complete newbie novice because you're talking to farmers that have been doing  this for 50 years and their knowledge is just extraordinary.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:18):**  So it was a bit of a two way street with information sharing.  So I learned a lot from them.  And then yeah, after Rabobank, I think that's when you started to get that itch going, hey,  
**[0:09:26-0:09:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:26):**  I think it's time to go back to the farm.  Left Rabobank, spent about six months doing a heap of due diligence into what I might  do back here.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:36):**  Yeah, it came down to something that needed to be complimentary to the beef business.  We didn't really want to compromise on the beef, but equally I wanted something of my  own sort of almost just to be able to start from scratch, test out and apply a lot of  
**[0:09:52-0:10:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:09:52):**  the learnings from the last 10 or 15 years and see what we could do.  And yeah, it turned out to be eggs.  And how did that happen?  
**[0:10:02-0:10:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:02):**  Did you guys have hens before?  Like what was the reason for eggs?  Yeah, I really don't have a good answer for this.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:11):**  I need a better answer.  It definitely didn't grow up with chickens, learn everything from scratch.  Being like research nerd, like it was almost like analysis paralysis.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:23):**  Like, you know, you're sort of doing so much work going, okay, we've got to get this right,  et cetera.  And then it just came down to let's just flick the switch.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:29):**  I feel like we're pretty well prepared for this to the point where we were going to have,  it was only going to be 450 birds to start with.  And so they arrived and I sort of got the shock of my life only because the day they  
**[0:10:43-0:10:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:43):**  arrived, it was a 47 degree day, sort of middle of January.  And I was just like, Oh my gosh, these birds are literally all going to die the first day  they get here.  
**[0:10:53-0:11:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:10:53):**  But it was literally like that.  No, what happened was you sort of go so out of your way.  So we were feeding them, feeding the frozen veggies, iced water.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:03):**  I slept in a swag down with the chickens because they're in, I've got to describe this, they're  in mobile caravans.  So the mobile caravans parked basically in a rainforest at this point, which whilst it  
**[0:11:15-0:11:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:15):**  was 47 degrees out on sort of the main ridge country, it was sort of well down into the  sort of low thirties where the chickens were.  So the stresses of setting things up kind of paid off, but there certainly were a few  
**[0:11:27-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:27):**  sleepless nights in a swag just checking on chickens every 20 minutes.  Oh my gosh.  And they also were getting used to the frozen veggie diet and then we're about to hit reality.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:36):**  Yeah, absolutely.  They went straight out.  It's really interesting the routine.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:42):**  So we were really, really hands on with the chooks, which obviously lifts our cost of  production.  So the hands on approach is like literally when the chickens arrive, they've come from  
**[0:11:54-0:12:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:11:54):**  a barn, they're about 15, 16 weeks old and we spend the first four nights, only an hour  each night, but there'll be three or four of us that will pick up every bird and put  it on a perch because the birds will naturally be inclined to sort of huddle together for  
**[0:12:10-0:12:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:10):**  security and warmth.  So we just, it's like going to a gym class and doing 400 squats in 45 minutes and literally  just picking up every bird off the ground, putting it on the perch.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:23):**  And it's amazing.  It's like humans, like every other animal, everyone gets into a routine.  So night two, probably 50% of those birds realize that bed is in the caravan on that  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:34):**  perch.  So they'll go in by themselves.  We'll pick up the other 50% probably only take half an hour or so.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:40):**  Then night three, you'll still have 30 or 40 birds.  And by night four, look, you've got a couple of stragglers, but they eventually cotton  on to how things are supposed to go.  
**[0:12:48-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:12:48):**  So after that, the birds, a hundred percent, no matter where we move the caravan, so we'll  move the caravan really frequently just to spread manure, et cetera.  The birds will follow and yeah, put themselves to bed at night, which is quite handy.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:04):**  And now is the bird operation integrated with the beef operation at all?  Like when you're saying you're moving them, is that part of a whole system or are they  pretty separate operations?  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:12):**  A hundred percent.  That's a really good question.  Yes, they're completely integrated.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:17):**  We try to run the cattle sort of before and after.  We certainly give the soil or pasture a certain amount of rest, but initially we use the cattle  almost like a lawnmower to keep the grass or pasture short enough for the chickens.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:31):**  If you have certainly long pasture, you find that the chickens themselves get sort of sour  crop.  They just, the grass sort of ferments in their crop and that's dangerous if not sort of lethal  
**[0:13:40-0:13:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:40):**  for the chooks.  So the cattle move across.  We follow the chickens behind and depending on what season as to how quickly the grass  
**[0:13:47-0:14:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:13:47):**  grows again as to when you might bring the cattle back.  But we don't really bring the chooks back for five, six months, sort of minimum.  More to let the chicken, what the work that the chickens have done.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:00):**  So sort of spreading the cow manure, spreading their own manure, scratching, basically conditioning  the soil.  Let that happen.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:06):**  And it's really exciting.  I just, sorry, it sounds like a bit of a nerd here now getting excited over this, but anyway,  after that, it's been sort of three or four years or three and a half years now.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:17):**  And being able to look at these pastures from above and now that we've actually had some  rain, it's been some pretty dry summers or dry times recently.  You just can see this, what will be the long term benefits because it's really obvious,  
**[0:14:33-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:33):**  like very, very obvious sort of dark green, yellow where the chickens, like the boundaries  between where the chickens have been and haven't been.  And I think that combined with us trying to increase our diversity in the pasture species  
**[0:14:45-0:14:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:45):**  is that look, it's a long term game, but really trying hard to integrate it and still learning.  Yeah.  You mentioned costs before and like that's all your workers out there doing their squats  
**[0:14:55-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:14:55):**  is probably not cheap and moving them and just there's a lot there that's quite different.  How originally was the business model different to support that or how do you kind of think  about making the economics work?  
**[0:15:09-0:15:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:09):**  Yeah, so definitely look at cost of production per dozen eggs.  Labor is significant.  If I looked at a dozen eggs, I'm actually just doing this off the top of my head, I'd  
**[0:15:22-0:15:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:22):**  say three or four of those eggs in the dozen would be worth in the labor, it's cost of  production side.  Another three or four, about three in feed costs because we use a relatively, well, it's  
**[0:15:32-0:15:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:32):**  not going to say expensive, but it's more costly than other feeds because it's vegetarian.  And then another two or three of those eggs out of the 12 would equate to the cost of  the birds themselves and then the rest of those just other expenses.  
**[0:15:47-0:16:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:15:47):**  So yeah, labor is certainly a chunk, like probably a third of our cost of production.  But I think the people that buy our eggs, they're buying our eggs for a reason.  These eggs don't suit everyone, the cost of them, we sell them for $12 a dozen and that  
**[0:16:04-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:16:04):**  cost doesn't suit everyone.  I suppose if I looked in Woolworths or Coles at the moment, the average price of free range  eggs would be maybe $7 or something like that, just to give people perspective on that price.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:16:16):**  So yeah, the cost, we always knew it was going to be highly labor intensive.  I think we've learned what needs doing to save us money in the long run.  Like if I gave you an example, I was only thinking about this yesterday, we've got new  
**[0:16:29-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:16:29):**  birds at the moment and yes, we spent our three or four days perch training, but the  next step after that, five or six weeks after that, the chickens come onto the lay.  And again, hopefully most of them by that stage have found where the nest boxes are.  
**[0:16:45-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:16:45):**  So in these caravans whilst there's perches above the perches, there are nest boxes where  we really want the chickens to lay their eggs because then the eggs roll away off these  nest boxes onto a conveyor belt that we just wind in a few times a day to collect the eggs.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:00):**  So the important bit being there is you 100% want your chickens laying your eggs in the  nest boxes.  If we had a chicken laying an egg on the ground or in a tree, which we've had before, we can't  
**[0:17:14-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:14):**  use those eggs purely for food safety perspective.  That's where you'd be looking at things like salmonella and issues like that.  So we just 100% rule out using any egg that is laid, not in a nest box on the conveyor.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:26):**  So if you had a chicken that just from scratch decided to lay her egg up a tree every day  for, let's just round them some numbers, like 200 eggs and our eggs are literally could  be worth a dollar each.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:40):**  So while she only costs us $15 to buy, she's worth $200 in revenue and yeah, there you  go, lost straight away.  So if we only would have, after our work of finding those birds and training them, so  
**[0:17:53-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:17:53):**  we again would only spend sort of target probably about three days in a row an hour again going,  okay, they're all onto the lay and we've got 10 birds that are laying, not in the nest  boxes.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:03):**  Just stand there between probably eight, nine in the morning, it's peak hour.  You can watch them.  They go, they'll wander over to a tree and they'll be, you can look at it and you're  
**[0:18:12-0:18:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:12):**  like, oh my God, you're about to jump into that tree to lay an egg.  I would wander over, grab her, she'll squat for me anyway, and then I'll put her in the  nest box.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:22):**  I'll do that two days in a row.  And she's like, oh actually this nest box isn't so bad to lay an egg.  And for us, so per bird you're saving what, $200 a bird in lost revenue there, 10 of those,  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:33):**  2000.  So me spending four hours doing that is really a decent return.  Yep.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:40):**  That is, I've got a million questions on that.  That is hilarious.  I'm trying to get at the like, don't know, don't go up in the tree.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:47):**  Out of my head.  Hilarious.  We have conversations.  
**[0:18:52-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:18:52):**  That's too funny.  So I want to come back to the $12 a dozen retail.  That's definitely not for everyone, but, but you're right.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:00):**  I mean, obviously you're seeing there is demand for that.  Tell me a bit more about the business model.  And you mentioned the subscription people pay ahead of time.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:07):**  Was that the original model when you first bought the chooks?  Yeah.  So for me it was like, if we're going to do something new or in addition to the beef,  
**[0:19:16-0:19:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:16):**  it was really hoping to make the income stream as predictable as possible.  So I would get a little bit nervous about producing a product and then for me leaving  it on the shelf in a supermarket or at a store or something like that and hoping it's basically  
**[0:19:32-0:19:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:32):**  what it felt like that someone would like the packaging or like the idea of our eggs  and buy it.  So it was more about, okay, how do we, how do we think this through?  
**[0:19:42-0:19:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:42):**  And actually what came to mind, it was a bit of a brainstorm.  Had a really great group of people that helped me with the design work, like the packaging  side.  
**[0:19:51-0:20:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:19:51):**  And I was thinking, let's let the Kickstarter concept versus the existing CSAs or community  supported agriculture, like the concepts there, what we're doing is not really new.  It's kind of just a variation on, on other things.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:06):**  And they're like, look, what about a gym membership sort of subscription size?  And I was like, you know what, we let's have a crack at it.  And that's kind of how it came apart, sort of around.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:16):**  So that's where the model came from.  When you first launched it, were you nervous?  Like we work with a lot of farmers in our farmers to founders program.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:23):**  And one of the things we teach is a kind of concept of a pre-sale, like, you know, going  out there and saying, you know, this will exist, but it's, it's a pretty big shifted  mindset to say, you know, you're going to give me the money and I'm not going to give  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:34):**  you the good right away.  Was that hard for you to kind of initially launch it or how did that happen?  I think so.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:41):**  So we tested it out.  So we knew that people wanted the eggs and that was from, so the first six months was  actually selling straight wholesale, so straight into cafes to make brunch for people on a  
**[0:20:51-0:20:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:51):**  Saturday morning.  The reason we chose eggs, so I keep saying we, it makes it sound like I run some massive  empire.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:20:58):**  It's just me really.  So, the Royal we.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:01):**  When I was first starting off, just to make sure that people wanted an egg, a different  type of egg, I was like, how is our product going to be different?  And those conversations with chefs were really, really interesting.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:15):**  The biggest problems they were having with eggs at the time were related to freshness.  They when people put, and I didn't know a lot about eggs.  I wasn't someone that was poaching eggs every weekend for breakfast.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:28):**  So didn't know this and learned a lot very quickly.  Chefs when they go to poach an egg, the egg needs to be super fresh.  Otherwise it just, the water they sort of crack it into it, just the egg goes everywhere  
**[0:21:38-0:21:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:38):**  and it's not only a waste of their time, but it's a waste of the cost of the egg itself.  So if we could guarantee, which we do, that these eggs were going to be less than 48 hours  old when we delivered them to them, that seemed to be something that they were pretty keen  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:53):**  on.  So that was our first six months.  So we knew that the product was good.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:21:59):**  We knew that the animal welfare side, we hoped, I mean, these chickens were getting treated  better than I was in summer.  So I hope that the welfare side was up to scratch.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:08):**  But you're right about the nervousness for the subscription because this is what it was.  I almost felt like a big pilot.  So we took a group and piloted the program for about three months going, is this weird?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:19):**  Like are people willing to not only pay in advance, but it's not just that.  They're getting their eggs from one of, like from a hub somewhere in Newcastle in the Hunter.  They're not going to the supermarket to get it.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:32):**  They're not exchanging cash for this.  It's a very different feeling.  And so we had quite a few learnings from that.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:40):**  But what we realized very quickly is that we didn't really want to change people's existing  behavior too much straight away.  So if they were already going in for a coffee, we wanted them to be able to pick up their  
**[0:22:53-0:23:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:22:53):**  eggs at the same time.  So we partnered with hubs.  We now have about 25, but the hubs are really popular cafes that have regular customers.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:03):**  So they're already getting their morning coffee before they go to work or in this COVID environment,  they're getting their morning coffee because they want to get out of the house.  In the early days, Sarah also had success finding customers through selling at local  
**[0:23:15-0:23:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:15):**  farmers markets.  However, she quickly realized that while these customers were loyal, it wasn't the channel  that would enable her business to scale.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:25):**  Everyone was so supportive and we would sell out every Sunday.  But at the same time, they weren't necessarily going to be the same customers that would  be subscribers because people going to the farmer's market were...  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:39):**  That was their routine.  That's like an outing.  It's an activity.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:42):**  So then suggesting that they actually pick up these eggs from somewhere else, that wasn't  really going to happen.  I think to that original question is, were they going to the cafe or were they coming  
**[0:23:51-0:24:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:23:51):**  for us or did they know us?  I think it was a combination because the cafes that we partnered with, Newcastle just seems  to be this amazing community that really supports, I don't know, new ideas and trying things.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:03):**  It's a great market for testing ideas out.  So the cafes were super keen on supporting local and when they could put a face to the  brand as well, that was helpful.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:12):**  So social media played a part there in increasing awareness.  But I think also we got a little bit of traction social media wise.  People would ask us and we would ask them, where would you like the next hub to be?  
**[0:24:26-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:26):**  And that sort of style.  And look, not all the hubs have worked out.  And we've learned a lot about that sort of process as well.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:33):**  So yeah, I think it's a combination about knowing the brand and knowing the hubs themselves.  That theme of constant improvement and lean is coming through again, like just all the  testing and trialing of different things that you're doing.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:44):**  Was that really intentional?  Were you designing and running experiments or more just something that kind of came through  from your time in other industries?  
**[0:24:53-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:24:53):**  I think, I mean, there's always the models and lean and sort of round the plan, do check  act, come back again, like that cycle of improvement.  I think for farmers in general too, that is just, that's just how you operate.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:06):**  So to your point, I don't think there were formal experiments, not like I would have  said done in the banking world or mining world because you're trying to bring people along.  I mean, it's the luxury also of having a very, very, very small team.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:19):**  So you can be quite agile from that perspective.  So I think, yes, that was absolutely intentional to be like, let's test something with, we  have no fear of it not working.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:31):**  I don't think it was potentially going to impact the brand.  The only thing that we've seen on the downside of testing something is when a hub doesn't  work out, you've usually got, you could have 10 or 15 people that are like severely disappointed  
**[0:25:43-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:43):**  that they now can't collect their eggs from that hub and managing that.  You're having a conversation with every one of these people because they feel like it's  a two way street.  
**[0:25:52-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:25:52):**  They feel like, and they are supporting you and have bought into this and they're emotionally  connected to this.  And now you feel like you're seriously disappointing them.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:00):**  So often those people will then travel to a different hub to collect their eggs.  It's quite, it's really lovely, the support, but you do feel like you've let a few people  down along the way too.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:12):**  You can certainly hear just how much Sarah's customers mean to her.  And it's an interesting perspective because such a strong customer focus is actually quite  unique in agriculture.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:22):**  It means she needs to be across every aspect of the customer experience from attracting  and retaining subscribers to their enjoyment of the end product.  Her background in business has helped, but she says she needed to outsource some of the  
**[0:26:37-0:26:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:37):**  other skills required.  There's quite a range of skills required and I certainly don't have all of those skills.  I have contracted out, so the creative side being the design of our packaging and the  
**[0:26:50-0:27:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:26:50):**  website, even the design that goes on our delivery van, all that sort of stuff.  I've worked with a great company called Head Jam here in Newcastle who are fabulous and  have gone beyond being just, not to say just the design, but just the creative.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:27:05):**  They really helped me balance ideas around how this business might work.  And to be honest, they're way more trendy than me, so they're probably, they've got  more of a feel for what's going on in Newcastle.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:27:17):**  So I got a good feel as to what might work, might not as just one sort of tool of information.  I am lucky also though that I have been able to draw on some skills from prior learning  so that the lean side has definitely come into play along the way, especially the continuous  
**[0:27:36-0:27:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:27:36):**  improvement and really trying to dig deep into who is our actual customer.  But that probably takes us to that next point around, I don't know if you have a commodity  based business, there's certainly some of the learnings that we've, sorry, some of the  
**[0:27:51-0:28:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:27:51):**  things we've done here that would apply to the commodity side.  But I also have the luxury of being in a community like Newcastle itself where I can go and speak  to my actual customer, the end customer, I mean, like the end person who's consuming  
**[0:28:05-0:28:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:05):**  this product.  And really, I think that was where some of that, the Nuffield research that I undertook,  which really looked at what are the emotional motivators for these customers?  
**[0:28:17-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:17):**  And more importantly, I could guess what they are or make some assumptions, but how do I  actually go and find out?  And that was more about going and sitting with our customers when they're using the  
**[0:28:26-0:28:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:26):**  eggs and really asking them some questions rather than me just sort of making an assumption  or sort of incremental improvements on what we were doing.  Yeah, again, that's such a parallel to the startup world.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:38):**  I mean, literally, that's what we coach startups to do.  And the companies that we end up investing in have really nailed that customer value  proposition as it's called and the business model that delivers it really well.  
**[0:28:51-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:28:51):**  And you've exactly hit on it.  You know, farmers are really good at continuous improvement and that lean iterative approach.  But sometimes on the customer side, either that's not possible or just hasn't been thought  
**[0:29:02-0:29:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:02):**  of to go that far and really understand the end consumer.  Tell me a little bit more about what other examples have you seen of farmers doing this  kind of thing globally?  
**[0:29:11-0:29:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:11):**  Yeah, Nuffield was an amazing experience with the intent of being given the scholarship  to go and find best practice learnings across the world and bring that back and share that.  So for me, my topic was around, well, farming businesses with a passion for excellence.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:30):**  And yeah, so you're right, the opportunity to visit these farms that were just, they  just are obsessed with their customers.  And some of them are big, like, and sort of just like, okay, what are you doing?  
**[0:29:42-0:29:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:42):**  Like actually having this conversation.  So you're able to sort of stand there, watch what they're doing.  But once you're watching their operation, actually make a phone call back and be like,  
**[0:29:50-0:30:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:29:50):**  okay, I really want to talk to you about why you or how you're doing this with your customers.  And some of the examples, I think of two or three, one would be a strawberry farmer in  the Netherlands.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:02):**  He was really interesting because he knew that certain things like convenience, customer  service or I don't know, quality, reliability, all those things are great sort of attributes  to have in a product.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:14):**  But he knew that he had to have an amazing strawberry product itself.  And what he then chose, like, I want to focus on one other thing.  And for him it was flexibility, which engendered an extraordinary amount of loyalty from his  
**[0:30:27-0:30:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:27):**  wholesale customers.  So to give you an example, and I'll sort of put them into two baskets.  He had the Japanese market, so he was exporting to Japan and he was also exporting to other  
**[0:30:37-0:30:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:37):**  parts of Europe.  But they're two really, really different customers.  He was able to figure out that the Japanese were so particular about their strawberries  
**[0:30:47-0:30:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:47):**  that he could get from them the exact size of the strawberries they want.  For example, between 13 to 15 grams per strawberry.  When positioned in the punnet, the strawberries had to be all facing the same way, all on  
**[0:30:57-0:31:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:30:57):**  bubble wrap, all of the same color or a certain color against a color chart.  And then for an additional premium, he was able to get the thicknesses just through,  I want to say closeness, not geographical closeness, but the intimacy piece through  
**[0:31:11-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:11):**  discussions with the end customer.  He was able to find out that I'm not sure if you've ever noticed, but when you've got  a punnet of strawberries, the sort of the dead leaves, those little brown leaves that  
**[0:31:21-0:31:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:21):**  might be in the bottom of the punnet itself.  So he was able to find out that the Japanese would pay more for this product if he could  get rid of those brown leaves out of the punnet itself.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:31):**  And so he came up, as farmers do, they were like, yeah, no worries, I can sort this out.  Came out with a really simple solution of the conveyor and compressed air to just to  get those leaves out and then attract a premium for that product.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:46):**  But in addition to that, he's like, okay, not all my strawberries are going to be 13  to 15 grams of a particular color, et cetera.  What am I going to do with the rest of them?  
**[0:31:54-0:32:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:31:54):**  And he'd already had the European market and where he was looking there, I mean, where  he was removing waste from his process.  So not food waste, but waste being defects or rework or transportation, like rehandling  
**[0:32:07-0:32:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:07):**  your product, like double handling sort of thing.  He was like, the Europeans were quite happy to have strawberries that weren't on those  bubble wrap punnets all facing the same way.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:17):**  They actually quite liked them.  As long as they were of a certain quality, they met a certain low quality standard, they  were happy for those strawberries to be picked straight off the vine, put into a cardboard  
**[0:32:27-0:32:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:27):**  punnet into a larger box.  But those cardboard punnets were going straight to the market.  So there was no double handling.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:34):**  They were coming straight off the vine into what would be the end packaging for the consumer.  And they were absolutely meeting a quality standard.  And yeah, you had no rework and no double handling.  
**[0:32:45-0:33:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:32:45):**  And he hasn't necessarily gone through some lean Six Sigma formal process.  That's just him knowing that if I get this right with the customer and the more precise  I can be with my customer, how much more value that creates for them.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:01):**  I love that story.  I also love your use of rework.  I'm also a big nerd and like systems and processes and like continuous improvement diagrams.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:10):**  So I don't usually get to talk about rework, but we could nerd out on that.  I hate it.  Like I literally start twitching when we see it here.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:20):**  Just rework and double handling is a big thing, but just watching someone when we know how  something's supposed to be done and then we're like, Hey, hang on.  That didn't happen that way.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:29):**  I'm sure everyone's the same.  Well, I'm not sure actually.  Like I think there's a lot of in any business, not just in farming or agriculture, there's  
**[0:33:35-0:33:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:35):**  a lot of, well, we've always done it this way.  And it's, it is hard, like both emotionally, mentally, and actually just time and cost-wise  to challenge how you've done things and think about doing them differently.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:44):**  So I think that's pretty unique to be always seeking out that improvement, even though  it, you know, we all, all want to improve, but doing the hard work to actually improve  is not as easy.  
**[0:33:53-0:34:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:33:53):**  I'll give you actually an example of that.  Like for me, what those sort of things shine through is if we can attach a dollar value  to it and it might, it was a bit like the ground eggs, like an egg being laid on the  
**[0:34:04-0:34:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:04):**  ground, how much lost revenue.  And when you can describe that to the rest of the team, everyone's like, oh crap, wow.  But there was a nursery, a tomato nursery in Japan that we visited.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:14):**  And I mean, the Japanese obviously are renowned for continuous improvement.  I mean, that's where sort of the Toyota continuous improvement system came from.  But I just like this really basic example and I'm sure people can relate to it once  
**[0:34:26-0:34:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:26):**  sort of they think about it.  They would have their employees turn up for work.  And if we just looked at the basic tools, they were using just a pair of secateurs to  
**[0:34:35-0:34:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:35):**  harvest the tomatoes.  What they were finding just from watching people work, this was a startup that had gone,  that had scaled really quickly.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:43):**  So this was sort of early on in the scaling days.  People were really searching to find the tools and just to put a basic timer on that, if  someone spent sort of 10 minutes searching for a pair of secateurs every morning times  
**[0:34:57-0:35:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:34:57):**  that by the number of employees, it worked out just per employee that it would equate  to about 60 hours in a year just looking for a pair of secateurs, which I don't know, 25  bucks an hour, what's that, 1500 bucks or something in a year just looking for a tool.

You could be looking for a spanner to do some repairs on your tractor or whatever it might.  I mean, we still do it here.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:20):**  So the behavior being like the shadow board creation, which a lot of workshops would have  now.  So now this is where your tool is, let's just go straight here, et cetera.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:29):**  But it was like, actually it was a really nice little basic example of some numbers  attached to it and going, Oh my God, this is almost embarrassing.  I guess that's kind of where I wanted to go next, Sarah, is like, what changes do you,  
**[0:35:44-0:35:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:44):**  have you guys applied if any to the beef operation or like what lessons would you have or insights  for maybe more commodity producers who aren't thinking as much about innovating the business  model, but are there opportunities to embody these lessons of continuous improvement and  
**[0:35:59-0:36:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:35:59):**  customer intimacy in even those more traditional businesses?  So for our beef business, and I've only just taken over the beef business probably in the  last 12 months because my father was running out and he passed away last year.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:12):**  So we, I think for me, it's now, okay, what, had to ask the question, what do we want to  do with the beef business?  How do we want to run it?  
**[0:36:21-0:36:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:21):**  And we will look to shift it, I think I'm saying this and it's one of those ones where  you say it out loud, then hopefully it happens.  We'll shift it to more consumer, consumer facing, not all of that business, so maybe  
**[0:36:33-0:36:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:33):**  sort of 20% of it, but the commodity business still, we can still apply a lot of aspects  of lean and we have been doing that over the years.  And that's, that wasn't as basic as going and look at, go and see sort of one basic  
**[0:36:46-0:36:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:46):**  term, go and have a look at other operations that are doing things well and see what you  can learn from them.  Another big piece was the standardization.  
**[0:36:53-0:37:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:36:53):**  So whilst everyone goes off at their animals, you can't create stand like sort of stuff  if something, you know, and it's something inevitably happens and I'm like, well, yes,  but we've learned even with the chickens that we can predict to a certain degree how long  
**[0:37:09-0:37:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:09):**  an improvement will take or if we put a little bit of the labor in here, it will change their  behavior and their routine.  So I think for us, it's been about standardizing what we do and simplifying.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:23):**  We also would probably look a little bit at, I mean, I was calling it production control.  I don't know.  That's just probably from the mining days of producing the amount, the exact amount  
**[0:37:34-0:37:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:34):**  of rather than producing as much as possible, I think is probably something we need to think  about.  So that was the same with the chickens.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:42):**  So with the chooks, we knew we were chasing a sort of a margin business there.  So we don't need to scale.  We're not chasing another 10,000 birds.  
**[0:37:51-0:38:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:37:51):**  For me, it's more about how to create more customer value with the product we have from  that perspective.  I think it is a little bit harder for the commodity business.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:00):**  I think the lean application is absolutely doable.  That's a no brainer and that's just looking at removing waste from the process itself.  My thing that we have done with the beef too is looked at a value stream map.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:14):**  And I mean, basically for me, that's just plotting out, sitting down with the team,  like anyone in your team to do with the cattle business, plotting out what we do with the  product from start to finish, from when they're carving or getting ready to carve all the  
**[0:38:27-0:38:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:27):**  way through to the sale of the villa or whatever it might be and go, okay, then think about  waste.  And I think that's where people sort of trying to get their head around what is actually  
**[0:38:36-0:38:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:36):**  waste.  And there's some really good books and information out there on defining that.  There's a great book called The Lean Farm by Ben Hartman that actually looks at the  
**[0:38:45-0:38:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:45):**  practicalities day to day of that from a horticultural context.  But for me, it's like, how do we remove the rework?  How do we remove doing more than we need to?  
**[0:38:55-0:39:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:38:55):**  That's something that we have to learn for the chickens because no matter what, we're  always going to look after the chickens really, really well.  But we have to put that filter over it going, okay, what are the customers also willing  
**[0:39:08-0:39:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:08):**  to pay for from that perspective?  So yeah, I think there are learnings for the commodity business, but I think it's more  on the lean side and standardization of processes, removing unplanned maintenance, removing rework.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:21):**  So machinery, mechanically things failing, et cetera.  You're like, okay, dig to the root cause.  And that I think that's natural for a lot of farmers to look for what is the root cause  
**[0:39:30-0:39:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:30):**  here rather than just the bandaid solution.  But that's just something that's built into what we do now.  Sarah, there's so many parallels here with startups.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:39):**  And I guess that's been one of the insights of this conversation for me is how much applies  from other industries.  One of the big things we talk about with startups is doing non-scalable things to figure out  
**[0:39:48-0:39:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:48):**  what scales and the perch example like Owen, and if you have to do it every day manually,  but if over time you don't and that has a big improvement, that's worth doing that non-scalable  task.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:39:59):**  And I think there's lots of examples of that approach and it's exactly the same in the  tech and startup world.  It's really interesting talking to you about that because I've not really thought about  
**[0:40:07-0:40:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:07):**  it from the parallels to the startup perspective, but it's exactly what I suppose it is.  It is also a startup business.  And I think you do get asked the question, would you franchise or would you scale it?  
**[0:40:17-0:40:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:17):**  And I think for me, the bit I'm enjoying has been, okay, how do we perfect this?  What could be seen actually as a pilot for something else, but at the same time, I'm  quite happy with the size we're at and we will probably look to diversify or our product  
**[0:40:33-0:40:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:33):**  range here on the farm to utilize this fixed asset more effectively or even add value added  products to our current line as opposed to how do we go and replicate this somewhere  else.  
**[0:40:46-0:41:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:40:46):**  I think also I'm a mild control freak.  So I think the customer piece for me, if I was looking at what's scalable, I'd really  have to get my head around and I'm sure a lot of people have to think this too.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:00):**  How do you scale the customer intimacy piece?  It's actually the question we're asking at the moment.  How do we scale this customer intimacy piece?  
**[0:41:10-0:41:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:10):**  It has a really authentic, genuine feel to it.  Social media can only do so much.  I'm sure there's a tech piece there.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:18):**  I'm just not tech savvy enough to have the answer to that, but there's something that's  probably the biggest question for us at the moment.  I really look forward to hearing and watching how you answer that.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:30):**  Last question from me, Sarah, how did you come up with the name?  So when I looked it up, I totally thought Just Been Laid would have been used by someone  else.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:43):**  I was like, there's no way.  But when I typed it into the business register, I was like, oh my gosh, really?  Okay.  
**[0:41:49-0:42:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:41:49):**  And it's a hundred percent to do with the freshness of the eggs.  That's our competitive advantage or the piece that differentiates us.  So it seemed quite fitting.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:42:02):**  And that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.  I should mention another cool aspect of Sarah's business is that any leftover eggs are immediately  donated to Oz Harvest, a food rescue charity.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/11/18/farming-eggs-the-startup-way-sarah-sivyer#t=0:42:14):**  If you've enjoyed this episode, please leave us a review or tell your friends and colleagues.

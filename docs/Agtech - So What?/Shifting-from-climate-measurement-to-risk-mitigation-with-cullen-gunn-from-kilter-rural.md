### Agtech - So What?  (2022-12-14)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by Tenacious Ventures.  I'm Sarah Nolet.  A reminder, don't forget to stick around until the end of today's show for some fresh insights  
**[0:00:12-0:00:20](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:00:12):**  on our Raising Out Loud journey.  And make sure you visit the website in the show notes for more info.  Now onto the show.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:31](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:00:20):**  When people talk about climate-related risk in agriculture, I think it's totally natural  and in a lot of ways really good that people want to talk first about the historic trends  and then about climate models and projections.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:44](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:00:31):**  But when it comes to mitigating risk in the long run, a focus on historical science and  data can sometimes be misleading.  In the context of a climate change future that almost makes history irrelevant in some  
**[0:00:44-0:00:52](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:00:44):**  respects, it averages a nonsense.  That's not where we are.  You're talking about an extra one or two degrees of energy in the atmosphere that is just going  
**[0:00:52-0:01:06](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:00:52):**  to completely transform how the climate works.  My name is Cullen Gunn, CEO and Executive Director of Kilter Rural, which has been operating  in the natural capital space since 2004, focusing on investing in rural landscapes, water and  
**[0:01:06-0:01:19](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:01:06):**  ecosystem protection and mitigating climate change.  I wanted to talk with Cullen about his vision for managing ag landscapes under chaotic conditions  and how that fits into the larger social and economic discussions around scope three emissions  
**[0:01:19-0:01:29](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:01:19):**  and mitigating production risk.  Today, we tackle these topics and dig into where technology might enable progress on  anything from better reporting to actual change.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:39](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:01:29):**  It all starts with learning a little more about how Cullen came to invest in farmland  in the first place.  We come from a variety of backgrounds, but had spent a lot of time with organizations  
**[0:01:39-0:01:47](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:01:39):**  like Landcare.  My actual first job was as a coordinator of Landcare groups and then distributing a lot  of government programs over a series of years.  
**[0:01:47-0:02:01](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:01:47):**  The first sale of Telstra generated a billion dollars for investment in basically the environment.  We all thought that would solve all the issues in the world.  And really, it just disappeared very quickly without much of a legacy.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:16](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:02:01):**  So for us, we thought there's got to be another way to get capital into rural landscapes and  regenerating rural landscapes.  We were very fortunate to bump into an organization in 2003 that was keenly looking to reinvest  
**[0:02:16-0:02:24](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:02:16):**  back into rural and regional Victoria.  And that was a group called VicSuper.  They had a CEO at the time called Bob Welsch, who looking back was light years.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:36](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:02:24):**  Ahead of everybody else and probably still is in many respects with regard to looking  at ecosystem protection, climate change and how you produce food.  So we met them and they were interested in what we were suggesting.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:47](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:02:36):**  And we said, look, could we put a proposal to you for you to invest in the regeneration  of natural capital assets in rural Victoria and being a Victorian superfund.  They liked it.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:55](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:02:47):**  I wouldn't say they liked it immediately everywhere.  I think the first time we presented, the chairman of the board said, I wouldn't touch this with  a 30 foot pole.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:02](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:02:55):**  That's three times your usual length of your usual poles there that you don't touch things  with.  It took us two years to work through that.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:15](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:03:02):**  And ultimately they committed $200 million to our thesis, which was fantastic.  And we've been delivering in that space now for 18 years.  Did you have to change the thesis at all as you were talking to them?  
**[0:03:15-0:03:28](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:03:15):**  I guess my kind of broader question is around how interested were people in Regen or some  of the principles you were talking about that feel a bit too squishy or far out there?  We did have to change proposal a bit.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:42](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:03:28):**  So I think the first bit of modeling we did was really trying to invest in ecosystem services  and see if we could get the superfund paid for that.  And that was just too advanced.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:03:42):**  I think so.  Explaining ecosystem services, explaining biodiversity probably wasn't that easy back  then.  
**[0:03:48-0:04:00](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:03:48):**  I don't know if you'd remember this, but there was a thing called the action plan for  salinity and water quality, which was another multi-billion dollar program nationally.  That was supposed to be the action plan for biodiversity protection, but people prosecuting  
**[0:04:00-0:04:12](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:04:00):**  the culture couldn't make politicians understand biodiversity.  So they called it water quality.  So we had a similar issue trying to talk to trustees, directors about ecosystems, carbon  
**[0:04:12-0:04:25](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:04:12):**  sequestration, biodiversity protection.  It was pretty bold to go in with that as the core focus and ultimately wrong, I think,  because you're talking about rural landscapes where you're really thinking about the community  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:04:25):**  in those landscapes.  You've got to think about what they're familiar with.  They're familiar with agriculture.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:39](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:04:29):**  So we came back from an ecosystem focus to farming and ecosystem, which makes a lot more  sense anyway.  Are you going to produce returns when markets for those other services didn't exist?  
**[0:04:39-0:04:47](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:04:39):**  So it did it more significantly.  I can absolutely say that every bit of modeling we did was wrong.  Every model I've ever done is wrong.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:58](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:04:47):**  Actually, they're not unuseful, but they're always wrong.  So your best laid plans always change.  When we fast forward to today, one of the things we want to talk about, Colin, is the  
**[0:04:58-0:05:08](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:04:58):**  pressure around climate related disclosures.  There's a bunch of kind of alphabet soup out there, TCFD, TNFD, et cetera.  Is that something that you guys are paying attention to and kind of feeling pressure  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:05:08):**  around?  Pressure is probably not the right way I'd describe it.  There's certainly lots of questions.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:23](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:05:15):**  If you go back to our genesis in 2004, one of the three things we had to deliver.  So first was sustainable food.  The second was ecosystem protection.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:32](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:05:23):**  And the third was climate change mitigation.  So in an on ground action sense, we've been trying to deliver against climate change for  a long time.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:44](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:05:32):**  What tends to happen is the frameworks come later and the frameworks are for groups of  probably looking for ways and comprehensive and coordinated ways to assess things.  I think that's what the TCFD is.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:53](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:05:44):**  It's just a framework for assessing risk at the moment and looking at opportunities.  But there's another step to action.  Now, we are getting asked probably more internationally.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:04](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:05:53):**  So any international investors we speak to, and we've probably done 50 or 60 meetings  with international investors over the last eight months, they will always ask if it's  not about climate change, it's always about ESG.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:12](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:06:04):**  How do you report?  How do you account what you're doing?  You're telling us you're delivering these great landscape outcomes or water donations.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:26](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:06:12):**  How do you measure the impact of your activity?  So it's probably a bit more tangible than just pressure on climate change.  Although I think that the sort of whole climate change discussion is making institutional  
**[0:06:26-0:06:36](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:06:26):**  investors particularly and high net worth really question what they're investing in  and what impact is that having, whether it's climate change or biodiversity, those sort  of two things are merging together a little bit.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:45](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:06:36):**  Hence, you've got the TNFD as well now.  So it's not so much pressure, but we don't feel it as a pressure anyway, but maybe others  do.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:53](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:06:45):**  But there's certainly questions, a much more comprehensive investment framework.  And how do you think about answering those questions?  What types of solutions do you have?  
**[0:06:53-0:07:07](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:06:53):**  Or will you need to support answering those questions, not just in a due diligence meeting,  but also kind of ongoing reporting against what they're looking for?  I do think something like the TNFD helps because it gives a coordinated way to think about  
**[0:07:07-0:07:15](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:07:07):**  things that everybody can use.  But there is absolutely a benefit to having a standardised approach to how you assess  these things.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:26](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:07:15):**  For us, one of the key challenges over the years is how do we report and prove what we've  been doing?  So we've undertaken an enormous variety of actions at an on ground level to mitigate  
**[0:07:26-0:07:38](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:07:26):**  climate change or prepare for weather events.  And we're talking millions of dollars in landscapes to deal with these things.  And so that's been our biggest issue for a long time was how do you capture what you're  
**[0:07:38-0:07:48](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:07:38):**  doing and report it independently?  That's clearly really important, but also scientifically so that it's robust.  And so one of the things we ended up not falling into, but tracking down was the Wentworth  
**[0:07:48-0:08:02](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:07:48):**  Group's Accounting for Nature framework.  And the Accounting for Nature framework allows us to develop environmental condition accounts  each year for the key assets under our stewardship, whether that be water, farmland, farmland  
**[0:08:02-0:08:13](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:08:02):**  soils, native vegetation and fauna.  And so we use that framework across our farming program to report annually on the condition  of the assets.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:24](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:08:13):**  Now, we also set targets for condition.  So if we start with a landscape that's got no veg and it's got a sort of starting score  of two, we might say, right, within five years, we want that to be 10.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:32](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:08:24):**  That might sound like much, but it might be hundreds of woman hectares of reveg.  It's a big sort of program necessarily.  So that's what we've been using.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:42](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:08:32):**  We've been saying, look, we use the TCFD, that's just a risk management framework.  We embed that in our risk management process.  Every decision that the trustees of the board make, that has to consider climate change.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:49](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:08:42):**  But the hard bit is what do you deliver against it?  How are you going to respond?  And so marrying those two things up is something we've been working really hard at.  
**[0:08:49-0:09:02](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:08:49):**  So getting a process to report our actions and linking that to these frameworks for assessing  risk and mitigation of response.  My sense, Colin, is that you have just glossed over, not intentionally, but something that  
**[0:09:02-0:09:15](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:09:02):**  is very different for other stakeholders in this space.  That the idea that even just getting to the point of embedding this kind of risk into  their risk management framework is where most organizations are at today.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:25](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:09:15):**  And there's still even a bit of resistance to doing that, let alone starting to think  about what they're actually going to do about it, how they're actually going to measure  doing those things and how they're going to make sure doing those things has both impact  
**[0:09:25-0:09:34](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:09:25):**  and economic outcomes.  It's really meant to be a compliment that you guys are quite far ahead in this thinking.  Is that consistent with your experience of talking to other organizations that they're  
**[0:09:34-0:09:44](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:09:34):**  really at that step one of just embedding this as a risk question into the framework?  Look, I'm not sure.  It sort of depends where you are in the management spectrum to some degree.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:53](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:09:44):**  If you're in an office in a big city somewhere, theoretically, you can just go through your  life without any climate change impact.  You know, that's like who does this affect the most or directly?  
**[0:09:53-0:10:02](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:09:53):**  And that's why you've got to come back to intergenerational equity and rich versus poor  and the poor are going to suffer the most in this.  You know, kids are going to suffer the most.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:14](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:10:02):**  So you can live a life where if you're wealthy, you're not impacted at all.  But you know, for us managing real assets, if you're not considering the impacts of climate  change and how to mitigate events, it's just insane.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:24](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:10:14):**  We've lived through some of the most profound events in my lifetime in the last decade,  six days over 46 degrees.  We just you watch stuff evaporate in front of your eyes.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:32](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:10:24):**  It's amazing.  And then soon after, followed by the biggest pain event in recent history, it was pretty  fundamental sort of change.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:42](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:10:32):**  And if you're not preparing for those things, if we had a heap of really expensive infrastructure  in floodplains, all washed away, we don't do that.  We let our floodplains flood.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:55](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:10:42):**  We want our floodplains to provide a flood management service.  So it's about matching the asset you've got, the capability it's got and the suitability  in the context of a climate change future that it almost makes history irrelevant in  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:10:55):**  some respects.  It averages a nonsense.  That's not where we are.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:12](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:10:59):**  You're talking about an extra one or two degrees of energy in the atmosphere that is just going  to completely transform how the climate works.  So we spend a lot of time laying out our farms when we buy them so that they can deal with  
**[0:11:12-0:11:27](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:11:12):**  rain events of 80 and 120 milli rain and they get that water off crops.  One of the values of putting vegetation and biodiversity back into landscapes.  So we have a policy across our farms of between 30 and 50 percent goes back to reforestation.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:34](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:11:27):**  People say, why would you do it?  One of the values is it gives us somewhere to push all this blooming water to.  You've just got responses.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:44](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:11:34):**  You've got buffering.  So, you know, that has been enormously helpful for us over the decades.  So if you're not planning for those climate change impacts, I think really you're talking

You're talking about less value.  You're talking about less money ultimately and probably significant community impacts.  
**[0:11:52-0:12:05](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:11:52):**  You raise a really good point there, Colin, about the difference in how someone looking  at a spreadsheet might view some of these decisions versus boots on the ground, seeing  the floodplain, seeing water retention, seeing the impact on the landscapes.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:14](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:12:05):**  Even at Kilter, how do you think about having those conversations?  Does everyone have to get out and see the real assets every now and then?  Or do you ever have any challenges in those kind of different perspectives?  
**[0:12:14-0:12:22](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:12:14):**  Absolutely, we do.  Not necessarily in the ideology around it.  Everyone's pretty wedded to where we're headed and what we've got to prepare for.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:32](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:12:22):**  But it's more about how to and the impact.  Are you going to take a short term kick in the guts financially to plan for cost savings  later when your crop doesn't get wiped out?  
**[0:12:32-0:12:44](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:12:32):**  So balancing those sorts of planning decisions, we had some pretty robust discussion about.  It's not easy and hasn't been easy to put large scale vegetation back into landscapes  because it's expensive.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:53](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:12:44):**  Well, it's not expensive in the scheme of everything else, but it's expensive when you  don't get a return for it in a financial sense.  And then you have to communicate that back to investors.  
**[0:12:53-0:13:04](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:12:53):**  So we were really fortunate, as I said, to start with Vic Super, who were keen to do  it.  But even putting 40 percent of a landscape back to an environmental outcome for carbon  
**[0:13:04-0:13:20](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:13:04):**  sequestration and then finding you're so far in front of the curve, none of it's permissible  after the carbon policy to get credits was pretty frustrating.  You really some of those decisions, the policy frameworks are often miles behind where people  
**[0:13:20-0:13:29](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:13:20):**  want to be.  I mean, it brings up a point that we talk a lot about with ecosystem services is they  kind of especially carbon markets haven't really been built for agriculture.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:39](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:13:29):**  Like they're built for something like forestry, where it's a blank slate, plant the trees  they're going to grow for so long.  And we're not talking about producing food or fiber, whereas additionality in this case,  
**[0:13:39-0:13:48](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:13:39):**  like it's silly you guys have been doing this and yet now can't get recognized for it.  Imagine those that creates some tough decisions, but also conversations in terms of waiter,  go ahead.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:57](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:13:48):**  The additionality stuff's interesting.  I sort of at a high level understand why it's there.  But it's sort of pretty weird that it's cut out the efforts of every land care group,  
**[0:13:57-0:14:07](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:13:57):**  every farmer, every corporate that's tried to do the right thing for the past decade.  It just seems almost idiotic.  You almost got to ask the tree, what's it doing?  
**[0:14:07-0:14:15](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:14:07):**  What's its purpose?  Is it there just to grow and turn into a big stick of carbon?  Or is it there for some other reason?  
**[0:14:15-0:14:26](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:14:15):**  If it says it's there just to look good, you can't get paid for that.  And it has been enormously frustrating watching the policy change over the last decade and  a half and really undermines any sort of market development.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:35](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:14:26):**  Indeed.  Tell me about a couple of the specific projects or decisions you guys have made.  I don't know if there's an example that comes to mind that felt like a pretty tough decision  
**[0:14:35-0:14:43](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:14:35):**  to make, whether that's putting something back to native or spending capital expenditure  that's kind of paid off.  But that felt pretty tough at the time.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:56](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:14:43):**  When we buy farms, we're tending to work or have been working in that undercapitalised,  underutilised sort of farm area.  Like our view is we've already transformed enough of Australian landscapes to farming.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:07](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:14:56):**  It's about regenerating what we've already changed rather than clearing another six or  seven hundred million hectares in northern Australia, whatever it is.  We just don't think that's fundamentally right.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:19](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:15:07):**  Southern Murray-Darling Basin, Queensland, New South Wales, there's heaps of farming.  So whenever we move into a landscape, it's rather how can we do this better?  The key drivers for us initially had been water efficiency.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:30](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:15:19):**  We tending to or have been working in irrigation areas.  So water efficiency is being paramount.  So in that context, old irrigation delivery systems need upgrading.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:41](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:15:30):**  Technology needs upgrading.  So I think when we first started in 2004, it took us three years to get an IT system  to work with the irrigation system so that people could do it remotely.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:50](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:15:41):**  And there was a company called Observant that was very helpful and all that.  But it was a real challenge to be the first to do that and took a lot of sunk costs to  get a system that works.  
**[0:15:50-0:16:00](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:15:50):**  And of course, now there's lots of them and they work everywhere.  Along with that, though, is then how do you think about the landscape?  How do you think about that landscape in the context of not what you're looking at when  
**[0:16:00-0:16:07](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:16:00):**  you're buying.  You know, what happens when we get 150 milli rain in four days, you know, or two days or  12 hours or whatever it might be.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:17](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:16:07):**  So it's really considering, all right, what's the capability and suitability of the place  to deal with that?  Sometimes you don't have a lot of options, but where you do and that's one of the advantages  
**[0:16:17-0:16:26](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:16:17):**  of corporate investment at that scale is you can think differently, not just about a property,  but about the landscape.  And we talk a lot about regenerating landscapes.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:16:26):**  It's not just one farm.  So that farm is linked to a flood plain.  We let that flood plain flood.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:40](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:16:31):**  It doesn't mean you can't use it for other things.  You could still crop it or you could graze it, but its primary purpose is to flood and  deal with floodwaters.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:48](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:16:40):**  We will reorganize those properties so water can drain to a central point and then drain  off those areas.  And that's a big decision.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:57](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:16:48):**  It can cost a lot of money to do that.  Just putting a 1% fall on 100 hectares, that's a lot of dirt moved, but it's proven time  and again to be worthwhile.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:09](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:16:57):**  So for instance, we transformed an area from growing not much at all to being one of the  largest field processing tomato operations in Australia.  And it's between eight and 13 grand a hectare to put in the ground.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:20](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:17:09):**  One year we planted it and three weeks later, I think it was a 80 mil of rain over whatever  it was, eight hours or something.  And there was ducks paddling around in the tomato seedling.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:31](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:17:20):**  Ah well, it was a good effort.  Anyway, all that water was off in 48 hours because our property development manager Brendan  had laid it out appropriately.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:43](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:17:31):**  We had to do a bit of pumping because the volume of water was huge, but that crop survived.  So that's a massive saving that would otherwise have been lost, there's no doubt.  So that's one example.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:56](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:17:43):**  The other in one of our investments, we were really keen to buy up the flood plain as much  of it as we could and remove the levee banks from the river.  We could see it was a choke point in the system with a lot of rain.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:05](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:17:56):**  Levee banks are there to do nothing else and push the flood somewhere else.  People need to realise that they think they're protected.  They're protected until it breaks.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:19](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:18:05):**  Levee banks just build up the pressure and push it somewhere else.  So our view was maybe we could do this differently, remove the levee bank, let the thing flood  right up to a point as far as we could, which will be a road or a railway line or something,  
**[0:18:19-0:18:31](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:18:19):**  probably running through your landscape, do that and then offer a flood management service  or mitigation service for assets downstream.  So I prosecuted this case to the local government and local department and the timing couldn't  
**[0:18:31-0:18:41](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:18:31):**  have been worse really, Sarah, because it was in the middle of the millennium drought.  And it was pretty hard to imagine it ever raining again, let alone flooding.  But that's what I was referring to earlier.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:18:41):**  It did rain again.  It was massive.  That whole flood plain, now we didn't get it all, we couldn't purchase it all, so that  
**[0:18:47-0:18:55](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:18:47):**  was never going to work anyway.  But the idea was right because the government then came in and compulsorily acquired it  all.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:18:55):**  I don't know how much it cost.  It was actually quite sensible policy.  It's just marrying those two things up.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:11](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:18:59):**  The submission of ideas and the timing of them are almost as important as the idea itself.  And pretty hard to time with these natural systems as these examples highlight.  You mentioned the tomatoes.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:19:11):**  Tell me a little bit about the downstream supply chain for you guys.  What kinds of stuff are you growing?  Who are you selling it to?  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:19:16):**  And do you get recognized for the environmental credentials in that downstream supply chain?  More and more.  Yeah.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:19:23):**  So look, we don't do as many tomatoes now.  All those probably have been sold.  We still do some.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:38](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:19:27):**  So those tomatoes go to a company called Kagame, a Japanese company based in Echuca.  I think they're one of the biggest employers in Echuca.  There must be probably two or three hundred people there in peak processing time.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:47](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:19:38):**  And pretty much anything red that you eat in Australia has got some of their tomatoes  in it.  So I'm proud of being part of that food chain, so to speak.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:59](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:19:47):**  Increasingly, yes, they're pretty highly aware of energy and exposure to energy costs and  climate change.  You know, Japanese company, there's some pretty serious policy in Japan around what their  
**[0:19:59-0:20:11](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:19:59):**  organizations have to do around climate change and biodiversity more so nowadays.  So working with those sorts of groups has been really important for us.  We've had a long association with organic grain, which is really a challenging space  
**[0:20:11-0:20:23](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:20:11):**  to be in because you don't have as many levers to pull, but that gets recognized with a premium.  Absolutely.  And the marketplace more broadly, I think we're seeing a lot of not so much on the product  
**[0:20:23-0:20:31](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:20:23):**  side at the moment.  The standard sort of conventional crops don't generate a premium just because you're doing  the right thing in your farmland at the moment.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:38](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:20:31):**  But that might change over time.  I think one of the key things will be traceability.  Where is this coming from?  
**[0:20:38-0:20:45](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:20:38):**  What's it doing to the landscape?  Is it a good outcome, is it a bad outcome?  Is it coming out of the Brazilian rainforest, which has just been cleared, or is it coming  
**[0:20:45-0:20:56](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:20:45):**  from somewhere that's sustainable?  I think those questions will become more front of mind over the next five years, for sure.  And do you think something like Accounting for Nature will be how you prove those credentials?  
**[0:20:56-0:21:04](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:20:56):**  What kinds of systems and frameworks do you see being asked of you to report against to  kind of make those claims?  That is a challenge.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:19](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:21:04):**  And it's a bit like, as I said before, the TCFD has given people a common framework to  assess climate change, which is really important.  One of the challenges in the environmental asset space is that there isn't one system  
**[0:21:19-0:21:27](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:21:19):**  that people are familiar with.  In fact, most people are not familiar with anything and just sort of scratch their head.  Things like self verification and ticks.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:35](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:21:27):**  There's a plethora of them.  I think that's a real challenge.  If I go back to my background, I did spend a bit of time in a previous life reporting  
**[0:21:35-0:21:50](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:21:35):**  on the condition and management of natural resources here in Victoria and pulling together  a series of reports on the condition of natural assets in Victoria.  And the government at the time, and it hasn't changed, really found that a challenging process  
**[0:21:50-0:21:59](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:21:50):**  to have a consistent methodology for assessing and reporting.  Still not there.  And if governments can't do it, it's hard to expect industry to be on top of it.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:07](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:21:59):**  But searching and really pushing ourselves to find something, that's why we liked accounting  for nature.  It is a really sensible framework.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:18](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:22:07):**  It's scientifically robust.  Methodologies for application have to be approved and independently approved.  So you've got that independence built in to how you would measure things, let alone the  
**[0:22:18-0:22:28](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:22:18):**  measurement itself, which you can get independently certified as well.  It's repeatable.  It can be really expensive or it can be really cheap depending on the outcomes you want and  
**[0:22:28-0:22:39](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:22:28):**  what your reporting framework is.  We're at the more expensive end because we want to have the thing as well as we can present  within the context of what we do around soils, fauna and vegetation, for instance.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:48](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:22:39):**  So I think it's a really useful framework.  But going to answer your question quickly, Sarah, will it be the one that wins out?  I don't know.  
**[0:22:48-0:23:01](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:22:48):**  You mentioned cost there a little bit, Colin.  I'm imagining someone listening who runs a farmland fund or is a family farmer or farm  manager and saying that stuff sounds pretty expensive and pretty time consuming.

I think for the individual farmer, it doesn't have to be because it's an open source approach.  So once a method's up there, for a very small fee, you can get access to it and apply it  
**[0:23:12-0:23:24](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:23:12):**  to your farm.  Now, one of the challenges I think the individual will have is things like time to do it.  One of the areas that will, I think, explode and really help this tech and data, I think  
**[0:23:24-0:23:39](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:23:24):**  will be really important in helping generate things like environmental accounts a lot cheaper  than going out there and counting every buck.  It might be as robust, but it will absolutely be doable at a cost effective price for an  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:23:39):**  individual.  I've got no doubt about that.  For an individual use, you never know, you might be able to use that in some sort of  
**[0:23:45-0:23:59](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:23:45):**  discussion with your bank manager around loans and loan rates.  For us, look, I think we'll always be in that higher pricing range.  Now obviously we don't build in necessarily the time of the staff down to the last cent  
**[0:23:59-0:24:13](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:23:59):**  because there's a lot of embedded knowledge we've got here, but in a sort of five to 10,000  hectare landscape, that's eminently doable.  It gives us a point of difference, real point of difference when we're speaking to investors  
**[0:24:13-0:24:27](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:24:13):**  that is a set of environmental accounts using an independently approved methodology with  results that are showing you, we hope the conditions improve against this target.  The other thing that I think will happen and will move quite shortly to do with our next  
**[0:24:27-0:24:37](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:24:27):**  range of funds is get paid on those condition outcomes.  So it's very easy to just come up with a performance fee that's 15 over eight or 20 over six or  whatever.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:46](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:24:37):**  People just punch them out for financial results that sometimes they do have some influence  over.  So if you look at the last five years, capital growth has been a major play, but I think  
**[0:24:46-0:24:57](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:24:46):**  we'll get asked to just have that sort of fee.  It'll be right over well, you're targeting these impact outcomes.  We see it as building value within the underlying asset base you're managing.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:07](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:24:57):**  We want to see you get paid at least a proportion of your fee against these environmental or  impact outcomes.  And I think that would be a pretty terrific sort of next step.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:16](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:25:07):**  It's just how you do that consistently.  You're always in competition with others in the space and there's a lot of greenwashing  out there that can make competition quite difficult.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:24](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:25:16):**  And you can build a rod for your own back being too rigorous when your competitors just  can fly through every hole.  That's really interesting about the incentives.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:34](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:25:24):**  We see that a little bit in our world with venture where fund managers are starting to  tie compensation to not only financial returns, but also to impact and similar challenges  around how do you measure it?  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:25:34):**  How do you scale it?  Those kinds of things.  You mentioned the technology there and how that might help.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:49](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:25:38):**  Is there anything you're looking to or have implemented recently on the technology side  that's helping do this better, whether that's actually data collection and reporting or  actually improving the outcomes themselves?  
**[0:25:49-0:25:59](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:25:49):**  Certainly at a farm delivery level, the techs, it's jumping ahead so fast.  I'm still working ahead to turn my computer on, Sarah, but I am surrounded by really intelligent  people.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:12](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:25:59):**  And the tech at an ag level, I think is spectacular and will jump ahead pretty quickly.  You're still miles off on some things.  Like, wouldn't it be great to have a robotic weeder, for instance, in your organic crops?  
**[0:26:12-0:26:19](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:26:12):**  Now we've obviously looked at that and that they exist for the scale we operate at.  You could never afford to buy the gear.  You've got to get much bigger.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:28](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:26:19):**  So it's all about economies of scale.  Much of that tech application, once it clicks over a certain threshold, it becomes much  cheaper and people can afford it.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:39](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:26:28):**  So I think that's probably a hurdle at the moment in a lot of areas, but geez, that hurdle  disappears pretty quickly, doesn't it, with a slight change in policy setting or a slight  change in uptake.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:49](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:26:39):**  It's dramatic.  So I'd expect enormous advances just at an ag delivery level.  I think more on the biophysical monitoring side, I reckon that will jump ahead too.  
**[0:26:49-0:27:00](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:26:49):**  It's just people turning their minds to it.  We get emails from people every day with various forms of GIS and related platform data that  can tell you what's going on every microsecond.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:27:00):**  And it can be hard to wade through them all and just having the time to wade through them  all.  So it can be a challenge to keep on top of it.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:14](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:27:07):**  We do let a lot of things fly through to the keeper and review those that really do stand  out.  So you mentioned autonomy, you mentioned irrigation.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:26](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:27:14):**  How about on the biological, like on the input side, are you guys looking at anything different  in terms of whether that's price stability given where prices are at or different types  of biological products or what have you looked at there?  
**[0:27:26-0:27:38](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:27:26):**  We've had a long association with trying to develop the capacity of our soils.  That's really in a bit with our farming landscapes and really desperately trying to move away  from synthetics.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:51](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:27:38):**  I don't mean that in a all synthetics are bad view.  You look where we are at the moment, the cost of those inputs is phenomenal.  So if you can move from chemistry to biology a bit more and you don't get the biological  
**[0:27:51-0:28:04](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:27:51):**  sort of part of your soil working, we're spending a lot of time at that level, which, yeah,  it's not easy.  We spent probably close enough to 15 years trying to capture carbon in soils, not just  
**[0:28:04-0:28:12](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:28:04):**  for soil carbon sequestration.  That sort of was pie in the sky stuff and might still be.  We'll have to wait and see.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:26](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:28:12):**  But getting your soils to operate with better infiltration, better soil water relationships,  better nutrient availability, it's fundamental to the farming system.  I mean, we've tried all sorts of things, some of them very invasive and probably a little  
**[0:28:26-0:28:40](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:28:26):**  silly like putting organic material into quite degraded soil affected by salinity, which  actually didn't work.  I don't reckon it's quite hard to measure some of those things, but we'll keep trialing  
**[0:28:40-0:28:50](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:28:40):**  how we deal with it.  But mostly we're falling back now to things like just different cropping regimes, less  tillage, really simple stuff that it's not rocket science necessarily.  
**[0:28:50-0:29:01](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:28:50):**  But getting the mix right for any given environment is quite a challenge.  We're working pretty hard at that.  We've done a number of research projects around carbon in soils and how easy or difficult  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:29:01):**  it is to do that.  I think we did one 10 years ago.  We're in an arid environment.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:13](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:29:05):**  I can't remember the exact outcome, Sarah, but I think it was yes, you could sequester  carbon if you didn't touch it a thousand years ago.  Oh, fantastic.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:21](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:29:13):**  I don't think investors are quite that long term.  We'll have to think about that a different way.  So some of those things are really challenging.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:32](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:29:21):**  We do have projects in the carbon market around soil, which we're just exploring.  We've got some great research relationships, but it's pretty advanced sort of biological  approaches that we're trialing.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:46](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:29:32):**  Do you think, Colin, that a model like PILTR would work in the US or North America, for  example, like given the different landscape of subsidies and things like that?  Do you think that there's kind of fundamental differences there in terms of the risk tools  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:29:46):**  or investor appetite?  Or do you think a model like that would work elsewhere?  I would have thought so.  
**[0:29:52-0:30:05](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:29:52):**  I mean, our model would be much easier if we had subsidies.  If we're in the UK and they've just changed from getting paid not to grow stuff to paid  for environmental outcomes, that would just be fantastic.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:16](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:30:05):**  I've been advocating for environmental markets like that for 35 years.  I don't know enough about the US and how it operates really, Sarah, to say, but I would  have thought it could absolutely work.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:28](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:30:16):**  And we know anecdotally and directly that there's lots of farmers over there doing what  we're doing and doing a bit with a much longer timeframe, 20 and 30 years, 40 years.  And it's where the silent spring began, wasn't it?  
**[0:30:28-0:30:43](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:30:28):**  I'm curious as we wrap up here, why do you personally care about this stuff?  And when it gets tough, when something doesn't work out or nature comes at you full force,  how do you avoid too much discouragement or maybe it's around the greenwashing?  
**[0:30:43-0:30:58](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:30:43):**  What kind of keeps you going in this space?  Personally, it's going to sound a bit over the top, but it really is a personal love  of Australian landscapes and Australian flora and fauna.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:06](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:30:58):**  I get very homesick when I go overseas.  It's great to be in Europe and see green in the middle of summer, but I really do get  very homesick with the country.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:17](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:31:06):**  If you think about the range of species we have here that occur nowhere else in the world,  I don't know what it is, is it 40 million years of isolation or 80 million years of  isolation, gondwana, even.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:26](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:31:17):**  There's some species that are just extraordinary.  Constantly get excited when I see fauna in our landscapes.  And so do most of the staff here.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:37](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:31:26):**  It's not just a trait or something we force on people.  People join us because they like that side of it.  But it's always a challenge to marry that up with returns or has been to date.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:50](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:31:37):**  I think it's much more promising outlook than there's ever been in my working life for getting  paid for doing the right thing on your landscapes.  Despite the opportunities we haven't been able to capture along the way, I do think  
**[0:31:50-0:32:01](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:31:50):**  with a good set of environmental accounts, so you can measure change.  You've got a chance to be paid for that change, whether it starts with just carbon or it's  carbon plus environmental outcomes.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:11](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:32:01):**  I have never seen it look so promising.  Especially given the position we at Tenacious find ourselves in today, it's fascinating  to hear what someone like Cullen, who's in a slightly different but related investment  
**[0:32:11-0:32:21](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:32:11):**  field is reckoning with.  A few key ideas have really stuck out to me since we spoke.  First, making the link that Cullen made between measuring and reporting outcomes around environmental  
**[0:32:21-0:32:28](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:32:21):**  work and risk mitigation.  I think intuitively these two activities sound like the same thing, but they're actually  not.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:37](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:32:28):**  Measurement is something we've talked about time and again on this podcast.  And from the boots on the ground perspective, growers are still figuring out what works  on their landscapes and for their business.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:47](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:32:37):**  Reporting can be a whole other ballgame, not only to communicate the real impact, but to  do so in a way that means something to audiences as diverse as supply chain partners or superfund  managers.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:56](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:32:47):**  And neither of those activities necessarily translates into helping a producer understand  the climate-related risks they're actually facing, let alone whether their actions are  mitigating them.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:08](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:32:56):**  Though this last step is likely to be the most important financially.  We've built some of our most important ag tech theses around these three steps and the  fact that none of them are nearly as figured out, let alone linked, as some would believe.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:20](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:33:08):**  Second, I loved Cullen's point that when we talk about the likely future effects of  climate change, the past is, well, kind of irrelevant.  When we talk with folks all over ag tech, there's a ton of discussion about modeling  
**[0:33:20-0:33:30](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:33:20):**  and predicting climate risk.  And something that's often overlooked is that over the last decade or more, we've  mostly proven that we're really quite bad at predicting how the climate is changing.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:41](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:33:30):**  From our perspective, this reality has got to fit in to both our understanding of the  future and what entrepreneurs and investors promise about their solutions.  And I appreciate Cullen pointing out that saying we're being conservative given the  
**[0:33:41-0:33:54](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:33:41):**  10-year trend might not be being conservative at all, because the one thing we know is that  the next 10 years are unlikely to be very similar to the last 10.  And finally, I'm still wondering about Cullen's conviction around tying management fees to  
**[0:33:54-0:34:04](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:33:54):**  environmental outcomes.  I worry, as Cullen himself pointed out, that greenwashing is still a real problem, not  just in agriculture, but across climate-concerned industries.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:16](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:34:04):**  And business models that tie financial outcomes to numbers that can be, or at least perceived  to be, quite flawed seems highly risky.  But that being said, thinking about the story of the flooded tomato field that was saved,  
**[0:34:16-0:34:26](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:34:16):**  it seems pretty obvious that thoughtful environmental management has a direct link to better financial  performance.  That's definitely how we think at Tenacious that investing through an impact lens is what's  
**[0:34:26-0:34:36](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:34:26):**  going to drive both impact and returns.  Before we say goodbye, I want to share a bit more of our Raising Out Loud journey.  This week, we've been thinking a lot about the journey of fundraising itself, how it  
**[0:34:36-0:34:45](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:34:36):**  squares with the process of a startup fundraising, and how positivity gets used as a tactic to  drive attention, even if it's a bit manufactured.  Here's Matthew.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:58](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:34:45):**  Yesterday, I sat down with a founder who's currently raising, and of course my first  question to them was, so how's fundraising going?  And I, maybe I'm imagining it, but like to me, the person's eyes shrunk a little bit  
**[0:34:58-0:35:14](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:34:58):**  before answering the question and obviously reflecting on, it's kind of a horrible question  because as we know, it's inevitably full of ups and downs.  And so the ability to answer that question for two reasons, one, because the way I feel  
**[0:35:14-0:35:28](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:35:14):**  about how things are going varies disproportionately from the most recent call, and second, because  it's complex, right?  Because in actual fact, to get a fundraising complete is not a linear process.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:46](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:35:28):**  And so the 17 tiles that you're trying to push up the board at the same time, it's very  hard to summarize because the end point that you're working to isn't a fixed end point.  And even the configuration of how many investors and what size and what time.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:59](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:35:46):**  And so it, it feels challenging to answer in a way that's either a succinct or unquestionably  positive, of course, there's pressure for it to sound positive and for there to be momentum  and all that good stuff.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:09](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:35:59):**  And often there is, and depending on what time of what day you asked me, I'd be like  punching there and it's all going great.  So I just, it was funny.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:25](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:36:09):**  And it was also a point of solidarity with the founder, but also the weirdness of I really  feel your answer, which is not common, right?  Like in terms of normally when we ask that question, it's absent of the context of us  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:36:25):**  being actively fundraising as well.  Yeah.  There's a sort of more distant empathy if I remember what that was like.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:47](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:36:30):**  Not yes, I know because I'm on the other side of this table in an hour and in the last hour.  Yeah, I think it also goes to the difference for a founder and for us, but for a founder,  when you're talking to someone in venture who like raised the money versus who didn't  
**[0:36:47-0:36:56](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:36:47):**  or who has raised money, who hasn't.  And there's so much pressure in this industry to be like, we closed our fund in 24 hours.  We closed our fund in two weeks.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:02](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:36:56):**  And that's just not true.  You physically cannot get the legal documents done in that much time, let alone send it  except the humans.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:11](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:37:02):**  Right.  But there's this kind of pressure and I don't know if journalists perpetuated or that's  just good sales and good, obviously momentum matters and so proof and FOMO and all those  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:37:11):**  things.  But I find it interesting that that's like the speed of raising is the thing we want  to perpetuate.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:29](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:37:17):**  And yet for a founder talking to someone at a VC firm who doesn't know what a raising  journey is actually like, it's a pretty important tool for them to be like, yep, look, this  is going to be oversubscribed.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:37:29):**  It's going really well.  It's super fast.  You better hurry up.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:44](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:37:32):**  That's such a powerful psychological tool.  And yet often not disingenuous, but it's unrelated to the value of the business.  I think that's what's frustrating is if we put the spotlight on a metric that is correlated  
**[0:37:44-0:37:57](https://tenacious.ventures/notes/shifting-from-climate-measurement-to-risk-mitigation-with-cullen-gunn-from-kilter-rural#t=0:37:44):**  to, but I wouldn't say one of the main drivers of what's going to create value.

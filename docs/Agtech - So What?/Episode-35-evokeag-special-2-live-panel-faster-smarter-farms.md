### Agtech - So What?  (Sat, 09 Mar 2019 12:21:40)
**[0:00:00-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly changing  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:00:25):**  the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting started.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:00:30):**  But there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between Ag and  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:00:35):**  AgTech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring you the  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:00:39):**  story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where Ag and Tech  
**[0:00:44-0:01:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:00:44):**  meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:01:14):**  If you're an investor, if you're a grower, if you're a researcher, government, great.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:01:43):**  Any big categories I missed? No, good. And my second survey question and then I'll let  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:01:49):**  you guys sit back and relax. I just want to get a sense from the room of where we sit  
**[0:01:53-0:02:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:01:53):**  on the kind of maturity around precision agriculture and kind of familiarity with this topic. So  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:02:00):**  on a one to three scale where three is I'm an expert, I'm using precision Ag, I'm doing  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:02:04):**  precision Ag, I'm very involved in this world. Precision Ag is sort of broad term, but bear  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:02:09):**  with me. One being really new to this world, really keen to learn what's going on and kind  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:02:14):**  of get my head around it. Two is somewhere in the middle. Make sense on the scale? So  
**[0:02:18-0:02:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:02:18):**  ones, new to this world learning. Great. Twos, make sense. Most people feel good with a two.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:02:27):**  Threes, experts, great. So a good range. Hopefully that's helpful for you guys in kind of hearing  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:02:32):**  where things sit. So I want to kick off as usual by having the panelists introduce themselves.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:02:37):**  We'll try to keep it to about 30 seconds each so we can get into the questions. We'll start  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:02:42):**  at that in general. Hi everyone. So I'm Jonah Williams. I work for the Airbus, Airbus Group  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:02:48):**  internationally, the oldest commercial satellite data provider in the world. And so a lot of  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:02:54):**  people don't know we've been operating the agriculture space across Europe for a very  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:02:57):**  long time. And we've been recently bringing that out to places like Australia where obviously  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:03:01):**  agriculture is such an integral part of everyday life here. And that's what I've been mainly  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:03:05):**  focusing in for the past five or six months in a really deep dive into how we can utilise  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:03:10):**  infrastructure that Airbus has on a global scale to better make faster, smarter farms  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:03:15):**  here in Australia work. Great. Just before you go Anastasia, I'm just going to have you  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:03:20):**  guys make sure you hold the mic close to your mouth so that everyone can hear. Can you guys  
**[0:03:23-0:03:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:03:23):**  hear in the back okay? Great. Is this good? All right. Wokey up, wokey up. Okay. My name  
**[0:03:31-0:03:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:03:31):**  is Anastasia Volkova and I'm the CEO and co-founder of Fluorosat and we deliver predictive agronomic  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:03:37):**  analytics for commodity crops. Our product Fluorosense, some of you have seen a demo  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:03:41):**  downstairs, it's an interoperable engine that integrates with farm management solutions.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:03:47):**  So where you keep your records, we go there, we add all of the rest of the data that is  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:03:52):**  like in there, weather, satellite imagery, soil maps, yield maps and most importantly  
**[0:03:57-0:04:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:03:57):**  modelling. So crop modelling to identify what is the potential of your crop and to demonstrate  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:04:05):**  whether you're a grower or an agronomist, what are the timely actions and recommendations  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:04:10):**  that we produce would be such as fertiliser application, irrigation, spraying, we would  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:04:17):**  tell you what, where and how much. So if you were looking at adding fertiliser and you  
**[0:04:23-0:04:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:04:23):**  wanted to increase the yield, it would be one problem and timing whilst if you were  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:04:30):**  increasing protein in your grain, it would be another one. Same I guess for cotton and  
**[0:04:35-0:04:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:04:35):**  yield. So yeah, that's Fluorosense on Fluorosat. So my name is Flavia Tardanardini. I'm the  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:04:43):**  co-founder and CEO of an Australian start-up called Fleet Space. At Fleet we operate a  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:04:49):**  constellation of small satellites called nano satellites for Internet of Things. So the  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:04:54):**  idea in various verticals in which agriculture is one of them to allow people to have private  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:05:00):**  networks of things connected, so thousands of things connected in a farm for example,  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:05:06):**  using a technology called LoRa. So this allows farmers to deploy soil moisture sensors, weather  
**[0:05:13-0:05:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:05:13):**  conditions, animal tracking and all have a private network to the sky.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:05:20):**  Hello my name is Martin Clough. I'm based in Switzerland. I work for Syngenta, one of  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:05:28):**  the world's leading crop protection and seeds providers and my job is head of global product  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:05:35):**  biology so my job is really to make sure that our new innovation fits as closely with the  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:05:41):**  needs of the farmer of the future as I can. I'm really interested in what farmers will  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:05:46):**  be doing five to ten years out from now. So I'm designing products to fit with the technologies  
**[0:05:52-0:05:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:05:52):**  that my panelists here are developing. It's very exciting for me.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:05:59):**  My name is Will Wells. I'm the founder of Hummingbird Technologies which I began in  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:06:05):**  the data science lab at Imperial College three years ago in London and happily with the help  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:06:11):**  of Google and Sir James Dyson and the European Space Agency and now thousands of paying customers  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:06:17):**  around the world, we've grown into become one of the best, I hope, remote sensing businesses  
**[0:06:23-0:06:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:06:23):**  for arable farmers around the world. Our focus is complex disease modelling, weed classification,  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:06:32):**  yield prediction and crop nutrition. We're very excited to be in Australia and we want  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:06:37):**  this to be our second biggest market by 2020. Great. So we're going to go back over a few  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:06:43):**  questions I had there but just a bit of housekeeping. If you guys are standing in the back and you  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:06:47):**  want to sit and aren't afraid of the front, there's a few seats up here. You're welcome  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:06:51):**  to come up. It won't be disruptive. And the second one is this is an interactive session  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:06:55):**  so in the app there's a place to submit questions and we're able to then pull them up on the  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:07:00):**  screen. If you don't want to do that then there's a microphone over there as well. And  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:07:06):**  so I'll probably ask a few questions and I imagine that you guys have lots of questions  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:07:10):**  as well so we'll have plenty of time for that. So I wanted to just, the way I think about  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:07:15):**  this and maybe it's helpful for some of the folks that were ones or twos in that survey,  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:07:18):**  there's sort of collection and there's analysis and there's decision making in a very simplified  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:07:24):**  form and obviously there's lots of other parts of the supply chain but just in that framing  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:07:28):**  can you help the audience understand kind of exactly where you guys fit so that again  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:07:34):**  for the ones and twos in the audience we can a little bit better get our heads around kind  
**[0:07:38-0:07:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:07:38):**  of how this space is working. So we might go in the reverse direction this time. Analysis.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:07:45):**  Integration with the customer in mind. So, hello, hello, hello. So, I don't, yeah, I  
**[0:07:55-0:08:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:07:55):**  think it's working. We literally, it's not working. Wait. It's working. Oh, yeah, it's  
**[0:08:03-0:08:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:08:03):**  working. Okay. So, devices connectivity. So what Fleet enables, we enable you to buy a  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:08:11):**  modem to connect thousands of things in your farm. All sort of things that you want to  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:08:17):**  connect. We don't build the things, we build the connectivity tools for you to connect  
**[0:08:23-0:08:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:08:23):**  a lot of things in your farm and have automated control of your farm. We are in decision support.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:08:31):**  So collapsing tabs so that decisions can be made on recommendations straight away. And  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:08:38):**  we launch, we build, we launch and take all the data from satellites all across the globe  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:08:45):**  and then with our latest productivity, we're actually delivering a base level of analytics  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:08:51):**  that take away that first step in giving you accurate starting points to make in field  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:08:56):**  predictions. So, Martin, I wanted to ask you from a Syngenta perspective as a business  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:09:01):**  that's been in agriculture for a long time and really working in this space, what's your  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:09:06):**  view on and why are you involved in working with these new companies, sort of startups  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:09:11):**  and the digital space? How do you see the interactions between a larger company and  
**[0:09:15-0:09:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:09:15):**  quite small ones? Okay, look, in my world I'm inventing new crop protection products.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:09:25):**  We're coming under increasing pressure from things like resistance, regulation, political  
**[0:09:32-0:09:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:09:32):**  decision making as to what we can register, where we can register them and also our user  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:09:39):**  base is becoming more diverse. So we have to develop specialist products for users who  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:09:45):**  are working in different geographies, different crops with different restrictions around them.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:09:51):**  In the future, their world is going to change also. They will have to deal with things like  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:09:56):**  precision application equipment, digital support tools, satellite and drone based platform  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:10:03):**  imagery to help them decide how and when and where to apply our products. And so we're  
**[0:10:09-0:10:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:10:09):**  designing products that are specifically suited to them so that we get the best possible value  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:10:16):**  out of our products for our customers and that we minimise impact on the environment.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:10:22):**  So it needs to get exactly on the target, not miss the target and make sure that we  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:10:27):**  don't end up with products that may contaminate the environment or cause harm. So the sustainability  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:10:33):**  piece is really important. To do all that, I need the technologies that these guys are  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:10:38):**  bringing in terms of imagery, engineering, decision support, artificial intelligence  
**[0:10:44-0:10:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:10:44):**  and machine learning.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:10:45):**  Great. And maybe, hello, yes. Jonah, do you want to comment on kind of why, and then I'll  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:10:52):**  have the start-ups give the other side, but why a company that's not traditionally been  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:10:55):**  an agriculture player is now becoming active in the ag space?  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:11:01):**  So we actually are traditionally an agriculture player, just not here. So what we've been  
**[0:11:06-0:11:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:11:06):**  doing for the past 15 years is we're the almost go-to name in France for a product we have  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:11:12):**  called Farmstar, where we worked with a local insurance and agronomy company to develop  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:11:17):**  an incredibly detailed economic service for precision agriculture. But we can't replicate  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:11:23):**  15 years worth of R&D to get that product where we are today in every country. So what  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:11:27):**  we're doing now is we're utilising what we know best. We're not agronomers, we are not  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:11:31):**  farmers, we're not any of those, but we do satellite imagery really well. We know how  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:11:35):**  to use that satellite imagery really well, and we're delivering that baseline so that  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:11:40):**  people like Anastasia can take that and go, right, I'm going to give you that yield prediction  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:11:44):**  based on that data because I know that it's accurate, I know it tells me what I need to  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:11:48):**  know, and I know I can rely on it day in, day out.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:11:52):**  Great. And that starts to touch on some of the benefits for the growers and I think along  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:11:56):**  the supply chain, which I want to come back to. But first, just for especially Anastasia  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:12:01):**  and Will, but Flavia, I want to hear as well. This space is really crowded and there's lots  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:12:05):**  of talk of IoT and of imagery and of sensors and I want to get the kind of, not the product  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:12:11):**  pitch or the company pitch on what you guys do, but how do you kind of see this space  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:12:16):**  evolving and what do you see your company's role in it as the space evolves? Is it consolidation?  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:12:21):**  Is it partnerships? And where do you see yourselves playing? I might start with you, Will.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:12:25):**  Yeah, so I think a few years ago, lots and lots of companies came to market disappointed  
**[0:12:31-0:12:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:12:31):**  with generic NDVI pretty picture products and have now either gone bust or have gone  
**[0:12:38-0:12:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:12:38):**  home with their tails between their legs. There's clear value to be had in complex solutions  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:12:44):**  that involve machine learning and imagery analytics using data from multiple sources,  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:12:50):**  whether it's hyperspectral images on a drone or whether it's satellites or whether it's  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:12:54):**  from robots. And you have to attack the value, the holy grail areas of agronomy that people  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:13:00):**  are struggling with. So it's my T2 fungicide decision junction and I don't know what product  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:13:06):**  choice to use, I don't know what timing and I don't know what rate. And it's those areas  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:13:11):**  that you should focus on. In terms of integration, we love collaborating with everyone. We work  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:13:17):**  very hard to build API connections to all existing leading software players because  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:13:22):**  farmers hate logging into more than one system. And anyone that doesn't do that is also probably  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:13:28):**  going to go bust in our opinion.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:13:30):**  Okay, Flavia?  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:13:33):**  So when it comes to Internet of Things, you know, when I founded a company, I'm an entrepreneur,  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:13:37):**  I founded a company with a vision, with a dream that, let's say Internet of Things dream,  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:13:43):**  that is just a buzzword, but the reality is what can you actually do if we keep a farm  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:13:49):**  with a lot of sensors? I mean, how can you change the way you work if a thousand things  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:13:55):**  in your farm are connected? If there are soil moisture sensors to tell you when you need  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:13:59):**  to do your water management, if all your animals are tracked, if there are water stations,  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:14:04):**  if there are valves, if people are connected, if bees are connected. You know, one of our  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:14:10):**  customers connects 80,000 beehives in California through space. It's awesome stuff. And the  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:14:16):**  farmers got 80,000 sensors each. The point is IoT and connecting all these sensors, it's  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:14:21):**  always really hard because, I mean, who has got 3G? I mean, I'm Italian and I'm a fleet  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:14:27):**  in St. Adelaide and I saw a farm in Adelaide that's as big as Belgium, right? So, oh my  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:14:33):**  God, right? You do need satellites because it's not 3G. But what I've learned in the  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:14:38):**  past couple of years that, you know, I always say you need a village to raise an IoT deployment,  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:14:44):**  is really hard, you know, because at the end of the day, what is really important is the  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:14:48):**  data. So, you give a connectivity tool, but hell, it's hard work. But what the impact  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:14:54):**  that we have seen, it's unbelievable. But you have to work with the right partners.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:14:59):**  I mean, I'm not with boots and hats in the field putting sensors. I've done it. You need  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:15:05):**  to work with system integrators. I know four in the room that we work with. These are awesome  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:15:10):**  people that literally can create that gap. You know, you talk about that gap about people  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:15:15):**  building technologies and actually farmers using it, the gap is huge. It's huge. It's  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:15:21):**  still huge. So, when you build a solution, and I was talking with someone before, you  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:15:27):**  need to bring it into the farm as fast as possible because they're going to hate it.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:15:30):**  So, you need a lot of support to make it happen. It's a very good solution.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:15:37):**  So, some of you know that FloridaSat acquired ProductionWise last year. So, it's a farm  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:15:43):**  management software example. And you also might have seen the recent announcement about  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:15:48):**  the CRCP with AgWorld. So, for us, the answer in the crowded space is actually you might  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:15:53):**  not hear the word fluorescence as a farmer or as an agronomist. You might. You might  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:15:58):**  not. But for us, what is very important is that we bring the science out of CSIRO, out  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:16:03):**  of labs of these universities, our own science, to where your data is. We're getting the imagery  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:16:09):**  from, obviously, companies like Airbus. We're getting IoT connectivity from companies like  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:16:15):**  Fleet because we want that data to live somewhere where it can inform the decision making. And  
**[0:16:21-0:16:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:16:21):**  obviously, some areas are better covered by drones, some by planes, some by satellite,  
**[0:16:28-0:16:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:16:28):**  and all of it is flowing into one system. But what ultimately is important is that you  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:16:31):**  want to know how to make the money on your farm. And you don't want to spend time looking  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:16:37):**  at the dashboards. So, for us, the crowded space answer was collaborate, collaborate,  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:16:42):**  collaborate. And we have integrated farm management systems to do it. Now, IoT imagery, obviously,  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:16:48):**  is there as well. And, yeah, it would be really interesting to take your questions later on  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:16:54):**  to what you think about this crowded space.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:16:56):**  Yeah, great. Thanks. I thought I'd add something. So, there's lots of talk about data. And it  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:17:03):**  seems on the surface that data would be useful. I think there's also lots of talk around how  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:17:07):**  data is not that useful without decisions. And we get lots of pretty pictures. And there's  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:17:12):**  lots of complaints around lots of pretty pictures that aren't really doing anything to add value.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:17:16):**  I'm seeing some heads nod. So, I want some comments. And, Joni, maybe we'll start with  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:17:20):**  you around how do we move from great sensors, great technology, yes, it's hard, yes, service  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:17:25):**  matters, but going from pretty pictures to actual decisions that kind of drive the bottom  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:17:30):**  line.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:17:31):**  Yeah, well, that's a hell of a question. You're absolutely right. Data in itself is integral.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:17:39):**  You can't do anything without the data, whether it be satellite, drone, whatever it is. It  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:17:43):**  is an intensive part. And for a long time, especially in precision agriculture, it has  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:17:48):**  always just been the pixels you rely on the person who's buying it from you, companies  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:17:53):**  like myself, to deal with that. That's been their problem. But at the end of the day now,  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:17:58):**  people want to make smarter decisions. They want to make it faster. They don't care about  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:18:01):**  where the data came from. They just care that it works. So, for us, and I guess for the  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:18:07):**  industry to respond to this, we need to be able to say, well, how can we go and cut through  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:18:12):**  all of that, because it's still necessary. You still need that data in the background.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:18:15):**  You still need that backdrop behind it to give it its validity. But we need to figure  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:18:21):**  out better ways, and we're constantly improving, to get through that faster to get to that  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:18:26):**  result. And I think that we've come so far in the past five years alone, two years alone  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:18:32):**  even in this space, that what is really fantastic now as far as a prediction will be old in  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:18:38):**  12 months. And it's accelerating at the rate that I think IT is doing, and it's incredible.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:18:43):**  It's incredibly a part of.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:18:45):**  Yeah, I think that's worth coming back to, kind of how fast this space is changing and  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:18:48):**  how to stay up to date. But, Martin, we have a question for you here from the audience.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:18:52):**  Yeah, so this is a very interesting one. I would say probably half of my time at the  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:18:57):**  moment is focusing exactly on this question. What we're trying to do is we are trying to  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:19:03):**  get a view of who are going to be the winners and the losers in the precision application,  
**[0:19:08-0:19:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:19:08):**  precision agriculture data space in five to ten years, and to make sure that the innovation  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:19:16):**  that we're developing fits with that use. It takes us over ten years to bring a new  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:19:22):**  molecule from the first idea through to a product in the market. During that time, a  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:19:28):**  lot of things can happen, so I need that ten-year foresight. What we're doing is we're actually  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:19:33):**  doing field trials. My company does around 12,000 field trials per year. That's about  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:19:39):**  $120 million in investment per year in field trials globally. That's a big global farm.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:19:45):**  We're using some of the technologies that my panelists here are talking about to actually  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:19:51):**  help us do our field trialing. We're applying these technologies to examine the incidence  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:19:57):**  of pests, disease, weeds, emergence, crop health, vigor, plant architecture in those  
**[0:20:03-0:20:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:20:03):**  trials because we know that our customers in five to ten years' time will be using exactly  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:20:09):**  those same technologies to judge how our products are working. It's extremely important that  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:20:15):**  we use these to be able to develop products that are precisely what the customer needs  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:20:21):**  and are going to be used in the way they're going to be in five to ten years' time in  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:20:25):**  terms of sustainability. Precision application might require products that have got different  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:20:31):**  formulation characteristics. They may be applied through high-speed, machine-vision guided  
**[0:20:37-0:20:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:20:37):**  application. You can't afford to have volatility, splash, vapor, or anything like that. No cross-contamination.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:20:43):**  Those are the sorts of things that we're building into our products now and selecting compounds  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:20:50):**  for that future.  
**[0:20:51-0:21:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:20:51):**  Can I add? Hummingbird does a lot of work with life sciences businesses like Martin's.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:21:00):**  Ultimately, it's not just about how their business models need to adapt. It's also about  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:21:04):**  how ours adapt to fit in with theirs because these guys have balance sheets of $50 billion  
**[0:21:09-0:21:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:21:09):**  and we have something a lot less than that. If we're producing weed classification maps  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:21:16):**  at post-emergence to help with that herbicide application and these guys have a herbicide  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:21:21):**  product and volumes are going to come down because regulatory requirements insist that  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:21:26):**  they do, why not work together and target the areas that need the most chemistry so  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:21:31):**  that you don't? You're also tackling problems like resistance that we've mentioned there.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:21:35):**  There is an equal harmonious balance that can be achieved.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:21:39):**  Can I just add something to that?  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:21:42):**  One of the things we're grappling with at the moment is speed and scale. I mentioned  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:21:46):**  we've got a global farming operation. That means that the data needs to be of the right  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:21:52):**  quality. The metadata needs to be correct. We need to be collecting the right data globally  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:21:58):**  and analyzing it and using it in a consistent way. That scalability isn't quite here yet  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:22:04):**  and the speed isn't either. Some of the technologies we're looking at around machine vision, AI  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:22:09):**  and so on, it requires a lot of time, a lot of computing power. Things get in the way  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:22:15):**  like weather, clouds stop your drones gathering data. They're not much good for satellites  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:22:21):**  either. The practicalities sometimes get in the way of the cool digital science.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:22:27):**  Yeah, great. I want to just invite anyone who does have a question in addition to the  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:22:31):**  app, if you want to get up, feel free to start asking them now if you want. We don't need  
**[0:22:35-0:22:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:22:35):**  to wait until the end. You mentioned before value. I wanted to ask about in this world  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:22:42):**  where we have all this data being collected and analyzed, who pays for it and how do we  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:22:48):**  think about where the value is created and who's actually paying for that. Is it somewhere  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:22:53):**  in the channel? Is it on the input side? Is it at the collection side? What does the supply  
**[0:22:58-0:23:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:22:58):**  chain look like in terms of where the value is and who's actually paying along the supply  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:23:05):**  chain? I might start actually with Anastasia on this one. Put you on the spot before, Jonah.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:23:10):**  Yeah, that was a bit unexpected. Okay, so who's paying the supply chain? It's a question  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:23:14):**  that I think worries everybody who's a farmer here, right? Am I going to pay for this? Is  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:23:19):**  my agronomist going to pay for this and charge me? Is the input company going to pay for  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:23:23):**  this? The way we are seeing, I'll actually dovetail this answer into Martin's because  
**[0:23:29-0:23:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:23:29):**  companies like Syngenta, they're massive in this space. Nutrient companies that are producing  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:23:36):**  nutrient, chemicals, spray, irrigation equipment are the companies that have most money in  
**[0:23:41-0:23:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:23:41):**  the space and it's a necessary evil, how farmers call it, right? There's no way we can do farming  
**[0:23:48-0:23:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:23:48):**  without those inputs and it's a logical place for the most money to be made and most money  
**[0:23:56-0:24:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:23:56):**  to be paid. So in our vision of the supply chain, this is where agricultural technology  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:24:03):**  is to pay for itself because what we found is that someone who is an agronomist or a  
**[0:24:07-0:24:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:24:07):**  farmer often comes across us using production-wise fluorescence and what they want the agronomist  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:24:14):**  to use it for is to be accountable for the product that they are taking from the shed  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:24:20):**  to their farm, what they're selling to that farmer, what they're selling to individual  
**[0:24:24-0:24:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:24:24):**  growers. So we found that that was a pretty good way of explaining, first of all, but  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:24:32):**  also actually legitimising the analytics because the scientific model cannot tell you, depending  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:24:39):**  on your balance sheet or depending on your opinion of the CEO of a big company, to use  
**[0:24:45-0:24:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:24:45):**  less or more chemical or nutrition on that farm. It'll just tell how much it needs and  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:24:52):**  this is where analytics, I think, is the future because if those who are currently getting  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:24:58):**  most of the money out of the system are going to pay for legitimising their existing seeds,  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:25:04):**  in a way, better for the grower and better for the whole supply chain.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:25:07):**  Did you want to comment?  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:25:10):**  This is quite a novel thought in this arena, but something we're seeing in the US, which  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:25:16):**  is very interesting, is profit sharing. Now, it takes years to develop machine learning  
**[0:25:22-0:25:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:25:22):**  based solutions that can reliably and consistently give an ROI on farm, but for us, we did 30,000  
**[0:25:30-0:25:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:25:30):**  flights on winter canopy management of canola in Europe last year and we saw a pretty robust  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:25:37):**  return on investment to the point that we're now putting ourselves on the block saying,  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:25:41):**  actually, we'll go 50-50 on any profits you share. So in that case, we're happy to pay  
**[0:25:47-0:25:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:25:47):**  for it.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:25:48):**  The reality is it does take years to develop and where the ROI is during the developmental  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:25:53):**  cycle is very much up for debate.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:25:58):**  I wanted to see if there's anyone in the audience on the producer side, on the grower side,  
**[0:26:03-0:26:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:26:03):**  who might have a comment. I know that this is a hot topic and so I imagine some of you  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:26:06):**  have opinions. Does anyone want to share a comment or question?  
**[0:26:09-0:26:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:26:09):**  No? Yes, please. Do you mind using – there's a mic just there. You might have to walk over,  
**[0:26:16-0:26:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:26:16):**  sorry.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:26:17):**  I work for a sovereign wealth fund out of the Middle East and I just think this is probably  
**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:26:26):**  the moment I've been waiting for. So, Will, are you telling me that I can have agronomists  
**[0:26:32-0:26:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:26:32):**  in the future ground truthing and actually providing some sort of support in terms of  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:26:39):**  what products, but the concept of having somebody pulled out because there's a meeting tomorrow  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:26:44):**  and they'll look at the potatoes on Friday and get there and it's too late, will go?  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:26:49):**  Absolutely, William, and we hope to be doing it on all of your farms in the Ukraine this  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:26:53):**  season.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:26:54):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:26:55):**  I think that was a bit of a layup.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:27:01):**  Great. So, I think the value for the user is really where I wanted to go next and I  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:27:07):**  think it's about consumers too. We talk about better, faster, smarter farms and 100% has  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:27:11):**  to be valuable for the farmer, but what are the benefits even down the supply chain of  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:27:16):**  making these changes upstream?  
**[0:27:18-0:27:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:27:18):**  When I started my journey, I got fascinated about a story because I think bringing value  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:27:26):**  is also about great stories. There was a farm in California, it was probably five years  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:27:32):**  ago, that decided it was a winery and California has got a similar issue to Australia in terms  
**[0:27:36-0:27:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:27:36):**  of drought and heat and stuff like that and that decided to keep a farm with a lot of  
**[0:27:42-0:27:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:27:42):**  sensors in one season to measure leaf content and water. Very similar probably to Australia,  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:27:49):**  you know, when you go to a drought season, then there is a black market, so you just  
**[0:27:52-0:27:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:27:52):**  don't lose the money on your farm. On top of that, you have to pay for water. It's a  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:27:59):**  very complicated process and I come from South Australia where it's so hot and dry and it's  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:28:05):**  a big topic.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:28:06):**  So, this California farm decided to keep the entire winery with IoT and in 12 months, while  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:28:13):**  all the neighbourhood was struggling with a massive heatwave and everything went totally  
**[0:28:18-0:28:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:28:18):**  downhill, these guys really triplicated their wine production and it was the best year and  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:28:26):**  it was a massive story. They changed to California. After that, California started the adoption  
**[0:28:31-0:28:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:28:31):**  of IoT with mistakes and errors and so forth, but very aggressively and I loved it. There  
**[0:28:38-0:28:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:28:38):**  is the power of stories that can demonstrate value really, really fast of people that start  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:28:46):**  adopting technology fast. They demonstrate how they save, sometimes save, you know. Last  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:28:52):**  year in Australia, there was the big and the opposite, you know, the cold and US have a  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:28:58):**  similar story. An IoT equipment farm that went through an absolute, everything froze  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:29:04):**  around it. They knew it in time because IoT. So, there are some stories out there that  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:29:09):**  can show the value very, very fast. We don't have to wait 20 years to understand if they  
**[0:29:14-0:29:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:29:14):**  have saved money or they have increased revenue per year. There are some debt. In farming,  
**[0:29:21-0:29:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:29:21):**  there are some events that can kill the production and these events can be prevented with technologies.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:29:29):**  They can be prevented. So, it's not a matter of what do you do, how well do you do if you  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:29:35):**  do these technologies. It's how bad if you don't. And this is what I've learned in the  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:29:39):**  past couple of years with the story I've seen and this is why US have a keep that most of  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:29:44):**  the farms are IoT keep and they're going really fast. So, don't underestimate that. There  
**[0:29:49-0:29:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:29:49):**  are some big issue that we still don't tackle. Yes, Anastasia, did you want to comment? Yes,  
**[0:29:57-0:30:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:29:57):**  just for producers and agronomists in the audience, we are interested in this vision  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:30:04):**  of the data is your new oil, right? So, I am really challenging each of you today to  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:30:09):**  think how you're accessing that resource, how you're making sure that your farm is connected,  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:30:15):**  that you're keeping records on your farm, that you will have a data set to look at because  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:30:20):**  this is where the more efficiency, the less arable land will come. And we see the future  
**[0:30:26-0:30:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:30:26):**  in which that data is your commodity and everybody who wants to sell something to producer, you  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:30:33):**  will have that commodity to trade, not simply your land, you will have that data and that  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:30:39):**  is something that you should definitely consider because that data can obviously be used against  
**[0:30:43-0:30:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:30:43):**  you and you definitely don't want big multinational corporations to do anything bad with it unless  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:30:51):**  you control it. So, that's something that I wanted to add in terms of the value for  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:30:55):**  the producer. Your value will be in your data. Connect the farms today, get those images,  
**[0:31:00-0:31:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:31:00):**  get those IoT sensors, you will figure out how to farm better with the connected farm.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:31:04):**  Great, thanks. Any questions from the audience? So, Martin, I – oh, one from – there you  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:31:14):**  go, that's for you, Will. So, this is when can I see the cost of hyperspectral sensors  
**[0:31:20-0:31:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:31:20):**  reducing? I mean, we wish that it happened faster than it is. The reality is we will  
**[0:31:28-0:31:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:31:28):**  be doing paid hyperspectral work, particularly looking at disease and spectral signatures  
**[0:31:35-0:31:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:31:35):**  of individual weeds or diseases at different growth stages. If you put that on a plane  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:31:42):**  and you've got a big enough area, you can just about make it work on a sort of dollar  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:31:46):**  per hectare basis, but it is still very much in the domain of the sort of work that Dr.  
**[0:31:52-0:32:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:31:52):**  Clough does and we work on lots of those trials. I would say 18 months as an actual answer,  
**[0:32:00-0:32:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:32:00):**  but it's coming. So, from our perspective, saddle up, develop the algorithms, use it  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:32:06):**  to inform what you're doing now because when it arrives, it's very exciting for the  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:32:11):**  whole industry because there's a lot more value that can be added. Charles, you came  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:32:16):**  up earlier and asked a question and I'm not sure where you are in the audience, but  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:32:22):**  you can look up the hyperspectral over crops in Australia now today. It's accessible.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:32:27):**  It's something that Florsat provides and specialty crops get it from us. We have produced  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:32:34):**  science based on it and it's something that I don't think a grower or an agronomist  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:32:38):**  needs to have that sensor. We're obviously waiting for the satellites in the orbit to  
**[0:32:42-0:32:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:32:42):**  have it so that we will all have it soon. Hopefully they'll place it in the orbit  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:32:50):**  for us. With those expensive data sources, I would say that the science is out there.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:32:56):**  It's done. There are services available to you. It's definitely not something that's  
**[0:33:00-0:33:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:33:00):**  as cost effective as for dryland farming, but you're trying not to do weeds on green  
**[0:33:06-0:33:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:33:06):**  on green in dryland farming. You're trying to do weeds in fallow. This is something that  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:33:09):**  you can do with even simple NDVI pictures from very high resolution pictures from Airbus  
**[0:33:15-0:33:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:33:15):**  satellites.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:33:16):**  Did you have something to add, Martin? No? Okay. I thought you were going for it. Martin,  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:33:23):**  you mentioned before trying to pick winners and to figure out who in this space to work  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:33:28):**  with. One of the other areas where it's interesting to think about picking winners  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:33:33):**  is in the collection space. Drones adding value right now, are they going to be around  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:33:39):**  in the future? Are we going to have crazy satellite resolution and that's going to  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:33:42):**  rule the world? Are we still using fixed wing? How do you, and I'll start with you and Jonah  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:33:47):**  maybe ask you as well, how do you see the collection space evolving and from a Syngenta  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:33:51):**  perspective, how much does that matter?  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:33:53):**  So at the moment, from an R&D perspective, we can only get the resolution that we need  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:33:59):**  through a drone based platform. Commercially, we can get the resolution we need through  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:34:03):**  a satellite based platform. It depends whether you're looking at field level or whether  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:34:08):**  you're looking at plot level. I'm looking at plot level most of the time because I'm  
**[0:34:11-0:34:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:34:11):**  inventing new products. I think the technology either exists or will exist very soon to get  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:34:18):**  the definition that we need from satellite platforms. Unfortunately, the best technology  
**[0:34:23-0:34:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:34:23):**  tends to be limited to the defence sector, which means that then there's the question  
**[0:34:31-0:34:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:34:31):**  of when it will become available outside the defence sector to agriculture. There's a  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:34:36):**  longer term vision that says that this sort of data will become very valuable to governments  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:34:41):**  to protect food security. When we get up to that sort of level, then I think we have the  
**[0:34:46-0:34:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:34:46):**  leverage to get into the very highest level of resolution that we can get from a satellite  
**[0:34:52-0:34:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:34:52):**  imagery when governments are actually supporting decisions on how to farm, when to farm, which  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:34:58):**  crops to farm and when to make decisions. Now that's a long term view. That may be 10,  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:35:04):**  20, 30 years out. You might think it's quite scary. It'll probably happen.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:35:09):**  Interesting. Jonah, similar to front view?  
**[0:35:13-0:35:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:35:13):**  I think from a data point of view, we've got a new constellation coming out in 2020 and  
**[0:35:21-0:35:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:35:21):**  then 2022. Four new satellites, it'll be 30 centimetre. I know Digital Globe has got their  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:35:25):**  legion constellation coming out sometime soon. Planet is throwing up more birds than I can  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:35:29):**  keep track of. These are just three main providers that are throwing up a hell of a lot of birds.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:35:35):**  They're putting things in space to try and give more data. I think we need to come back  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:35:41):**  to the point of you have to have the right sensor for the right job. We have so much  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:35:47):**  data getting flooded to farmers, producers, to agronomists, to everyone at the moment  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:35:51):**  across the board from an analytical point of view that I think a lot of people are overwhelmed  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:35:55):**  by. I'm just going to stick to what I know. I've used Landsat before. It's done enough.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:36:00):**  Okay, I'll stick with that. But there's so much data coming through that does resolution  
**[0:36:06-0:36:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:36:06):**  necessarily mean a better product? Do we have a variable rate applicator that can actually  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:36:13):**  apply at 30 centimetre resolution? Okay. So in that case, how valuable is it spending  
**[0:36:19-0:36:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:36:19):**  $30 a square kilometre on 30 centimetre resolution, if that was the case, to get that? At the  
**[0:36:26-0:36:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:36:26):**  end of the day, you have to think what is going to be best for the farmer? What is it  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:36:29):**  going to be best for when it comes down to what can they actually use? Yes, it looks  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:36:33):**  really pretty. But it's about meaningful results from the data that you collect. So the sensors  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:36:38):**  are important and there's going to be a hell of a lot more coming but it's about getting  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:36:41):**  useful quantification from the data that's being provided. If I could just add to that.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:36:46):**  So Joni, you're absolutely right that the farmer can't actually apply at that level  
**[0:36:51-0:36:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:36:51):**  of resolution. However, many of the pests and diseases that we're looking at can only  
**[0:36:58-0:37:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:36:58):**  be detected at that level of resolution. And that is the problem. So the detection and  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:37:04):**  the application are decoupled. So we've done quite a lot of work with industry leaders.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:37:09):**  We've worked with Blue River Technologies, Precision Hawk, Gamaia. We did some very good  
**[0:37:15-0:37:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:37:15):**  work with drone-based platforms last year. We even hung LIDAR sensors as well as hyperspectral  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:37:22):**  and visual wavelength sensors under some of these drones last year to see what could we  
**[0:37:27-0:37:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:37:27):**  possibly get in terms of insight for very difficult to detect diseases. And all of these  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:37:34):**  sensors still struggle. So you can detect things like Asian soybean rust which defoliates  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:37:39):**  your crop. You can detect late blight. But when it starts getting into trickier things,  
**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:37:44):**  some of the serial diseases, for example, you really do have to be very clever with  
**[0:37:50-0:37:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:37:50):**  your sensors.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:37:51):**  Can I add something as well very, very fast? Something I've seen in the IoT space that  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:37:57):**  is different just for everyone understanding. One thing is taking a photo from the top.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:38:02):**  Right? This is what these guys are talking about. One thing is getting another from a  
**[0:38:06-0:38:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:38:06):**  sensor in the soil. It's a different exercise. And you need both. You do need both. But what  
**[0:38:14-0:38:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:38:14):**  I've learned in the past two years, probably I expect it, but when a farmer has a soil  
**[0:38:22-0:38:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:38:22):**  moisture sensor, they can sit. They control it. They know what part of the area it is.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:38:28):**  They get the data. There are probably 25 quite trusted things. So they have got a tendency  
**[0:38:34-0:38:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:38:34):**  to deploy ground sensors much easily. And this is what we are seeing. The problem is  
**[0:38:41-0:38:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:38:41):**  that all the sensors on the ground, so not in the sky, on the ground, soil moisture sensors,  
**[0:38:47-0:38:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:38:47):**  leaf content, water, they are also different. Some of them, they give you so much data.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:38:53):**  Some of them, they just give you little data. So the point is what you want to do with them.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:38:59):**  Just really quickly, because then we have a couple of audience questions.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:39:01):**  Really quickly, try and always remember the goalposts are moving. So we're working at  
**[0:39:05-0:39:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:39:05):**  integrating synthetic aperture radar satellites which penetrate cloud cover. So that deletes  
**[0:39:11-0:39:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:39:11):**  a lot of the problems. Beyond visual line of sight, drone permissioning changes everything  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:39:17):**  because you can have whole swarms of drones that don't need a pilot and can go and inspect  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:39:22):**  and potentially even spot spray items. This technology exists and it works. It's just  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:39:28):**  a matter of deregulation and cost.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:39:31):**  Great. Thanks. Yes, lots we could get into there. We will run out of time if we try though.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:39:37):**  So question from the audience.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:39:39):**  Yeah. My name is David Campbell, known to some of the people in this room. I've been  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:39:44):**  around Australian agriculture and agribusiness as well as globally over the last 40 years  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:39:49):**  or so. I want to pick up on Martin's comment about security and I agree that in future  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:39:54):**  governments will certainly be using this to make some informed decisions about resource  
**[0:39:59-0:40:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:39:59):**  management. I want to I guess look at the other aspect of security. So it's about 25  
**[0:40:06-0:40:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:40:06):**  years ago when I was in pivot we were the first organisation to do yield mapping in  
**[0:40:10-0:40:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:40:10):**  Australia and to take decision support systems out on farm with farmers. We had a lot of  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:40:16):**  opportunity and it's fantastic to see the technology here 20 to 25 years later. There  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:40:21):**  were things we talked about then but the enabling technology platforms just weren't there.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:40:26):**  What I think impacted what we were trying to do was what I would call very destructive  
**[0:40:30-0:40:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:40:30):**  competition in the marketplace where people compete for the farmer and compete for their  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:40:36):**  information and their data and any of us who have been through that commercially see how  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:40:41):**  destructive that can be. I worked in Monsanto in the 80s. In the early 80s we were offered  
**[0:40:47-0:40:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:40:47):**  Landsat imaging here in Melbourne to look at the Australian crop market and it was fantastic.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:40:53):**  There was only one problem. We didn't know how to use it. We didn't know how to read  
**[0:40:57-0:41:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:40:57):**  it. We didn't even have PCs on our desk and I thought wow, wouldn't it be great to do  
**[0:41:03-0:41:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:41:03):**  that. 15 years later I was in Cargill's headquarters in Wysata just outside Minneapolis in Minnesota.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:41:13):**  They showed me their global constellation of satellites and their system they use to  
**[0:41:16-0:41:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:41:16):**  monitor what goes on around the world because it affects their agribusiness trading position.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:41:21):**  I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude but can you ask the question?  
**[0:41:24-0:41:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:41:24):**  No, so my question is I'm getting to the question because here's some examples of what really  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:41:27):**  happens out there. The Australian Wheat Board by the way developed something very similar  
**[0:41:32-0:41:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:41:32):**  which became part of their intellectual property and I guess that's back with Cargill now anyway  
**[0:41:38-0:41:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:41:38):**  because they wound up buying the grain trading. What happens when we see the impact of destructive  
**[0:41:44-0:41:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:41:44):**  competition, Australia is a small country globally, what happens when people play nasty?  
**[0:41:50-0:41:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:41:50):**  What happens when your operations in the Ukraine decide they want to shut us out of our global  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:41:57):**  market in Asia for wheat which is starting to happen out of the Black Sea? What happens  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:42:02):**  and how do we overcome that happening as we develop the technology? It's not an easy question  
**[0:42:07-0:42:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:42:07):**  to answer I know but what do we have to think about? We just had our House of Reps in Canberra  
**[0:42:12-0:42:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:42:12):**  hacked this week. What are some of the things we have to take on board? I don't expect you  
**[0:42:17-0:42:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:42:17):**  to answer this question fully though. Good. Thank you for the question because data security,  
**[0:42:28-0:42:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:42:28):**  competition and the quality of that competition is extremely important. Without competition  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:42:34):**  you won't have innovation. None of us will be sitting up here without competition. Competition  
**[0:42:39-0:42:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:42:39):**  is a really good thing. Respect for data, how you actually manage it, how you look after  
**[0:42:47-0:42:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:42:47):**  it, how you safeguard the owners of those data, that is really important. I can't guarantee  
**[0:42:54-0:43:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:42:54):**  that data isn't going to get hacked, used, misused or whatever. If I did I'd be lying  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:43:00):**  because pretty much every industry does that and has had that happen to them. Everyone's  
**[0:43:06-0:43:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:43:06):**  been hacked and spammed in the audience I imagine. What we need to make sure of though  
**[0:43:13-0:43:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:43:13):**  is that our data management platforms are as secure as they can be. Actually having  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:43:20):**  high quality data management platforms for what we're talking about is probably one of  
**[0:43:25-0:43:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:43:25):**  the trickiest things that we're facing at the moment. I don't have that in Syngenta  
**[0:43:31-0:43:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:43:31):**  globally. I don't know if anyone in the audience does have a really high quality secure data  
**[0:43:38-0:43:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:43:38):**  management platform. I wish there was someone sat on this panel who was able to talk about  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:43:44):**  the quality and security of data management platforms. For me that is a bit that is currently  
**[0:43:48-0:43:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:43:48):**  missing. But I take your point about the importance. Is it more than just technology as well? Is  
**[0:43:56-0:44:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:43:56):**  it some sort of understanding between the participants and the players? So he said was  
**[0:44:02-0:44:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:44:02):**  there something else beyond the technology? Something about is there anything to do between  
**[0:44:06-0:44:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:44:06):**  the participants and the players? In terms of ethics and morality, I know my company  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:44:14):**  has a very high standard of ethics in what we do and how we do our business. I can't  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:44:19):**  vouch for everybody. The world has got all sorts of companies with all sorts of players  
**[0:44:24-0:44:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:44:24):**  in it. It's quite a complex question because real machine learning requires large high  
**[0:44:31-0:44:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:44:31):**  quality data sets. If you really want to crack disease in a certain crop, you've got to get  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:44:39):**  everyone together and combine data sets and then we've all done it. You have multiple  
**[0:44:44-0:44:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:44:44):**  sort of ironies weaved into this black box data privacy problem. I don't think it's unique  
**[0:44:51-0:44:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:44:51):**  to this industry. But just to respond to your how do we defend Australia question, I think  
**[0:44:57-0:45:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:44:57):**  that all of us are trying to help grow is here, produce more for less and be more sustainable.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:45:03):**  I think that encouraging that industry will go a long way into alleviating some of your  
**[0:45:09-0:45:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:45:09):**  concerns. Great. So we're nearly out of time. We're going to run out of time here. So I  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:45:15):**  might just hold responses on that one. So in the last sort of 20, 30 seconds here, and  
**[0:45:21-0:45:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:45:21):**  there's so much we could have gone into and I apologise that we didn't get to dig as deep  
**[0:45:24-0:45:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:45:24):**  as I'm sure you all would like. But I want just one sentence from each of you on an issue  
**[0:45:29-0:45:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:45:29):**  that lots of growers and others in this space face, which is how do I know what I should  
**[0:45:35-0:45:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:45:35):**  use and sort of where do I start? So it's very confusing. There's lots of stuff out  
**[0:45:39-0:45:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:45:39):**  there. Lots of things seem really similar. So if you're sitting in this audience wondering,  
**[0:45:44-0:45:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:45:44):**  where do I get started on this space? What advice would you guys have? There's no clear  
**[0:45:50-0:45:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:45:50):**  answer on what you should use because it's going to be different depending on what you're  
**[0:45:52-0:45:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:45:52):**  doing and how you want to do it. Farming is still a very personal farmer to farmer differentiation.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:45:58):**  But ask us the question. Talk to us about how you want to actually do things. Does it  
**[0:46:02-0:46:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:46:02):**  fit? Do you feel it fits? Try it. If it doesn't work, you can try something else. There's  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:46:06):**  so many ways to go about it, but you'll find one that actually works and will end up saving  
**[0:46:11-0:46:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:46:11):**  you a lot of money, a lot of time and probably give you better results. That is a long sentence.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:46:19):**  I would agree with Jonah. Go and talk to everybody and work out how to do it. And data should  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:46:24):**  be yours and you should be moving it around. If you have started with one and it didn't  
**[0:46:28-0:46:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:46:28):**  work, move it to the other one. If you're thinking to do into IoT and keep it farm or  
**[0:46:33-0:46:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:46:33):**  anything with sensors, just talk to me. There are five system integrators that can DJ and  
**[0:46:40-0:46:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:46:40):**  transform your company tomorrow that I will direct you to. That's practical answer.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:46:48):**  My advice would be buy the products from the person that really listens to you, really  
**[0:46:53-0:46:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:46:53):**  listens to you because it's them that are going to be innovating on behalf of your needs  
**[0:46:58-0:47:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:46:58):**  in the future. Be progressive, but ask for case studies.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:47:04):**  Great. Thank you all so much. Before we thank the panelists, I just wanted to reflect one  
**[0:47:09-0:47:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:47:09):**  insight that I think is really important to tease out here in summary is that this is  
**[0:47:13-0:47:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:47:13):**  a complicated, confusing and rapidly evolving space. Lots to stay track of, to keep on track  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:47:18):**  of, but this kind of comment of how do we think about it's a moving target and skating  
**[0:47:23-0:47:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:47:23):**  where the puck is going. So different advice depending on where you sit on the spectrum,  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:47:29):**  but it is a moving and evolving space. So if it's confusing, that's probably pretty  
**[0:47:33-0:47:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:47:33):**  true and hopefully it shakes out, but you're not alone in that confusion. So please join  
**[0:47:37-0:47:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:47:37):**  me in thanking the panelists. Thanks.  
**[0:47:38-0:48:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357325#t=0:47:38):**  Thank you for joining us on another episode of Ag Tech So What. You can stay up to date

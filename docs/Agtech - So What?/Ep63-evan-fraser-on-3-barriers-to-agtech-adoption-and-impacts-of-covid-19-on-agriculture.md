### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 19:31:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome back to Ag Tech So What, brought to you by Agfentech.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:07):**  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:10):**  Today's guest is coming to us all the way from Canada.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:13):**  Evan Frazier joins me to talk first about ag tech adoption and three big barriers we  
**[0:00:19-0:00:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:19):**  need to overcome.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:21):**  And second, something many of you are probably wondering about, how will COVID-19 impact  
**[0:00:27-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:27):**  food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:30-0:00:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:30):**  All good superheroes have their origin stories.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:32):**  In ag, it's often how we got hooked on this industry.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:36):**  Evan starts out with his.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:38):**  My origin story starts on my grandfather's fruit farm in Niagara.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:43):**  And I was probably 17 or 18 years old.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:45):**  And I remember the day very clearly.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:47):**  And my grandmother was actually a stockbroker.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:49):**  And so a female stockbroker married to a male farmer was anomalous enough at the time.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:55):**  This is the 1980s.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:00:56):**  And I remember Gran's Lincoln town car sliding into the driveway and the power window coming  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:01:02):**  down and the puff of air conditioned atmosphere coming out.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:01:05):**  And I've spent the entire day on my hands and knees pulling weeds out of the strawberry  
**[0:01:09-0:01:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:01:09):**  patch.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:01:10):**  And my grandmother and I exchanged pleasantries for a few minutes and said hello and whatnot.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:01:16):**  And it quickly became clear that she had made more money on commission from her client's  
**[0:01:21-0:01:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:01:21):**  investment portfolios that afternoon than I was going to make producing food all summer.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:01:29):**  And a couple of key conclusions sprung into my mind at that moment.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:01:34):**  The first of all is, wow, the world's a weird place when being a stockbroker is so much  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:01:40):**  more valuable to society and renumerate of the society than producing food.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:01:44):**  And I never want to be a farmer myself.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:01:49):**  It's a way to write about farming and talk about it, that it is to actually trying to  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:01:53):**  make a living off of a fruit and vegetable farm in the Niagara Peninsula.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:01:58):**  From there, Evan was sold on food and agriculture.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:02:01):**  But his path to where he is now had a few twists and turns across a couple of different  
**[0:02:06-0:02:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:02:06):**  industries along the way.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:02:08):**  Yeah, well, you know, to be honest, it didn't take any time for me to be fully into the  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:02:12):**  space because that was the common denominator ever since being a teenager, you know, spending  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:02:17):**  summers as a teenager with grandpa on the farm.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:02:20):**  Food and ag has always been my passion, although how I've come at it has changed a lot over  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:02:26):**  my career.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:02:27):**  So I actually have an undergraduate degree in anthropology, Celtic studies and religion.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:02:32):**  And then and my fourth year thesis was all about the Irish potato famine and why a quarter  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:02:36):**  of a million people are sort of a quarter of Ireland's population, about two to four  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:02:39):**  million people were either died or displaced because one crop failed.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:02:43):**  I then did work on have a master's degree in forestry.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:02:46):**  I've got a PhD in agriculture.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:02:48):**  My first postdoc right after my agriculture degree, I did a postdoc in a basically international  
**[0:02:55-0:02:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:02:55):**  relations division working for cabinet ministers.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:02:58):**  It was essentially a policy think tank.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:03:01):**  And then I got a job with an atmospheric chemistry group talking about climate change in England.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:03:06):**  And now I'm directing a interdisciplinary institute focused on the future of food called  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:03:10):**  the Aerofood Institute at the University of Guelph in Canada.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:03:14):**  Evan is doing some really cool stuff at the Aerofood Institute.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:03:17):**  He supervised dozens of grad students on everything from food riots to climate smart agriculture  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:03:23):**  to the role of supermarkets in alternative protein consumption.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:03:27):**  He's the author of two books and the creator of a card game on the food system.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:03:31):**  And he's produced a series of animated videos on agriculture that have been viewed over  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:03:36):**  half a million times.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:03:38):**  All of these, of course, are linked in the show notes.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:03:40):**  So Evan knows a lot about what's happening in the world and is excited about the potential  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:03:45):**  of ag tech.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:03:47):**  Well, if we look at the 21st century with the various challenges that we face, population  
**[0:03:53-0:04:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:03:53):**  growth, climate change, the spread of infectious diseases, diabetes and obesity, a large number  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:04:00):**  of those in some ways track back or trace back to food and the food systems that we  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:04:06):**  depend on for life.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:04:08):**  And I firmly believe that solving the challenge of global food security for the 21st century  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:04:13):**  is one of the critical challenges that history and the history books of this century will  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:04:18):**  have significant chapters written about food and food systems.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:04:23):**  Within that challenge, though, comes what is arguably one of the most incredible opportunities  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:04:27):**  facing the planet.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:04:29):**  And that is that we have novel technologies which go from genomic technologies all the  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:04:35):**  way through to big data and artificial intelligence.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:04:38):**  We have a flood of capital moving into the sector with interest as an investment opportunity.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:04:43):**  We have a focusing of government agendas on food as something that can deliver economic  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:04:49):**  benefit, but also serve up a pathway towards achieving the sustainable development goals.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:04:53):**  So I think we face this extraordinary opportunity as well by deploying technology, by investing  
**[0:05:00-0:05:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:00):**  in people, by working with farmers, by establishing policy and regulatory frameworks to actually  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:07):**  generate a tremendous amount of public and economic good at the same time as solving  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:11):**  one of the greatest sustainability and public health challenges we face.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:15):**  But despite this potential, there's still a lot of hype out there about ag tech.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:20):**  Just a couple weeks ago, I ran a workshop with a group of Nuffield scholars from all  
**[0:05:23-0:05:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:23):**  around the world.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:24):**  And when I asked them to vote on whether ag tech is hype or reality, I'd say still about  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:30):**  40% voted for hype.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:32):**  I asked Evan what he's seeing in his work.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:35):**  So starting at the super macro perspective, I don't think it's hype.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:39):**  I think it's real.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:40):**  The demand for food is rising.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:42):**  The need to change food systems is very, very evident.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:45):**  And to a large extent, agriculture is, as a sector of the economy, undercapitalized  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:49):**  and underinvested in for the last 20 or 30 or 40 years.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:53):**  So there is an opportunity for, so at a macro level, what we've got is a part of the economy  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:05:58):**  for which there's demand for the product.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:00):**  And there hasn't been a lot of investment at a global compared with other sectors in  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:04):**  the economy.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:05):**  So we should be able to put money in technology, in agriculture, and realize some significant  
**[0:06:10-0:06:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:10):**  gains.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:11):**  But really at that macro level, that's not where farmers benefit or there's a decent  
**[0:06:16-0:06:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:16):**  return on investment.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:17):**  What you have to get to is what the barriers and the bottlenecks are.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:21):**  There are three big barriers to ag tech adoption that Evan sees for the developed world.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:26):**  One, data interoperability.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:28):**  Two, data governance.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:31):**  And three, cybersecurity.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:33):**  So the three things that I think need to be worked on with significant urgency to realize  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:37):**  ag technology is one, data interoperability.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:41):**  And we need our data that is driving this new digital food economy to be sitting together  
**[0:06:47-0:06:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:47):**  and playing nice.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:48):**  And that is an enormous challenge.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:50):**  As anyone that's tried to figure out how to get a smart home to work and your phone to  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:55):**  work with your refrigerator, to work with your TV, to work with your coffee maker, I  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:06:58):**  mean, and your thermostat and your light switches and stuff.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:01):**  That is, it is so difficult to get that sort of Internet of Things technology to actually  
**[0:07:07-0:07:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:07):**  work as promised.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:09):**  And that often results in a data interoperability problem.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:12):**  So there's a tremendous amount of challenges on the area of data interoperability.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:17):**  Second, we've really got to be thinking about data governance.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:20):**  Who owns data?  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:21):**  How do we secure privacy?  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:22):**  How do we maintain anonymity?  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:24):**  How do we give farmers a share in the benefits of data?  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:27):**  And until we figure out the data governance questions, the digital agricultural revolution  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:31):**  will forever remain a mirage.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:35):**  And the third area is that I think we need to work on hard is cybersecurity.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:40):**  And I just I get terrified by the prospect of cyber criminals hacking into, say, a poultry  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:46):**  barn and turning off the ventilation system and holding the ventilation system as ransom  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:50):**  for Bitcoin.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:52):**  Holding a farm ransom for Bitcoin might seem a bit outrageous.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:07:56):**  But Evan's concerns here come from good examples in other industries.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:00):**  Well, I started thinking about this almost two years ago when doctors and nurses across  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:04):**  England went into their offices in the national health system two years ago and sat down at  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:09):**  the terminals to pull up patient health files.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:11):**  And they'd been attacked overnight by a piece of ransomware called WannaCry.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:15):**  And these cyber criminals were holding patient records hostage to ransom for the national  
**[0:08:19-0:08:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:19):**  health system.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:20):**  And that tied the national health system up or shut it down for for some number of days.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:24):**  Well, a poultry farmer with a ventilation on their barn can't shut themselves down for  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:29):**  a few days or a farmer, a dairy farmer with a robotic milker can't can't go dormant for  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:33):**  even 12 or 24 hours.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:35):**  Those cows need to be milked on a schedule.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:38):**  So I think there's tremendous cybersecurity threats that we're opening ourselves up to.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:42):**  So if we think about this, the digital agricultural revolution, we've got to work on the data  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:45):**  interoperability, the cybersecurity and the data management governance, or it will remain  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:50):**  in hype world.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:52):**  You're speaking the language of many of the farmers that I believe listen to this podcast  
**[0:08:56-0:08:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:56):**  and that I know I speak to the interoperability challenge for sure is the number one that  
**[0:08:59-0:09:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:08:59):**  comes up.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:00):**  You know, my my this system doesn't talk to my that system and why would I because, you  
**[0:09:05-0:09:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:05):**  know, I just can't get data from here to there.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:07):**  And so what's the point?  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:08):**  I'm going to argue by analogy first.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:10):**  And to me, this is a Y2K style problem.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:15):**  So you know, going going back in time 30 years, everyone was worried that when the clocks  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:20):**  hit January 1st 2000, the planes would drop out of the air, and the computers would stop  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:26):**  running and the stock markets would crash, etc.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:28):**  And in anticipation of that, there was a massive international effort to create code, essentially  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:34):**  computer code, that would that would harmonize those sort of issues.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:38):**  Now we're not worried in this case of a plane's falling out of the air, but maybe we should  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:41):**  be.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:42):**  I think that there needs to be a similar sized mobilization at the international level to  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:46):**  deal with data interoperability, much like we did 25 years ago in the lead up to the  
**[0:09:51-0:09:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:51):**  Y2K situation.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:53):**  And so I think that the norm, the natural place where this solution is going to be found  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:09:58):**  is international, but it's going to be require a coalition of public, private and academic  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:10:04):**  NGO partners to actually achieve it.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:10:07):**  It's such an interesting one, because the Y2K example, I remember I was, my dad was  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:10:12):**  like, Yeah, we'll get a six pack of beer, a bottle of milk and a video, it was a, you  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:10:16):**  know, an actual VHS at the time, and we'll be fine.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:10:18):**  So well, he's not worried, so maybe it will be fine.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:10:21):**  But that's a, you know, the fear of what could happen and the size of that challenge catalyzes  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:10:29):**  people to get involved and collaborate and do things they otherwise wouldn't do.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:10:32):**  Do you think we'll need some kind of similar shake to the system to solve the data interoperability?  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:10:37):**  Or we'll find a way to collaborate without that?  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:10:40):**  Well, I mean, I would like to think that we're smart enough as a species to figure out ways  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:10:45):**  of collaborating, because it's a good thing as opposed to it just avoids a bad thing.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:10:49):**  You know, I guess I in a sense, your question, Sarah seems to be are you pessimistic and  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:10:53):**  optimistic about humans ability to forward plan.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:10:56):**  And for the sake of being optimistic in this somewhat gloomy point of history, I'm going  
**[0:11:01-0:11:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:01):**  to say I'm optimistic we can do that.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:03):**  But we need to put our, our, our shoulders to the wheel or the nose to the grindstone  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:07):**  in order in order to do that.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:09):**  And I don't think that we will get the benefits of the so called digital agricultural revolution  
**[0:11:13-0:11:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:13):**  until we do this.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:14):**  I sure hope Evan is right.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:16):**  I know some great organizations are already working on this, maybe a topic for a future  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:20):**  podcast.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:21):**  But for the other two challenges, data governance and cybersecurity, what is Evan seeing in  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:26):**  terms of solutions?  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:28):**  Well, data governance is being picked up at a sort of a theoretical level by some some  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:33):**  some key organizations.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:35):**  I know there's out of the big agriculture, University of Eigenung in the Netherlands  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:39):**  is taking a leadership on this.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:41):**  There's the organization called Godin Global Organization for Data for Agriculture and  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:47):**  Nutrition, which is trying to establish some core principles.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:50):**  And really, it's the data question that we're we're facing in all sectors of the economy,  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:11:54):**  whether it's Uber or Amazon or Facebook stealing our data and using it for profit motives.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:12:00):**  And the people who produce the data feeling disenfranchised and alienated that they're  
**[0:12:04-0:12:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:12:04):**  being taken advantage of, I think it's that data writ large.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:12:07):**  And again, that's going to have to come or that's the solution that is going to come  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:12:11):**  out of an international collaboration to, I think, establish fair use principles around  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:12:17):**  data, which involves benefit sharing.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:12:19):**  In other words, if you produce data and it goes into a cloud and then an app developer  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:12:25):**  uses that data to create a decision support tool that makes your job easier, all the participants  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:12:31):**  in that chain need to have some way of sharing the benefits.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:12:34):**  So that's that's one thing that has to be worked on.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:12:36):**  And you can establish protocols around benefit sharing.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:12:39):**  Similarly, people are suspicious that if they give up their data to the cloud for this big  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:12:44):**  data revolution, they'll also be giving up privacy and anonymity and things of that nature.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:12:50):**  And again, there's there's protocols that can be established that are becoming established  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:12:54):**  that they can address those issues.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:12:56):**  Things like the data can be used, but all the metadata has to be cleaned from it such  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:00):**  that you can't trace it back to an individual farmer, for instance, or are there other things  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:04):**  like that?  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:05):**  So you have to do that, sort of have that conversation, empower the agencies to have  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:10):**  that have that discussion and create some regulations around it.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:14):**  Our team, I guess, have kind of put the challenge for farmers of the fear for farmers into three  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:18):**  buckets.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:19):**  And it's really challenging one because it limits adoption because of some of these real  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:23):**  and perceived issues.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:24):**  But one is, you know, I can't get my data or I can't use it or I can't move it from  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:28):**  system to system.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:29):**  The second is that someone else will benefit from the data.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:32):**  And the third is that actually harm will come to me.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:35):**  And those are kind of escalating levels of fear.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:37):**  But all of them prevent adoption of some of these tools that can otherwise be helpful.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:42):**  Yep.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:43):**  Sounds like we're on very convergent paths in our own little mental journeys on this  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:46):**  topic.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:47):**  So I agree with that.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:48):**  And until we deal with those fears and those anxieties, we won't have the benefits of the  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:53):**  digital ag revolution that we're that we're all so excited about.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:13:57):**  At the University of Guelph, Evan is involved in some Canadian initiatives to bring the  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:14:01):**  right stakeholders together to help solve these challenges for farmers.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:14:06):**  But as we often talk about on this podcast, bringing folks together from in and outside  
**[0:14:11-0:14:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:14:11):**  of agriculture can be challenging.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:14:14):**  So in the Canadian context, you know, a key stakeholder would be some private sector players  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:14:19):**  such as IBM or Cisco that actually have the technological expertise to do the data management.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:14:25):**  But equally, you'd need to have the Canadian Federation of Agriculture in the room in order  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:14:30):**  to speak for the farmers voices.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:14:32):**  And you'd need a few academics like me that has a sense of the big picture.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:14:37):**  And I'm useless on the details, but at least I can understand where the different groups  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:14:40):**  are coming from.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:14:42):**  And then you'd have to work through in a very deliberate and patient way, navigating all  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:14:49):**  the issues that would start with, boy, we're all speaking different languages here.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:14:52):**  So we use the same words, but we use them in different ways.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:14:55):**  So there's a translation problem to have that conversation all the way through to, okay,  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:00):**  what part of the series of recommendations this conversation would result in?  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:04):**  What part of it should actually be formal regulations that the government says you have  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:08):**  to do this?  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:09):**  What part of these are simply principles of best practice that we industry and the players  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:13):**  agree to adhere to?  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:15):**  And it becomes, I mean, for purposes of this podcast, it becomes a very boring, long winded,  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:20):**  dry process.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:21):**  But it's those boring, long winded and dry processes that I think result in both the  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:25):**  cultural change and the community of understanding that we need, as well as the formal regulations  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:31):**  and laws to govern these things.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:34):**  I love the common language challenge.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:36):**  I use that a lot.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:37):**  Maybe you have some good examples that I can steal.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:38):**  I talk about AI being artificial intelligence, artificial insemination.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:43):**  Pivot is a good one because a center pivot versus a pivot.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:46):**  Pivoting irrigation versus pivoting to address something.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:48):**  Yep, yep, yep.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:49):**  That's another ecosystem, tends to have different meetings.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:51):**  Incubator is another one.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:52):**  I don't know.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:53):**  Do you have any I can add to my list?  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:54):**  Oh, that's a good question.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:56):**  And I'm jamming on it right now.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:15:58):**  But there were three AIs.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:00):**  I was in a room and one person thought it was artificial intelligence.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:04):**  One person thought it was artificial insemination.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:06):**  Somebody thought it was something or other else.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:08):**  And we were just staring at each other baffled because no one understood what was going on  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:12):**  in the conversation.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:18):**  I could nerd out with Evan pretty much all day on ag tech adoption, but I wanted to ask  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:23):**  him about something completely different.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:25):**  Something where his experience and expertise on the history of agri supply chains and the  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:30):**  challenges we faced as a civilization would come in handy.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:34):**  COVID-19.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:35):**  How will the coronavirus pandemic impact agriculture?  
**[0:16:39-0:16:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:39):**  Well, it's so interesting, and I think I can't speak for the experience in Australia, but  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:45):**  I certainly was shocked when I went to the grocery store last weekend and for the first  
**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:49):**  time in my life saw empty shelves.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:51):**  And boy, you look at an empty shelf and you can't help but think about the zombie apocalypse.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:56):**  And you're thinking, am I about to be living through the zombie apocalypse or the plague  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:16:59):**  apocalypse or whatever it is?  
**[0:17:01-0:17:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:17:01):**  It feels it has felt like an apocalyptic week.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:17:04):**  And I think we have to acknowledge the extraordinary anxiety that being confronted with empty shelves  
**[0:17:09-0:17:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:17:09):**  presents in people.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:17:11):**  Just for a time check, as things are changing rapidly around the world, we recorded this  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:17:15):**  episode on Friday, March 20th, Canada time.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:17:18):**  Many Australians were still out and about, but in Canada, things were quite different.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:17:23):**  I live just outside of Toronto, Ontario, and we essentially are leaving the house to walk  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:17:30):**  the dog, leaving the house to go grocery shopping.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:17:34):**  That's about it.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:17:37):**  I'm getting out for a run, but I'm not running with my group anymore.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:17:40):**  I'm just running on my own.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:17:42):**  The group has been disbanded at the university, all face to face meetings have been stopped.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:17:46):**  All staff have been told to work at home.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:17:49):**  I know my colleagues are working on protocols for animal care because we're an ag college,  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:17:53):**  so we've got lots of animals that we're caring for, both laboratory and experimental.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:17:59):**  And just we have a working dairy barn.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:18:00):**  So how to staff that when the university is in lockdown is these are non-trivial issues.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:18:08):**  And the phenomenon of empty shelves has hit Canadians very hard in the last week.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:18:13):**  With that being said, our demand for food hasn't fundamentally changed.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:18:17):**  We saw a spike in food purchases last week, but our demand for food, the same number of  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:18:22):**  meals is being eaten in Canada this week as it was two weeks ago.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:18:26):**  So I have every expectation that our food system is robust enough to deal with this  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:18:32):**  kind of shock.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:18:34):**  And that with the exception of a few products, perhaps like hand sanitizer, we will see the  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:18:38):**  shock, the grocery store shelves filling back up almost immediately.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:18:43):**  And my brother works at a grocery store and I texted him this morning and he said, yep,  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:18:47):**  there's a few things that we're low on, but pretty much it's back to business as usual.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:18:51):**  Although we're restricting the number of people that come into the grocery store at a time,  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:18:55):**  and we're only operating every other cash to keep people physically distant from themselves.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:19:01):**  And they're shutting early so that they can sanitize everything every night.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:19:04):**  So some significant disruptions, but I don't think cause for panic and I don't think anybody  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:19:10):**  is necessarily going to need to go hungry as a result of a shortage.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:19:15):**  Of course, for a person, you know, in Canada is a country with 4 million food insecure  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:19:21):**  people, many of whom are in precarious employment situations.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:19:25):**  I worry that many of those people may have lost their jobs in the last week because the  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:19:29):**  service sector has essentially shut down and there's been mass layoffs for restaurants  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:19:33):**  and bars because essentially all restaurants and bars are closed, all theaters are closed,  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:19:38):**  all venues are closed.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:19:41):**  And so all those people who depend on those sources of those places for their wages are  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:19:45):**  without wages.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:19:46):**  So I think there may be a food insecurity crisis, but it's not associated with what's  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:19:51):**  on the grocery store shelves and the lack of stuff on the shelf.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:19:55):**  It's associated with people losing their people who are already precariously employed losing  
**[0:19:59-0:20:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:19:59):**  their jobs.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:20:00):**  Yeah, and you said in a recent post you wrote that we'll link in the show notes the first  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:20:06):**  thing is don't panic, you know, despite these challenges and how easy that is to say, but  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:20:10):**  hard to do that, that obviously keeping the mood calm is one of the first keys.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:20:15):**  Yeah, hopefully you haven't been seeing too much panic actually out there, but I'm sure  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:20:18):**  there is some.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:20:19):**  Yeah, I mean, I think there's anxiety.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:20:20):**  I don't think there's panic, at least in my the stuff that I'm observing.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:20:24):**  Like I said, where I am worried from a food systems perspective in terms of people going  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:20:28):**  hungry is actually loss of wages, not empty supermarket shelves.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:20:32):**  So my recommendation to all my fellow Canadians or anybody living through a period such as  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:20:38):**  this is don't panic that the groceries aren't going to be there next week if you show up  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:20:42):**  with your cart.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:20:46):**  Beyond the hoarding and supermarket behavior we've all seen and the massive challenges  
**[0:20:50-0:20:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:20:50):**  that small businesses across sectors are facing, Evan sees some longer term impacts for agriculture.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:20:57):**  I think there's some interesting longer term things that may cause the food system to adjust  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:21:02):**  in the medium to longer term.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:21:05):**  And one of them is labor.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:21:06):**  And I think I mean, I don't know about Australia, but for instance, in Canada, much of the labor  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:21:12):**  in the horticulture industry, the fruits and vegetables, the produce sector is done with  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:21:16):**  temporary foreign workers that come in for periods of time, either from Central America  
**[0:21:20-0:21:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:21:20):**  or the Caribbean is where in Ontario, most of the foreign labor comes in, and they stay  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:21:27):**  for a few months and they prune our apple orchards and they pick our strawberries and  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:21:31):**  whatnot.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:21:33):**  And boy, I think we have to question the longevity of that program.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:21:37):**  Minister of Agriculture has reassured farmers that that will continue and that we will continue  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:21:41):**  to bring in the temporary foreign workers.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:21:43):**  And I believe last year, there was about 60,000 people that came in on temporary foreign worker  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:21:48):**  programs to work on farms in Canada.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:21:50):**  So it's a big number of people.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:21:52):**  But I think that one of the legacies of COVID-19 might be a reflection on whether that is a  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:21:59):**  system that we should be relying on.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:22:02):**  And if we say no to that system, that will, I think, trigger a lot of problems for horticulture  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:22:09):**  and produce, fruit and vegetable farmers.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:22:11):**  And having studied the history of these sort of things in the past, automation and consolidation  
**[0:22:15-0:22:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:22:15):**  of farms is often the answer.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:22:17):**  So for instance, in California, about 50 years ago, they restricted migrant labor coming  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:22:21):**  into California to the tomato industry.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:22:24):**  And a lot of small tomato growers in California went out of business and sold out to bigger  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:22:28):**  growers who invested in automation, mechanical harvesters.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:22:32):**  So often, automation in agriculture comes through shortages of labor.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:22:36):**  And if we are dependent on migrant labor and decide we're not going to use migrant labor  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:22:40):**  in the future, there might be a wave of consolidation in the produce sector.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:22:45):**  And that's already underway.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:22:46):**  We know farm numbers are declining and farm sizes increasing.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:22:49):**  So that's not a new phenomenon, but it could accelerate that phenomenon.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:22:52):**  And I think that could be a big deal for a lot of producers.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:22:56):**  I also think it could be a big deal for families in the Caribbean and Latin America who come  
**[0:23:02-0:23:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:23:02):**  up to Canada every year for a few months for wages.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:23:05):**  The third big impact that Evan sees is perhaps more of a philosophical consideration.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:23:10):**  Yeah, well, I mean, I think that, and really, I'm sticking my neck out here and speaking  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:23:17):**  from my own personal anxiety.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:23:19):**  So maybe I'll change my tune in two weeks' time once the dust has settled on all this.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:23:23):**  But where I've been thinking in the last 24 or 48 hours as this story has sort of enveloped  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:23:30):**  us all is, to what extent do we want to depend on, is it appropriate to depend on, is it  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:23:36):**  desirable to depend on, is it safe to depend on a system that requires essentially the  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:23:42):**  seamless movement of goods and labor to keep us fed?  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:23:47):**  And I'm not, absolutely not saying that we should all become 100% locavores.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:23:51):**  I love the benefits that international trade brings us in terms of cost and convenience  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:23:57):**  and a variety of diets and all that stuff.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:24:01):**  I'm a big fan.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:24:02):**  But maybe one of the legacies of COVID-19 and the spring of 2020 will be a reflection  
**[0:24:09-0:24:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:24:09):**  on what is the right balance of local regional self-sufficiency and global trade in both  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:24:17):**  labor and food and technology.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:24:20):**  And is there sort of a portfolio that we should be aiming for as opposed to saying we're all  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:24:27):**  one or all the other?  
**[0:24:28-0:24:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:24:28):**  What's the right blended portfolio to maintain resilience alongside efficiency in our global  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:24:35):**  food system?  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:24:36):**  And I honestly don't have an answer for that one because I'm speculating from a philosophical  
**[0:24:41-0:24:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:24:41):**  perspective.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:24:43):**  But my intuition is that perhaps we will think of the food system of the new 20-teens as  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:24:50):**  overly globalized and therefore vulnerable to shocks.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:24:54):**  And maybe we will reinvigorate regional food systems as a result.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:24:59):**  Like I said, I'm working through these ideas in my mind.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:25:01):**  I'm not coming up with a firm pronouncement.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:25:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:25:05):**  Well, I appreciate you sharing those early thoughts with us.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:25:09):**  I've definitely seen a few kind of hardcore ag economists and experts saying, oh, maybe  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:25:14):**  that brushing off of local food makes less sense than I thought it did.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:25:20):**  So I've seen a few people in this last week kind of reconsidering that balanced food system.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:25:24):**  And it's definitely something we believe technology also can help, that there'll be a range of  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:25:28):**  food systems and farm production systems, small and large and local and global, and  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:25:33):**  that that's probably a more resilient system overall, which maybe this shock catalyzes  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:25:37):**  some of that in the future.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:25:38):**  Well, that's a really interesting point.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:25:41):**  And I'm going to riff on that, what you just said there, Sarah, for a second.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:25:45):**  If you go back to the Green Revolution, I mean, the technologies of the Green Revolution  
**[0:25:49-0:25:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:25:49):**  were really, in my mind, all about homogenization.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:25:52):**  Can you create a massive economy of scale by doing essentially exactly the same thing  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:25:58):**  with the same genomics, with the same tractor over an enormous area?  
**[0:26:04-0:26:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:26:04):**  And it was a one, you know, really Green Revolution technologies are a one size fits all kind  
**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:26:10):**  of management strategy.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:26:11):**  Whereas I would say that smart tractors, digital technologies, precision agriculture, it's  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:26:17):**  all about managing variation.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:26:19):**  It's about changing, responding to things on a range of different scales, planting the  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:26:24):**  right seed in the right point in the field and giving it the right amount of fertilizer  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:26:27):**  as the promise of a smart tractor or a robotic milker that allows the cow to milk herself  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:26:33):**  when she wants it, as opposed to sort of on a schedule that's prescribed by the farmer  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:26:37):**  or using accelerometers to determine whether the cow goes into heat so that they can breed  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:26:42):**  themselves as opposed to using hormones to make them, breed them on a schedule.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:26:46):**  I mean, I think that one of the benefits of the digital ag revolution, which I hope we  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:26:51):**  realize and I hope isn't hype, getting back to our early part of the conversation, is  
**[0:26:55-0:27:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:26:55):**  the ability to do farming at a range of scales and in a far more bespoke way in sort of in  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:27:02):**  near real time on a meter by meter basis or manage each plant and animal as individuals.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:27:08):**  And that might give us a huge amount more diversity and, to your point, resilience in  
**[0:27:13-0:27:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:27:13):**  the system.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:27:14):**  And so if anything I'm hoping comes out of this is maybe we catalyze that kind of embracing  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:27:19):**  of diversity that's enabled then by these digital technologies.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:27:23):**  And wouldn't that be a good outcome?  
**[0:27:25-0:27:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:27:25):**  We all need a bit of positive news right now.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:27:27):**  So we'll leave it there with Evan Frazier, just after he takes me up on the opportunity  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:27:32):**  for a shameless plug of what he's up to and where you can find more about him.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:27:37):**  Yeah, well happy to have the opportunity to do some self-promotion.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:27:41):**  Arrolfoodinstitute.ca, that's A-double-R-E-double-L. Arrolfoodinstitute.ca is the interdisciplinary  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:27:47):**  institute that I am the director of.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:27:50):**  I also curate a series of educational resources including a card game and a graphic novel  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:27:55):**  and a series of lectures, etc. on a website called Feeding9Billion.com.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:28:01):**  So that's Feeding9Billion.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:28:02):**  And we have a YouTube channel as well where you can get access to me or track me down  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:28:06):**  on Twitter on Feeding9Billion.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=600708#t=0:28:08):**  Awesome Evan, thank you so much for taking the time to do this and really appreciate

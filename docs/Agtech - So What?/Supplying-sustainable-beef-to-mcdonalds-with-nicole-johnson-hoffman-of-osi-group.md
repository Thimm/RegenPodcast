### Agtech - So What?  (2020-08-26)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the AgTech So What podcast brought to you by Agthentic. I'm your host, Sarah  Nolette. Today we are taking a sidestep from our Regen Ag series to bring you a guest who  is a leader in sustainability in the global beef industry. She has spent her career in  
**[0:00:19-0:00:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:00:19):**  beef and isn't afraid of defending it.  I personally believe that beef production is good for the planet. I think beef production  is good for our communities. I think it's good for it's a net positive for people. And  
**[0:00:37-0:00:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:00:37):**  so I that's my perspective. I know others don't share it. I get that. But I'm in the  I'm in the space that believes that. So trying to figure out ways to make it even better  is my goal.  
**[0:00:51-0:01:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:00:51):**  That is Nicole Johnson Hoffman. Nicole is the global McDonald's business unit leader  and chief sustainability officer at OSI Group, a massive privately held meat processing company  with over 65 facilities in 17 countries and a major supplier of McDonald's. Nicole was  
**[0:01:10-0:01:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:01:10):**  also the founding chairperson of the US Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, served two terms as  the president of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef and spent 19 years at Cargill,  both as in house counsel and across beef plant operations in the US and in Asia. And if that  
**[0:01:28-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:01:28):**  isn't enough, Nicole was even on Oprah in the late 1990s during the infamous feud with  the American cattle industry. But more on all that later.  I grew up on a dairy farm in central Minnesota, but it wasn't cattle. It was dairy goats.  
**[0:01:44-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:01:44):**  And it was a tiny, tiny little farm. My parents had jobs in town. I would say they were almost  hobbyists in terms of running the farm. It was quite a lot of work. It was beautiful  and bucolic as sort of every urban person's dream in terms of organic farming and really  
**[0:02:03-0:02:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:02:03):**  personal connection to the animals we raised and to the food that we produced. But it was  also interestingly really inefficient. And I like to say we fed almost no one with all  of our hard work at that farm. And I find that that's a really important thing to share  
**[0:02:20-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:02:20):**  with people because it was part of my learning journey. I started in agriculture in that  kind of an environment and I have really become a believer now in scale and in efficiency.  And the important role is scale and efficiency have to play in feeding a hungry world. So  
**[0:02:41-0:02:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:02:41):**  it all sort of started on that goat farm in Minnesota.  Nicole, of all the things I thought we might have in common living on a small goat dairy  was not one of them, but that's true. I lived on a small goat dairy in Chile of all places.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:02:57):**  We had about 60 goats that I was responsible for milking. And yes, I agree with lots of  the inefficiencies. It also was part of my kind of journey into agriculture and realizing  how much technology could play a role in helping to bring those efficiencies and how good that  
**[0:03:13-0:03:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:03:13):**  would be for the land and the animals and the humans. So that resonates really strongly  with me. Yeah, it's interesting. People really believe  that you have to harden your heart in order to work in animal agriculture. And so when  
**[0:03:27-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:03:27):**  I tell them that we hand raised these goats, we bottle fed them, we milked them twice a  day, we played with them, we named them. And then ultimately when they had a second career  as meat, we ate them. I think people are astonished that you can care for an animal and give them  
**[0:03:48-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:03:48):**  a tremendous amount of your life over to making sure that that animal has a great life and  also feel just fine about consuming animal products.  For sure. So you professionally became a lawyer, studied law as I understand it. How did you  
**[0:04:05-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:04:05):**  end up back in agriculture? Was that always the goal to work in agriculture professionally?  Not really. When I was growing up on the farm, I vowed I would never have dirt under my fingernails  again. I hate that sensation. I was sure that I was going to choose a life far away from  
**[0:04:23-0:04:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:04:23):**  agriculture. And I went to law school and I had some ideas of what I might like to do,  but I went to work for Cargill as in-house counsel directly out of law school. Amazingly,  they recruited me out of law school and hired me and taught me how to be a lawyer. And I  
**[0:04:41-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:04:41):**  worked initially in their financial services business and did that for a number of years.  And it allowed me the chance to wear pinstripe suits and carry leather briefcases and keep  my fingernails clean. And I really liked it.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:04:55):**  Nicole dealt with some pretty important issues in this role at Cargill.  So there was a number of E. coli outbreaks that we were struggling with in the industry.  And of course, the legal issues that come along with those kinds of illnesses and the  
**[0:05:09-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:05:09):**  impact on people. We also had a lot of immigration issues arising at that time. So that was during  a time when there was a lot of immigration enforcement action occurring in the U.S. and  you saw plants being raided and plant workers being sort of sorted out to try and find people  
**[0:05:26-0:05:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:05:26):**  who were maybe not there under their real names and things like that.  Nicole loved this role, but after a while, she was given the opportunity to try something  very different.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:05:38):**  But then they transferred me to the meat business in Kansas, just intending it to be a short  stint. I was there for a couple of years and I just came to love it. So I realized that  I'd been away from the people in the industry that really spoke to my heart for too long.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:05:58):**  And I recognized my people in my tribe, if you will, when I saw them. So I love the meat  business. It has become my life's work. And after being the lead lawyer for Cargill's  Meat Businesses for, I guess, six years, they offered me the chance to go run one of their  
**[0:06:16-0:06:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:06:16):**  beef processing plants. And I took it and ran. It was difficult because I really liked  being a lawyer. So the plant they offered me the opportunity to run is the plant in  Fort Morgan, Colorado. At that time, we had about 2,500 employees. The plant process,  
**[0:06:35-0:06:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:06:35):**  5,000 head of cattle a day. I mean, you know, it had a payroll of something like $60 million  a year. I mean, it was an incredible operation doing really important work, in my opinion,  not just making food for the world over, but employing all of those people, keeping a town  
**[0:06:53-0:07:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:06:53):**  prosperous, a town that without that plant might have struggled and failed like so many  little towns in this country have done, and also supporting farmers locally who raise  cattle and need an outlet for them. So, boy, I mean, I still to this day, I'm dumbstruck  
**[0:07:11-0:07:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:07:11):**  with gratitude for that opportunity. I really loved it. It was a high point in my life.  Yeah. I remember the first abattoir I went through. It's this sort of unveiling of the  black box. Like, you know what happens in the beginning and you know what happens at  
**[0:07:27-0:07:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:07:27):**  the end and you've just never seen the middle. And I remember going through the first plant  and it was actually a sheep abattoir and I was so fascinated. I had the same experience  of just the complexity and the human elements and the technology elements and the safety  
**[0:07:42-0:07:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:07:42):**  elements. And it's really quite a fascinating operation that is often just a black box that  people don't see inside or let alone think about running and operating and managing all  the complexities around. Yeah. I mean, there's really a, I'll say a sisterhood or a fraternity  
**[0:07:59-0:08:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:07:59):**  of people who have had that experience, who have worked in those kinds of facilities or  who at least spent a lot of time in them because we understand and we know that there's something  really wonderful and special happening there that other people can't even imagine. And  
**[0:08:15-0:08:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:08:15):**  they don't believe you when you try and describe it to them. So that's what I always find a  little tricky, right? I mean, people can't believe how great it can be to work in one  of those facilities and to be part of one of those amazing teams. It's emotional.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:08:32):**  During this time, Nicole had a front row seat to how conversations on sustainability and  ethics in the meat industry were rapidly changing.  When I first started working in the meat business, which is almost 20 years ago now, we were  
**[0:08:49-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:08:49):**  incredibly confident in how we were producing food for the world and the decisions that  we were making along the way. We felt very sure that we were making the best decisions,  that we were solving the problems that mattered and we were solving them in the right ways.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:09:08):**  And we definitely didn't want to hear from anybody who wasn't a expert or a scientist  or someone who worked in the industry or maybe a shareholder of our companies if they wanted  to talk about how they felt about what we were doing.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:09:27):**  Engaging with stakeholders beyond those small groups of people was just not something we  were willing to do. We didn't think we should have to. We were incredibly defensive about  the decisions that we made and the ways we've solved problems in agriculture over the last  
**[0:09:45-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:09:45):**  50 years. And that came from a place of pride. I'll say it's literal blood, sweat and tears  that people in American agriculture put into producing food for the world. And they're  not delighted to have people question their commitment or their intelligence or their  
**[0:10:08-0:10:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:10:08):**  choices. But boy, is it different today. We have really seen a change in the industry.  We've seen a willingness to be transparent, a willingness to explain ourselves, explain  how we've arrived at the kinds of practices that we follow, why we do the things we do,  
**[0:10:30-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:10:30):**  what kinds of problems we've been trying to solve with these practices. I've been part  of some of those efforts of transparency and I think every time I've been glad we've done  it. And now we're actually even past that sort of initial transparency step. Now we're  
**[0:10:46-0:11:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:10:46):**  almost to a consultative approach, I'll say.  This journey hasn't always been easy. Back in the 90s, Oprah Winfrey discussed mad cow  disease on her show, and she said she was turned off from eating meat. In response,  
**[0:11:02-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:11:02):**  the American Cattlemen's Association filed a lawsuit against her claiming $10 million  in damages.  That was a height, I would say, of industry defensiveness, that moment where the industry  
**[0:11:16-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:11:16):**  decided, you know, what we really need to do is attack a television personality who's  made of maybe a sort of not particularly well considered comment about our product. And  we, you know, let's absolutely fight this thing to the map.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:11:30):**  The industry was quickly changing though. Just a few years later, Oprah wanted to do  a show about how meat was produced, and they came to Cargill.  They'd asked others in the industry, and the industry had said no, because she had this  
**[0:11:44-0:11:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:11:44):**  history of having said one not positive thing about meat production, and now no one wanted  to do this show, no one wanted to participate, and they were going to let this program go  on where they were going to talk about meat production without anybody from the industry  
**[0:11:59-0:12:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:11:59):**  providing a perspective or a counterpoint.  So Cargill ultimately decided, you know, with a whole bunch of discussion, that we were  going to do the show. And so we did it, we either came through and filmed in our plant  
**[0:12:11-0:12:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:12:11):**  in Colorado and then invited me to come back to the Oprah studio in Chicago for the in-studio  portion of the discussion. And I found it to be a really balanced, careful conversation.  Granted, you know, there were perspectives shared from vegans and people who disagreed  
**[0:12:30-0:12:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:12:30):**  with eating meat or producing meat the way we produce it in the US, but the industry  was offered the opportunity to share its view, and we did, and it was reasonably well received,  actually.  
**[0:12:41-0:13:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:12:41):**  So for me, that watching the first Oprah situation evolve into the second Oprah situation, I  think was really important. And what the industry learned is that if you don't show up, no one  will tell your story. And if you react to questions or comments or maybe even not so  
**[0:13:01-0:13:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:13:01):**  informed opinions with defensiveness and, you know, an aggressive posture, you're going  to achieve a lot less than if you have sort of a constructive engagement. And so based  on that, then, you know, I personally tried to strive for constructive engagement wherever  
**[0:13:19-0:13:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:13:19):**  possible.  Like Nicole said, things have really changed. Some of this has been for commercial reasons,  like what consumers want, and some of it has been through pressure from activists.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:13:31):**  There are certain issues that have really been led by interest groups and let's say  NGOs and others who care deeply about a particular issue, let's say protection of forests and  avoiding land conversion. That issue in particular has been driven by these NGOs and interest  
**[0:13:54-0:14:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:13:54):**  groups. And they took that issue to the brands first. And they said to the brands, you don't  want your brand associated with problems. Your brand is in your supply chain. You have  these issues. You should be addressing them. And many brands paid attention and said, interesting.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:14:16):**  Let's learn and have dug into those kinds of issues and then have worked with their  suppliers like the company I work for today or like Cargill and to try to root out problems  in their supply chain that maybe they weren't aware of beforehand.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:14:30):**  I think that's been a really positive thing. That's a situation where stakeholders have  helped identify problems and have used the tools they can use to try to get them addressed,  and attention for those problems. I think there's a process of discovery that never  
**[0:14:48-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:14:48):**  ends. So when you are working in an industry like food production, where trade-offs have  to be made and are being made in really sophisticated ways or all around the world in order to feed  a hungry population, you need to understand which trade-offs are being made, how decisions  
**[0:15:09-0:15:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:15:09):**  are being arrived at, is there a better solution that hasn't been identified yet, and are there  problems you've never even heard of in places you've never even thought of that you actually  are somewhat accountable for solving. And that's the cool thing that's going on today  
**[0:15:27-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:15:27):**  in sustainability. Nicole is responsible for the sustainability  of the beef that's supplied to companies like McDonald's, which can't be an easy task, especially  given McDonald's hasn't always had the best reputation on the health and environmental  
**[0:15:42-0:15:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:15:42):**  front. Some listeners will remember the polystyrene packaging from the 1980s. But the supply chain  relationship between the OSI group, where Nicole works, and McDonald's is an old one,  which keeps evolving with the demands of the times.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:15:56):**  OSI is a private company. We're based here in the Chicago area. We're over 100 years  old. We were formed initially as a meat pushcart butcher business, and we've evolved significantly  from there. And we have people all over the world, and we are primarily a further processor  
**[0:16:18-0:16:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:16:18):**  of foods. Our biggest segment of customers is the food service segment. And one of our  original big food service customers was of course McDonald's. So as McDonald's expanded  around the world, OSI built factories to serve them around the world. And we still are fortunate

And your role, Nicole, just to connect all those dots?  
**[0:16:47-0:17:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:16:47):**  I run OSI's global McDonald's business, and I'm also at the same time OSI's chief sustainability  officer. So they're two different jobs, but fortunately they have a lot of overlap because  as you may be aware, McDonald's is passionately working on sustainability issues in the meat  
**[0:17:06-0:17:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:17:06):**  space in addition to the other foods that they work on.  Yeah. And who doesn't want two jobs when you could have one while?  So tell me about how the conversation with McDonald's, which you've been involved with  
**[0:17:22-0:17:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:17:22):**  for a while, has changed around sustainability. McDonald's is such an interesting one because  I would say in the American view, at least they sometimes can be vilified, whether for  health reasons or corporate reasons or now sustainability reasons. But like anything,  
**[0:17:37-0:17:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:17:37):**  there are many, many sides to the story. What's the sustainability conversation been like  with McDonald's over the years?  Sure. I mean, as with so many things, what the average person on the street thinks compared  
**[0:17:51-0:18:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:17:51):**  to what people who are involved in the work know is quite different when it comes to brands.  So certain brands might have a halo as being very socially responsible and maybe the average  person on the street likes their advertisements and thinks they're a force for good in the  
**[0:18:11-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:18:11):**  world. But it's really the people who are their suppliers who know whether or not they  actually care. And the way you know if the brand cares about these issues is whether  they're willing to invest. So do they put their money where their mouth is? Do they  
**[0:18:25-0:18:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:18:25):**  actually make choices based on these kinds of sustainability considerations? Are they  really making a difference in supply chains or are they just cherry picking certain expensive  high end products that are only available to some wealthy people? And I think the thing  
**[0:18:44-0:19:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:18:44):**  that's always impressed me about the McDonald's company and its approach is that they change  entire supply chains. So when they come in and they say, you know, we've reconsidered  how we feel about a certain production practice in animal agriculture and we would like a  
**[0:19:03-0:19:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:19:03):**  change here, entire production systems change. So the beef you buy at a grocery store is  produced differently because McDonald's required changes in beef factories 15 years ago. Only  McDonald's, only mass brands can change the world. These niche brands can change certain  
**[0:19:26-0:19:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:19:26):**  products for certain people. But these mass brands are the ones who move the entire industry.  And that is where the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef comes in. Nicole founded  the U.S. branch of this group, which is made up of several mass suppliers such as OSI and  
**[0:19:42-0:20:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:19:42):**  Cargill, as well as producers, industry bodies and retailers such as McDonald's. The Global  Roundtable for Sustainable Beef was initially formed by a group of stakeholders who represented  different parts of the beef value chain, who wanted to come together and bring some harmony  
**[0:20:00-0:20:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:20:00):**  to these discussions around sustainability related issues. It wasn't ever a one issue  organization. It was always meant to address the holistic concept of sustainability. The  first thing we had to agree was that it doesn't really work to mandate a particular production  
**[0:20:19-0:20:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:20:19):**  method or a particular practice for the reasons I've already said. The conditions are quite  different. The cattle themselves are quite different. The expectations of a community  or the resources of a community vary so dramatically around the world. And the beauty of beef,  
**[0:20:36-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:20:36):**  of course, is that it can be produced in really diverse situations. That's the wonder of cattle.  So we knew we didn't want to pick winners and losers. We didn't want to come out and  say, well, this production system is good, but this production system is bad. Because  
**[0:20:52-0:21:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:20:52):**  anyone with any kind of sophistication understands that that actually isn't true. So we wanted  to come up with these principles and criteria. And then we really wanted to charge the beef  producing areas of the world with the task of going out and addressing what are the highest  
**[0:21:11-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:21:11):**  priority issues in their area? What are the problems in their supply chains? What are  the solutions available to them? And encourage them to do that work on their own and then  come back and share the results of that with the global roundtable, which has worked out  
**[0:21:30-0:21:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:21:30):**  really well. So it's important not to tell beef producers around the world what to do,  because we all know people don't go into farming because they want to take orders. But it is  important to provide them an opportunity to discover things they don't know about their  
**[0:21:49-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:21:49):**  supply chains, reconsider practices or approaches based on input from others, and then share  their learnings so that we can all improve.  I would say the biggest thing, and be curious if you agree or not, that's in the conversation  
**[0:22:05-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:22:05):**  right now is the greenhouse gas footprint of beef production from enteric emissions  all the way through the supply chain. Was that a big part of the conversation in setting  up that roundtable or has that come to the forefront more recently?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:22:19):**  No, it always has been part of the conversation and a really important part of the conversation.  But I think, let's say pre-COVID because COVID is so present at the moment that it obscures  almost everything else. But pre-COVID about nine months ago, I would have said to you,  
**[0:22:38-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:22:38):**  it is the issue. So I think we've really seen an evolution in our understanding that all  aspects of beef sustainability are critical. All aspects of beef sustainability are important.  But if we can't get this climate thing right, nothing else really is going to matter for  
**[0:22:56-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:22:56):**  all kinds of reasons. One, because of the climate, but two, because of people's concerns  about beef and its impact on the climate. And if we can't address those concerns, we're  going to have a whole other issue.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:23:10):**  So tell me about some of the responses to that and maybe that gets into regenerative  agriculture a bit. And I guess the role of manufacturers like Cargill and OSI in that  supply chain. So I guess tell me about how Regen Ag has entered the conversation and  
**[0:23:25-0:23:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:23:25):**  where that kind of fits into the broader sustainability picture.  Well, I think the really cool thing that's coming out today is the ways that farmers  and practices on farm can actually be sort of the climate heroes. And we are seeing a  
**[0:23:41-0:24:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:23:41):**  real interest in documenting the positive impacts that farming practices can have on  climate. The ways that healthy soils, for example, can serve as a carbon sink. And how  can you manage your soils and manage your grasses and manage your animals in a way to  
**[0:24:03-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:24:03):**  provide ecosystem services to the planet, not just meat to the planet. And that is a  really cool thing that's going on right now. So I'm excited about that work, but that's  not the only work I'm excited about. I'm excited about the work that's being done to reduce  
**[0:24:20-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:24:20):**  emissions in cattle with feed ration changes or other practices in how we feed the animals  and when we feed the animals that can have a positive impact on the emissions that they  produce. And I want to say it's really important for me to say out loud that I personally believe  
**[0:24:40-0:25:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:24:40):**  that beef production is good for the planet. I think beef production is good for our communities.  I think it's good for, it's a net positive for people. And so I, that's my perspective.  I know others don't share it. I get that, but I'm in the space that believes that. So  
**[0:25:01-0:25:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:25:01):**  trying to figure out the ways to make it even better is my goal.  Yep. And what's an example of that in the sustainability space, or I don't know what  the regen conversation is like with McDonald's. Are there any big changes to the supply chain  
**[0:25:16-0:25:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:25:16):**  in that area that McDonald's is driving?  McDonald's, I can't speak for them of course, because I don't work for McDonald's, but they  have made some really interesting announcements recently about supporting work done to detail  
**[0:25:32-0:25:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:25:32):**  the science around adaptive multipathic grazing and trying to quantify the climate improvements  that might happen through soil improvements. So there's a really cool project that they're,  I think, helping drive and fund that's working on that here in North America. And now my  
**[0:25:51-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:25:51):**  understanding is it's being expanded to other parts of the world as well. And that's just  something that they want to be part of and are working on. It's not about putting a different  hamburger on the menu. It's about changing the way food is produced for everyone.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:26:07):**  How does that work at OSI? So as head of sustainability, what are the kinds of initiatives that you're  excited about and how does that play out in the upstream supply chain for you guys? What  kind of levers or drivers do you think about in terms of driving change?  
**[0:26:22-0:26:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:26:22):**  Well, we work of course to ensure that our own operations, I call it our four gray walls  of our factories, are as sustainable as possible. But we're also now really trying to help be  a force for good in our supply chains. So we're not stopping at our own factories. We're  
**[0:26:42-0:27:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:26:42):**  actually going all the way back to farms and looking at farmers who are leading the way  in progressive farming practices, trying to recognize those farmers in a way that's meaningful  for them so that they know that people see what they're doing and value that contribution.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:27:01):**  And then also trying to support activities they care about. So we have a program we call  OSI Sustainability 365, which is a farmer recognition program where we choose certain  farmers that we think are deserving of that recognition and we say to them, what do you  
**[0:27:19-0:27:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:27:19):**  care about? What are you working on this year? How could we support that? So one of the farms  that we work on is a operation, a beef operation in Australia, and they really care deeply  about trees, about planting trees and healing, I'll say a farm that in one case they inherited  
**[0:27:39-0:27:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:27:39):**  that had been pretty well deforested. And so that's where we can come in and help them  so we can support that tree planting effort and at the same time promote the work they're  doing so that other farmers can learn from them.  
**[0:27:52-0:28:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:27:52):**  And does that support, I guess the levers that come to mind for me, there's premiums,  there's long-term contracts, there's financial support for something like tree planting or  other practices that might have kind of co-benefits or ecosystem services, but might be a net  
**[0:28:09-0:28:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:28:09):**  cost negative without support. There's education or training. How do you guys think about the  range of tools in the toolkit and which ones to use in different cases?  For us, the answer is all of the above. So we are interested in, in some parts of the  
**[0:28:28-0:28:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:28:28):**  world, in Europe in particular, we have some programs where farmers are paid a premium  for producing beef that is, that meets certain sustainability standards. That's a really  cool program and we're really excited about that. In other parts of the world, that doesn't  
**[0:28:44-0:29:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:28:44):**  seem to be possible, at least not today. So that's where you might say, you know, if somebody  wants to plant trees, we can buy some trees, right? That kind of a straightforward direct  support is what we can do there. In other parts of the world, particularly here in North  
**[0:29:01-0:29:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:29:01):**  American market, which is really sophisticated and really big, we are supporting a lot of  education programs. So what there are groups that are going out and trying to help farmers  get the knowledge that they want, we're helping to support those education programs.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:29:17):**  Sure. And the term even regenerative agriculture is decently controversial. Do you have a view  on that term? I noticed you haven't kind of used it, but what's your view on what can  otherwise be a polarizing or controversial term?  
**[0:29:32-0:29:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:29:32):**  Well, I'll give you the answer that I sometimes give when we get into questions about what  does the word sustainability mean? What does the word regenerative mean? Shouldn't we be  using a different word? Isn't there a better one? And then, you know, we all want to fight  
**[0:29:48-0:30:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:29:48):**  over semantics. I am out of the business of fighting over semantics. I did that. I'm a  middle aged lady now. I'm too old and tired to bicker over what we should call things.  So I leave those questions to communications experts. They can decide what to call something  
**[0:30:05-0:30:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:30:05):**  they can, and I'm happy to use whatever language anybody wants me to use. I'm about action.  And I work in an industry that's about action. So if you're working on things that are improving  sustainability outcomes for the production of food for people around the world, you're  
**[0:30:24-0:30:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:30:24):**  doing good work. I want to be part of that and I want to support it. You can call it  regenerative because I really, I mean, I like that language and I believe in the concept  or you can call it Sally. I don't care what we call it. I'm in the business of doing it.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:30:41):**  Yeah. And how do you think, or how do I know, so I think about the need for a kind of scientific  underpinning. Like if you're supporting tree planting, is there a measurement framework  around tons of carbon or CO2 equivalent sequestered? If you're doing sustainability sourcing, are  
**[0:30:58-0:31:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:30:58):**  you, you know, measuring changes in certain factors?  I really believe strongly that you have got to have data and science to back up your recommendations  to farmers around the world. And that's because they are not playing with the house's money.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:31:17):**  They are betting their own money, their own livelihoods, their legacy for their children  and their inheritance from their grandparents that we're right. We had better be right when  we ask farmers to change something. So anybody who gets impatient with farmers and says,  
**[0:31:35-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:31:35):**  you know, I read this cool article yesterday on Bloomberg about how every farmer on planet  earth should be implementing this, you know, changed practice. Why haven't they done it  yet? It's Tuesday. That's my answer. It's really easy for a corporate suit like me to  
**[0:31:52-0:32:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:31:52):**  sit in a suburban office building and say, well, maybe they ought to try amp grazing  on their on their land with their cattle. OK, what if I'm wrong? What if my recommendation  is wrong? Am I willing to take the risk with that family farm?  
**[0:32:11-0:32:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:32:11):**  I'm sure you get asked all the time about kind of alternative proteins, whether plant-based,  whether cellular agriculture. What's your current thinking in response to challenges  around the growth of that industry and what it will mean for the future of livestock production?  
**[0:32:27-0:32:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:32:27):**  I think there's really a false dichotomy that's been built up in particular. I think it's  coming from trade press and even mainstream media about this kind of choice between plant-based  proteins or cell-based proteins and animal agriculture and animal proteins. I don't think  
**[0:32:48-0:33:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:32:48):**  there's any kind of an either or involved here. I think the idea that we all have to  make a choice and you only get one, which side are you on is silly. It's not the way  people eat and it's not the way the world works. So there's lots of room in people's  
**[0:33:05-0:33:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:33:05):**  diets for new kinds of foods. And if people enjoy plant-based proteins or even cell-based  meats and they want to make room in their diet for that, I say good luck and God bless.  That's a wonderful thing. Incidentally, farmers are involved in the production of all of those  
**[0:33:26-0:33:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:33:26):**  products anyway, so that's all good for me. I don't believe that these products are ultimately  going to take meat out of our diets. I think animal agriculture and meat protein is really  great for people. I think it's really great for communities. I think it's great for this  
**[0:33:46-0:34:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:33:46):**  planet and I will fight hard to ensure that we continuously improve all of our outcomes  and make it better and better and better.  And I guess, do you see a role in making some of those improvements and continuing to fight,

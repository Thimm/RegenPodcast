### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 20:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to the AgTech So What podcast brought to you by Agthentic. I'm your host, Sarah  
**[0:00:07-0:00:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:00:07):**  Nolette. Today we are taking a sidestep from our Regen Ag series to bring you a guest who  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:00:14):**  is a leader in sustainability in the global beef industry. She has spent her career in  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:00:19):**  beef and isn't afraid of defending it.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:00:23):**  I personally believe that beef production is good for the planet. I think beef production  
**[0:00:29-0:00:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:00:29):**  is good for our communities. I think it's good for it's a net positive for people. And  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:00:37):**  so I that's my perspective. I know others don't share it. I get that. But I'm in the  
**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:00:42):**  I'm in the space that believes that. So trying to figure out ways to make it even better  
**[0:00:49-0:00:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:00:49):**  is my goal.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:00:51):**  That is Nicole Johnson Hoffman. Nicole is the global McDonald's business unit leader  
**[0:00:55-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:00:55):**  and chief sustainability officer at OSI Group, a massive privately held meat processing company  
**[0:01:02-0:01:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:01:02):**  with over 65 facilities in 17 countries and a major supplier of McDonald's. Nicole was  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:01:10):**  also the founding chairperson of the US Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, served two terms as  
**[0:01:15-0:01:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:01:15):**  the president of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef and spent 19 years at Cargill,  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:01:22):**  both as in house counsel and across beef plant operations in the US and in Asia. And if that  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:01:28):**  isn't enough, Nicole was even on Oprah in the late 1990s during the infamous feud with  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:01:33):**  the American cattle industry. But more on all that later.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:01:37):**  I grew up on a dairy farm in central Minnesota, but it wasn't cattle. It was dairy goats.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:01:44):**  And it was a tiny, tiny little farm. My parents had jobs in town. I would say they were almost  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:01:50):**  hobbyists in terms of running the farm. It was quite a lot of work. It was beautiful  
**[0:01:56-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:01:56):**  and bucolic as sort of every urban person's dream in terms of organic farming and really  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:02:03):**  personal connection to the animals we raised and to the food that we produced. But it was  
**[0:02:08-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:02:08):**  also interestingly really inefficient. And I like to say we fed almost no one with all  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:02:15):**  of our hard work at that farm. And I find that that's a really important thing to share  
**[0:02:20-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:02:20):**  with people because it was part of my learning journey. I started in agriculture in that  
**[0:02:27-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:02:27):**  kind of an environment and I have really become a believer now in scale and in efficiency.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:02:35):**  And the important role is scale and efficiency have to play in feeding a hungry world. So  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:02:41):**  it all sort of started on that goat farm in Minnesota.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:02:44):**  Nicole, of all the things I thought we might have in common living on a small goat dairy  
**[0:02:49-0:02:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:02:49):**  was not one of them, but that's true. I lived on a small goat dairy in Chile of all places.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:02:57):**  We had about 60 goats that I was responsible for milking. And yes, I agree with lots of  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:03:03):**  the inefficiencies. It also was part of my kind of journey into agriculture and realizing  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:03:08):**  how much technology could play a role in helping to bring those efficiencies and how good that  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:03:13):**  would be for the land and the animals and the humans. So that resonates really strongly  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:03:18):**  with me. Yeah, it's interesting. People really believe  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:03:23):**  that you have to harden your heart in order to work in animal agriculture. And so when  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:03:27):**  I tell them that we hand raised these goats, we bottle fed them, we milked them twice a  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:03:33):**  day, we played with them, we named them. And then ultimately when they had a second career  
**[0:03:39-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:03:39):**  as meat, we ate them. I think people are astonished that you can care for an animal and give them  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:03:48):**  a tremendous amount of your life over to making sure that that animal has a great life and  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:03:54):**  also feel just fine about consuming animal products.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:03:59):**  For sure. So you professionally became a lawyer, studied law as I understand it. How did you  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:04:05):**  end up back in agriculture? Was that always the goal to work in agriculture professionally?  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:04:11):**  Not really. When I was growing up on the farm, I vowed I would never have dirt under my fingernails  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:04:17):**  again. I hate that sensation. I was sure that I was going to choose a life far away from  
**[0:04:23-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:04:23):**  agriculture. And I went to law school and I had some ideas of what I might like to do,  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:04:31):**  but I went to work for Cargill as in-house counsel directly out of law school. Amazingly,  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:04:36):**  they recruited me out of law school and hired me and taught me how to be a lawyer. And I  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:04:41):**  worked initially in their financial services business and did that for a number of years.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:04:46):**  And it allowed me the chance to wear pinstripe suits and carry leather briefcases and keep  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:04:52):**  my fingernails clean. And I really liked it.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:04:55):**  Nicole dealt with some pretty important issues in this role at Cargill.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:04:59):**  So there was a number of E. coli outbreaks that we were struggling with in the industry.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:05:04):**  And of course, the legal issues that come along with those kinds of illnesses and the  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:05:09):**  impact on people. We also had a lot of immigration issues arising at that time. So that was during  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:05:15):**  a time when there was a lot of immigration enforcement action occurring in the U.S. and  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:05:19):**  you saw plants being raided and plant workers being sort of sorted out to try and find people  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:05:26):**  who were maybe not there under their real names and things like that.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:05:31):**  Nicole loved this role, but after a while, she was given the opportunity to try something  
**[0:05:36-0:05:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:05:36):**  very different.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:05:38):**  But then they transferred me to the meat business in Kansas, just intending it to be a short  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:05:43):**  stint. I was there for a couple of years and I just came to love it. So I realized that  
**[0:05:50-0:05:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:05:50):**  I'd been away from the people in the industry that really spoke to my heart for too long.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:05:58):**  And I recognized my people in my tribe, if you will, when I saw them. So I love the meat  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:06:05):**  business. It has become my life's work. And after being the lead lawyer for Cargill's  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:06:11):**  Meat Businesses for, I guess, six years, they offered me the chance to go run one of their  
**[0:06:16-0:06:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:06:16):**  beef processing plants. And I took it and ran. It was difficult because I really liked  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:06:23):**  being a lawyer. So the plant they offered me the opportunity to run is the plant in  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:06:28):**  Fort Morgan, Colorado. At that time, we had about 2,500 employees. The plant process,  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:06:35):**  5,000 head of cattle a day. I mean, you know, it had a payroll of something like $60 million  
**[0:06:40-0:06:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:06:40):**  a year. I mean, it was an incredible operation doing really important work, in my opinion,  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:06:47):**  not just making food for the world over, but employing all of those people, keeping a town  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:06:53):**  prosperous, a town that without that plant might have struggled and failed like so many  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:06:59):**  little towns in this country have done, and also supporting farmers locally who raise  
**[0:07:04-0:07:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:07:04):**  cattle and need an outlet for them. So, boy, I mean, I still to this day, I'm dumbstruck  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:07:11):**  with gratitude for that opportunity. I really loved it. It was a high point in my life.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:07:17):**  Yeah. I remember the first abattoir I went through. It's this sort of unveiling of the  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:07:23):**  black box. Like, you know what happens in the beginning and you know what happens at  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:07:27):**  the end and you've just never seen the middle. And I remember going through the first plant  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:07:31):**  and it was actually a sheep abattoir and I was so fascinated. I had the same experience  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:07:36):**  of just the complexity and the human elements and the technology elements and the safety  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:07:42):**  elements. And it's really quite a fascinating operation that is often just a black box that  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:07:47):**  people don't see inside or let alone think about running and operating and managing all  
**[0:07:51-0:07:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:07:51):**  the complexities around. Yeah. I mean, there's really a, I'll say a sisterhood or a fraternity  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:07:59):**  of people who have had that experience, who have worked in those kinds of facilities or  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:08:04):**  who at least spent a lot of time in them because we understand and we know that there's something

**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:09:55):**  that people in American agriculture put into producing food for the world. And they're

**[0:10:16-0:10:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:10:16):**  We've seen a willingness to be transparent, a willingness to explain ourselves, explain

**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:10:40):**  it. And now we're actually even past that sort of initial transparency step. Now we're  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:10:46):**  almost to a consultative approach, I'll say.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:10:51):**  This journey hasn't always been easy. Back in the 90s, Oprah Winfrey discussed mad cow

**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:11:21):**  made of maybe a sort of not particularly well considered comment about our product. And  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:11:26):**  we, you know, let's absolutely fight this thing to the map.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:11:30):**  The industry was quickly changing though. Just a few years later, Oprah wanted to do  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:11:35):**  a show about how meat was produced, and they came to Cargill.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:11:39):**  They'd asked others in the industry, and the industry had said no, because she had this  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:11:44):**  history of having said one not positive thing about meat production, and now no one wanted  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:11:50):**  to do this show, no one wanted to participate, and they were going to let this program go  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:11:54):**  on where they were going to talk about meat production without anybody from the industry  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:11:59):**  providing a perspective or a counterpoint.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:12:02):**  So Cargill ultimately decided, you know, with a whole bunch of discussion, that we were  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:12:07):**  going to do the show. And so we did it, we either came through and filmed in our plant  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:12:11):**  in Colorado and then invited me to come back to the Oprah studio in Chicago for the in-studio  
**[0:12:17-0:12:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:12:17):**  portion of the discussion. And I found it to be a really balanced, careful conversation.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:12:25):**  Granted, you know, there were perspectives shared from vegans and people who disagreed  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:12:30):**  with eating meat or producing meat the way we produce it in the US, but the industry  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:12:35):**  was offered the opportunity to share its view, and we did, and it was reasonably well received,  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:12:40):**  actually.

**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:12:48):**  think was really important. And what the industry learned is that if you don't show up, no one  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:12:54):**  will tell your story. And if you react to questions or comments or maybe even not so  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:13:01):**  informed opinions with defensiveness and, you know, an aggressive posture, you're going

**[0:13:47-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:13:47):**  avoiding land conversion. That issue in particular has been driven by these NGOs and interest  
**[0:13:54-0:14:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:13:54):**  groups. And they took that issue to the brands first. And they said to the brands, you don't

**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:14:16):**  Let's learn and have dug into those kinds of issues and then have worked with their

**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:16:47):**  I run OSI's global McDonald's business, and I'm also at the same time OSI's chief sustainability

**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:17:16):**  So tell me about how the conversation with McDonald's, which you've been involved with  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:17:22):**  for a while, has changed around sustainability. McDonald's is such an interesting one because  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:17:26):**  I would say in the American view, at least they sometimes can be vilified, whether for

**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:17:37):**  there are many, many sides to the story. What's the sustainability conversation been like  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:17:42):**  with McDonald's over the years?

**[0:17:51-0:17:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:17:51):**  to what people who are involved in the work know is quite different when it comes to brands.

**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:18:06):**  person on the street likes their advertisements and thinks they're a force for good in the

**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:18:16):**  actually care. And the way you know if the brand cares about these issues is whether  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:18:22):**  they're willing to invest. So do they put their money where their mouth is? Do they

**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:18:38):**  high end products that are only available to some wealthy people? And I think the thing  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:18:44):**  that's always impressed me about the McDonald's company and its approach is that they change  
**[0:18:50-0:18:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:18:50):**  entire supply chains. So when they come in and they say, you know, we've reconsidered  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:18:57):**  how we feel about a certain production practice in animal agriculture and we would like a

**[0:19:19-0:19:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:19:19):**  McDonald's, only mass brands can change the world. These niche brands can change certain

**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:19:33):**  And that is where the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef comes in. Nicole founded  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:19:37):**  the U.S. branch of this group, which is made up of several mass suppliers such as OSI and  
**[0:19:42-0:19:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:19:42):**  Cargill, as well as producers, industry bodies and retailers such as McDonald's. The Global  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:19:49):**  Roundtable for Sustainable Beef was initially formed by a group of stakeholders who represented  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:19:54):**  different parts of the beef value chain, who wanted to come together and bring some harmony  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:20:00):**  to these discussions around sustainability related issues. It wasn't ever a one issue  
**[0:20:05-0:20:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:20:05):**  organization. It was always meant to address the holistic concept of sustainability. The  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:20:12):**  first thing we had to agree was that it doesn't really work to mandate a particular production  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:20:19):**  method or a particular practice for the reasons I've already said. The conditions are quite  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:20:24):**  different. The cattle themselves are quite different. The expectations of a community  
**[0:20:29-0:20:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:20:29):**  or the resources of a community vary so dramatically around the world. And the beauty of beef,  
**[0:20:36-0:20:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:20:36):**  of course, is that it can be produced in really diverse situations. That's the wonder of cattle.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:20:44):**  So we knew we didn't want to pick winners and losers. We didn't want to come out and  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:20:48):**  say, well, this production system is good, but this production system is bad. Because  
**[0:20:52-0:20:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:20:52):**  anyone with any kind of sophistication understands that that actually isn't true. So we wanted  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:20:59):**  to come up with these principles and criteria. And then we really wanted to charge the beef  
**[0:21:04-0:21:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:21:04):**  producing areas of the world with the task of going out and addressing what are the highest  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:21:11):**  priority issues in their area? What are the problems in their supply chains? What are  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:21:18):**  the solutions available to them? And encourage them to do that work on their own and then  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:21:24):**  come back and share the results of that with the global roundtable, which has worked out  
**[0:21:30-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:21:30):**  really well. So it's important not to tell beef producers around the world what to do,  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:21:38):**  because we all know people don't go into farming because they want to take orders. But it is  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:21:44):**  important to provide them an opportunity to discover things they don't know about their  
**[0:21:49-0:21:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:21:49):**  supply chains, reconsider practices or approaches based on input from others, and then share  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:21:57):**  their learnings so that we can all improve.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:22:00):**  I would say the biggest thing, and be curious if you agree or not, that's in the conversation  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:22:05):**  right now is the greenhouse gas footprint of beef production from enteric emissions  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:22:10):**  all the way through the supply chain. Was that a big part of the conversation in setting  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:22:15):**  up that roundtable or has that come to the forefront more recently?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:22:19):**  No, it always has been part of the conversation and a really important part of the conversation.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:22:24):**  But I think, let's say pre-COVID because COVID is so present at the moment that it obscures  
**[0:22:31-0:22:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:22:31):**  almost everything else. But pre-COVID about nine months ago, I would have said to you,  
**[0:22:38-0:22:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:22:38):**  it is the issue. So I think we've really seen an evolution in our understanding that all  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:22:46):**  aspects of beef sustainability are critical. All aspects of beef sustainability are important.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:22:51):**  But if we can't get this climate thing right, nothing else really is going to matter for  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:22:56):**  all kinds of reasons. One, because of the climate, but two, because of people's concerns  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:23:02):**  about beef and its impact on the climate. And if we can't address those concerns, we're  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:23:07):**  going to have a whole other issue.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:23:10):**  So tell me about some of the responses to that and maybe that gets into regenerative  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:23:13):**  agriculture a bit. And I guess the role of manufacturers like Cargill and OSI in that  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:23:19):**  supply chain. So I guess tell me about how Regen Ag has entered the conversation and  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:23:25):**  where that kind of fits into the broader sustainability picture.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:23:28):**  Well, I think the really cool thing that's coming out today is the ways that farmers  
**[0:23:34-0:23:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:23:34):**  and practices on farm can actually be sort of the climate heroes. And we are seeing a  
**[0:23:41-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:23:41):**  real interest in documenting the positive impacts that farming practices can have on  
**[0:23:49-0:23:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:23:49):**  climate. The ways that healthy soils, for example, can serve as a carbon sink. And how  
**[0:23:56-0:24:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:23:56):**  can you manage your soils and manage your grasses and manage your animals in a way to  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:24:03):**  provide ecosystem services to the planet, not just meat to the planet. And that is a  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:24:09):**  really cool thing that's going on right now. So I'm excited about that work, but that's  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:24:15):**  not the only work I'm excited about. I'm excited about the work that's being done to reduce  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:24:20):**  emissions in cattle with feed ration changes or other practices in how we feed the animals  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:24:26):**  and when we feed the animals that can have a positive impact on the emissions that they  
**[0:24:31-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:24:31):**  produce. And I want to say it's really important for me to say out loud that I personally believe  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:24:40):**  that beef production is good for the planet. I think beef production is good for our communities.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:24:47):**  I think it's good for, it's a net positive for people. And so I, that's my perspective.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:24:54):**  I know others don't share it. I get that, but I'm in the space that believes that. So  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:25:01):**  trying to figure out the ways to make it even better is my goal.

**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:27:19):**  care about? What are you working on this year? How could we support that? So one of the farms  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:27:25):**  that we work on is a operation, a beef operation in Australia, and they really care deeply  
**[0:27:31-0:27:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:27:31):**  about trees, about planting trees and healing, I'll say a farm that in one case they inherited

**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:27:44):**  so we can support that tree planting effort and at the same time promote the work they're  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:27:49):**  doing so that other farmers can learn from them.

**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:28:28):**  world, in Europe in particular, we have some programs where farmers are paid a premium  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:28:34):**  for producing beef that is, that meets certain sustainability standards. That's a really  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:28:40):**  cool program and we're really excited about that. In other parts of the world, that doesn't  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:28:44):**  seem to be possible, at least not today. So that's where you might say, you know, if somebody  
**[0:28:50-0:28:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:28:50):**  wants to plant trees, we can buy some trees, right? That kind of a straightforward direct

**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:29:13):**  get the knowledge that they want, we're helping to support those education programs.

**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:29:24):**  on that term? I noticed you haven't kind of used it, but what's your view on what can  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:29:29):**  otherwise be a polarizing or controversial term?  
**[0:29:32-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:29:32):**  Well, I'll give you the answer that I sometimes give when we get into questions about what  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:29:40):**  does the word sustainability mean? What does the word regenerative mean? Shouldn't we be  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:29:44):**  using a different word? Isn't there a better one? And then, you know, we all want to fight  
**[0:29:48-0:29:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:29:48):**  over semantics. I am out of the business of fighting over semantics. I did that. I'm a  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:29:55):**  middle aged lady now. I'm too old and tired to bicker over what we should call things.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:30:00):**  So I leave those questions to communications experts. They can decide what to call something  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:30:05):**  they can, and I'm happy to use whatever language anybody wants me to use. I'm about action.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:30:11):**  And I work in an industry that's about action. So if you're working on things that are improving  
**[0:30:18-0:30:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:30:18):**  sustainability outcomes for the production of food for people around the world, you're

**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:30:47):**  underpinning. Like if you're supporting tree planting, is there a measurement framework  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:30:52):**  around tons of carbon or CO2 equivalent sequestered? If you're doing sustainability sourcing, are

**[0:31:02-0:31:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:31:02):**  I really believe strongly that you have got to have data and science to back up your recommendations  
**[0:31:10-0:31:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:31:10):**  to farmers around the world. And that's because they are not playing with the house's money.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:31:17):**  They are betting their own money, their own livelihoods, their legacy for their children

**[0:33:05-0:33:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:33:05):**  diets for new kinds of foods. And if people enjoy plant-based proteins or even cell-based  
**[0:33:13-0:33:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/can-big-brands-like-mcdonalds-be-global-leaders-in-sustainability#t=0:33:13):**  meats and they want to make room in their diet for that, I say good luck and God bless.

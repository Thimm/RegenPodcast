**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:01:12):**  In the early days, they raised money from big name Silicon Valley investors such as

**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:01:23):**  players in a Canadian antitrust case.

**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:01:37):**  Well, as you're about to hear Charles explain, the idea for FBN was born when love forced  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:01:42):**  his Silicon Valley world to collide with rural Nebraska.

**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:01:48):**  I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area in Palo Alto, right in the heart of Silicon Valley.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:01:52):**  Always was very interested in technology and just, you know, out here, startups are kind

**[0:02:01-0:02:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:02:01):**  Cousins had started a company called the dazzle.com and was always just very interested in entrepreneurship.

**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:02:12):**  that I married into it because, you know, I was I was from an urban area from the Bay

**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:02:17):**  My wife is from central Nebraska, from Kearney, Nebraska.

**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:02:26):**  were getting out of college.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:02:27):**  And that was actually my first time on a real production commodity farm.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:02:32):**  So when at that time, I just became completely fascinated by farming, really knew nothing  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:02:39):**  about it before then, hadn't appreciated the life of a farm or the complexity of farming.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:02:45):**  In fact, it really never never registered for me.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:02:48):**  I kind of, you know, being from a big city and then going to school on the East Coast,

**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:02:55):**  So but when I spent time with Anthony, it just blew me away.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:02:59):**  It blew me away, blew me away how complex the job was, how much responsibility one person  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:05):**  has on a farm.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:07):**  And I ended up spending a corn harvest with him going around working, whatever I could  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:12):**  do, however I could be useful, I needed an excuse to be in Nebraska chasing my girlfriend  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:16):**  around.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:17):**  He had me, you know, driving the grain cart, helping them drive the combine.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:21):**  But you know, the daily life of a farm is something people really don't appreciate.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:25):**  You get up at, you know, 6am, and you're starting with feeding the cattle and mixing the feed  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:30):**  in the feed wagon, and then you're going out and fixing some pivots and moving irrigation  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:34):**  pipe.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:35):**  And then you're going out and preparing the tractor to haul the grain cart, and then you're  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:39):**  going and doing a little bit of harvesting if the weather's good.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:42):**  In the middle of all that, you're buying and selling commodities, you're managing input  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:48):**  purchases, you're dealing with being an entrepreneur, you're probably dealing with legal issues,  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:52):**  you're dealing with family issues that are also popping up, which also, you know, get  
**[0:03:56-0:03:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:56):**  into the business.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:57):**  So it's a remarkably complex job.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:04:00):**  And I just was utterly blown away by it.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:04:02):**  I had no appreciation of it, and had become, you know, fascinated by it ever since.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:04:09):**  Charles has painted a pretty accurate picture of what farming life can be like, and spending  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:04:13):**  time there piqued his interest in the industry.

**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:04:19):**  and going to Harvard Business School, he regularly traveled back to Nebraska and Kansas.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:04:24):**  There are a couple very notable early impressions that spending time on the farm really left  
**[0:04:30-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:04:30):**  me with.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:04:31):**  You know, one is, as I said, the complexity of the farm job.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:04:34):**  But number two was, you know, a story I tell a lot, which is, you know, riding around the

**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:04:52):**  And you go, what in the world does Brazil have to do with central Nebraska?

**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:05:17):**  And your livelihood is getting driven by forces totally beyond your control in this global

**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:07:00):**  didn't trust the people they did business with, and that there were these very basic

**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:07:11):**  the guys, you know, was basically requiring his seed dealer to say, hey, show me your

**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:07:21):**  I don't want to see your test plot.

**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:07:29):**  show him exactly how the seeds performed.

**[0:07:34-0:07:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:07:34):**  This is in Northern Illinois, for example.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:07:36):**  And they'd find these 20, 30 bushel swings in between their two farms, you know, in the  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:07:41):**  same region, just from better hybrid placement on soil types.

**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:07:52):**  information, why they wanted to be able to share data, and what was causing the root  
**[0:07:57-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:07:57):**  problems, it was fundamentally that the market and the industry would not or could not give

**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:08:14):**  place in the industry, the oligopoly nature of the industry, the extreme pricing power

**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:08:30):**  are generally sold out of the zone, what are called seed pricing zones, no seeds are sold  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:08:34):**  across state lines.

**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:08:41):**  And that situation, farmers had just kind of come to accept a little bit as this is  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:08:45):**  the way the world works.

**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:08:50):**  insiders, we, you know, Amol had been working in food and ag, obviously, he was a car dealer  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:08:54):**  as well.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:08:55):**  And, you know, I had my family's experiences.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:08:57):**  When you looked at it from the outside, you said, this makes absolutely no sense.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:01):**  It makes literally no sense.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:03):**  How can an industry be a $20 billion, $25 billion industry?  
**[0:09:07-0:09:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:07):**  You look at crop protection and seed in North America.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:09):**  And nobody puts a price on line.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:12):**  You know, nobody can actually show you how the seeds performing on other farms.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:16):**  Every seed company just makes claims about their plot trial where miraculously their  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:21):**  seeds always with, you know, so it was kind of ludicrous.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:25):**  But that had come to be the state of the world in agriculture.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:28):**  And so the early farmers in F.B.N. really honed in on these problems and really honed  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:33):**  in on the problems in the market.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:36):**  And then, you know, what I would say was sort of the founding insight of F.B.N. and, you  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:39):**  know, the starting point, which really just the position of the farmer in the farm economy  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:45):**  where the farmer is stuck between these oligopolists on either side.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:49):**  You have oligopoly players in ag, chem and seed and retail.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:53):**  And then on the other side of grain marketing and meatpacking.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:56):**  And then in the middle you have, you know, two million farms at an extreme information  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:00):**  disadvantage, an extreme market disadvantage, price disadvantage to those players.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:04):**  And consequently, they have the lowest profitability and do the most work, take the most risk and  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:10):**  get the least rewards.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:11):**  And so that was the core of F.B.N. and that digital networks and online networks were  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:18):**  the best ways to solve that.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:20):**  You know, in the past, people would create trade groups, trade associations or co-ops  
**[0:10:25-0:10:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:25):**  or things like that.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:26):**  But in the modern era, you would start with a network with an information system and create  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:30):**  a digitally connected ecosystem.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:33):**  And so that's where we started from.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:35):**  And, you know, the roots of that was that we also would be very, very customer focused.

**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:41):**  And we knew that we would end up building many platforms and pieces of F.B.N.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:46):**  The sequencing was maybe a little more in question.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:48):**  We didn't quite know the order in which we were going to start those things.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:52):**  But we knew that, you know, we would be very responsive to farmer needs.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:55):**  And so born out of that, listening to our growers really focusing on what their actual  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:00):**  problems were, not the problems we wanted to solve or the products we wanted to sell  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:04):**  them, but what was a fundamental problem in the market that they were really suffering  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:07):**  from, has really been at the genesis and root of F.B.N. since the beginning and has led  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:13):**  us to all the businesses that we've started on top of that platform.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:18):**  Which we'll definitely get into.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:19):**  I want to ask one more question about the early days.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:21):**  So you guys raised, I think, a four to five, four point six million Series A in 2014 from  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:27):**  Kleiner Perkins and then a year later, like 15 from Google Ventures or G.V.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:31):**  What were the conversations like about ag tech then?  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:34):**  Well, I think at that time there was a much smaller universe of people investing and it  
**[0:11:40-0:11:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:40):**  was, you know, almost nobody's full time job to look at ag tech or look at agriculture  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:47):**  and understand it.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:48):**  So I think for a lot of firms, it was probably more of a curiosity that they may have said,  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:53):**  you know, I'm not sure if I have the mental bandwidth to go try and understand agriculture.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:57):**  It's not like trying to understand enterprise SaaS where I can roll out of bed and there's  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:01):**  20 companies 10 minutes from here.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:03):**  I got a flight to Nebraska.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:04):**  That's a lot of work.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:05):**  I'm not sure I want to do that.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:06):**  So I think that, frankly, kept a lot of people from understanding just how important and  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:12):**  big and technological the ag industry was.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:16):**  And by a lot of people, I mean a lot of people in Silicon Valley and VCs and entrepreneurs.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:20):**  But, you know, we had the benefit of having some really great investors early who had  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:25):**  some experience in it.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:26):**  Right.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:27):**  And they had they had known a bit about it.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:28):**  So obviously the KP team through a mole and the work he had done.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:32):**  And then GV had done some investing as well.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:34):**  I think they had been involved in Climate Corp and a few others early.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:38):**  DBL, who got involved with us, which stands for Double Bottom Line Investors.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:43):**  They had been a very mission driven fund and we pitched them immediately upon creating  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:49):**  the company.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:50):**  And I think what resonated with them was our focus and mission on our our customers.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:55):**  And whereas they had done almost no food and ag investing at that time.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:59):**  So I think the reasons people were investing back then were a little different maybe than  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:03):**  now.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:04):**  It wasn't quite so much of a known class or an asset class.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:07):**  And there weren't quite as many dedicated funds.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:10):**  There may have been one or two and there have been some strategic funds.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:13):**  But it was a pretty different landscape at that time, for sure.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:17):**  One thing Charles quickly realized back then was that FBN would have to work like agriculture  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:21):**  does, as much or more than like Silicon Valley.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:25):**  So we always knew at a very visceral and personal level, you cannot work in agriculture remotely.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:34):**  And a whole lot of companies or startups, you know, at that time were based out here  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:39):**  or based in Silicon Valley or somewhere else.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:41):**  And and like, OK, I'm going to throw up a website and I've got this whizbang technology  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:45):**  and I'll and I'll and obviously farmers are going to want it and it's going to work.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:49):**  It's just not the way it works.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:51):**  It's not the way rural America works.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:52):**  It's not the way agriculture works.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:54):**  So so we knew that very early.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:56):**  Our first office was not in Silicon Valley.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:58):**  Our first office was in Davenport, Iowa.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:00):**  And before we ever even had an office, we were still squatting and just camped out working  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:07):**  sometimes in the Kleiner basement, sometimes at home here in California.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:11):**  Meanwhile we opened an office in Davenport, Iowa, because it was so important to be close  
**[0:14:15-0:14:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:15):**  to our farms and our customers.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:16):**  And our very first team members who we hired out there were in data processing and data  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:22):**  ops and then what became our customer group and our sales team.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:24):**  And a lot of those that that those first three or four people who opened our Davenport office  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:29):**  are still leaders in the company today, eight years later, which has been really fun.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:33):**  So always from the beginning, always at the core of the company was having a very close  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:38):**  contact with our farmers, a place where our farmers could come and visit and that we could  
**[0:14:43-0:14:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:43):**  talk to.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:44):**  And we spent huge amounts of time, even though we were based out here, we spent huge amounts  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:47):**  of time on the road, on farms, at trade shows, doing whatever we needed to do to have very  
**[0:14:52-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:52):**  close contact with the customers.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:54):**  So I think that was sort of first and most fundamentally.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:57):**  But also one of the best things we did was really think very hard about our culture at  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:02):**  the very beginning.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:03):**  And at the very beginning of a company, there are so many things that are immediate priorities  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:08):**  and life and death because you literally have to do everything.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:11):**  You have to go get it the main name, you have to deal with all the legal and preparation,  
**[0:15:16-0:15:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:16):**  you have to go start putting the product together.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:19):**  And there's just the list of tasks is very, very long.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:22):**  And so thinking about culture kind of feels like a little bit of a luxury where you think,  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:27):**  oh, my gosh, I can, you know, do we really have time to do this?

**[0:15:37-0:15:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:37):**  going to post and start recruiting to hire somebody.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:40):**  And we made ourselves sit down and say, what is this company?  
**[0:15:43-0:15:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:43):**  What are we all about?  
**[0:15:44-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:44):**  Who are we?  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:45):**  Who are the people that we want to be on this journey and on this team?  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:48):**  And that really, again, went back to farmers, and it went back to our customers.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:53):**  And that, especially in the early days of the company, but you know, it's just as relevant  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:57):**  today, folks had to be on board for the mission.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:00):**  And they had to be interested and passionate about this world and want to work for this  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:04):**  customer and be ready to do whatever it takes to solve farmers problems.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:10):**  And we kind of instantiate that, incorporate that in our kind of farmers first mentality.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:16):**  And you know, our farm born, what we said was, you know, farm born values of our employees,  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:20):**  which fundamentally meant just getting stuff done, you know, thinking like a farmer, you  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:24):**  know, if it takes baling wire and chewing gum to, you know, fix something, we're going  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:29):**  to do it not accepting, you know, failure, farms just have to make stuff happen.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:34):**  Products got to get done, stuff has to get harvested, same thing, products got to get  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:37):**  released, things have to get done.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:39):**  So having that kind of farmer work ethic, farmer mentality, also just culturally, it  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:43):**  was very important to us that if a farmer walked into our office or a farmer ever came  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:48):**  in, they felt like they're coming to somewhere they that resonated with them, you know, was  
**[0:16:53-0:16:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:53):**  authentic to them.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:54):**  And that one came very important to us as well.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:56):**  I think at the time, there was a funny story we used to tell, which was that I think Dropbox  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:00):**  had a decoration of a panda, it was like a statue in the front of their office, they  
**[0:17:05-0:17:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:05):**  spent something like $100,000 on this statue.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:08):**  I don't know if that's actually true or not.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:10):**  But that was the story.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:11):**  And, you know, it was just like, okay, we know we're not going to be that.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:15):**  Because, you know, can you imagine what how a farmer would feel if they walk into your  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:20):**  office, and you have a hundred thousand dollar Panda in your front of your office.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:25):**  So there's a lot of the culture in Silicon Valley and the culture of startups, which,  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:28):**  you know, I've been at Google, and Google had more perks than you can possibly imagine.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:32):**  And as a as a workplace, if they felt that you're working in that environment, and here  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:37):**  I am, I'm out in the muck and the freezing cold or working cattle, and you guys are back  
**[0:17:42-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:42):**  in this cush office.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:43):**  So so that was kind of first and foremost is that farmers had to feel comfortable with  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:46):**  the company and with the employees.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:49):**  And that was just as true in Davenport, Iowa, as it was in Silicon Valley.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:52):**  And in fact, we did have farmers walking off the street in Silicon Valley, it's really  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:56):**  funny.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:57):**  And lo and behold, some people are on vacation and some other people in the area of land  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:01):**  walked in off the street.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:03):**  And you never would have thought, you know, farmers walking off the street in San Carlos,  
**[0:18:07-0:18:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:07):**  but we did have it happen.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:08):**  So that was really important.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:09):**  And actually, our early offices were were kind of a great cultural touch point for the  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:15):**  company.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:16):**  You know, our very first office was in a garage and was in kind of a converted architects  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:21):**  studio garage in San Carlos, next to a paint factory.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:25):**  It was really pretty grim and had one bathroom and it was no conference room and you had  
**[0:18:30-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:30):**  to you had to grid it out to be there.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:33):**  And then we finally moved to a strip mall and a strip converted office in a strip mall.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:38):**  And that was a such a big step up.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:40):**  We felt like we're such a grown up company because now we had two bathrooms, we had a  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:44):**  men's and a women's bathroom.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:45):**  We had a kitchen, we had all these things that were, wow, we're really getting to the  
**[0:18:50-0:18:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:50):**  big time now.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:51):**  And we were wedged between a children's dance studio and a used furniture shop in the strip  
**[0:18:57-0:18:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:57):**  mall in San Carlos.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:58):**  That was kind of a kind of a down and out strip, not down and out.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:01):**  But I'd say it had seen better days and was going through a revival.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:04):**  And we were occupying one of the offices.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:06):**  And so you'd have a lot of employees who would come by doing job interviews, and they would  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:10):**  come to the office, and they'd look around and they go, oh, like, I'm gonna go work at,  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:16):**  you know, Google or Facebook or one of these places, or, you know, Survey Monkey, where,  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:21):**  you know, the just the perks are outrageous.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:24):**  And we did have we did plenty of candidates who, you know, came to the office that, nope,  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:28):**  not for me.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:30):**  And then you had people come and go, yes, this is precisely what I want.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:35):**  This is it.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:36):**  This is a startup.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:37):**  This is the ground floor.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:38):**  And the values are in the right place.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:40):**  The money is not in the office, the money is in the customers and the technology, figuring  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:43):**  out how to build the business.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:45):**  And you can see how we were prioritizing what our values are, where our focus was.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:50):**  And that really was great as a filter for getting the right people in the company.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:57):**  It didn't make it easier to hire, for sure, because we were in, we were kind of not on  
**[0:20:01-0:20:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:20:01):**  the main line.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:20:02):**  We were not in, you know, downtown San Francisco or Palo Alto, we were trying to hire engineers.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:20:07):**  But when you came and you saw it, you had to, you knew what you're getting involved

**[0:21:39-0:21:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:21:39):**  You know, if you go to Washington or something like that, but you know, otherwise we're the

**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:21:47):**  show or at a farm in Nebraska or North Dakota.

**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:21:57):**  get through and everyone's a bit of a generalist, often kind of wearing a few different hats.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:02):**  How has your role as you know, you've moved from founder into to CIO now, like what are  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:08):**  some of the things you've taken on and how has your role in the different hats you've  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:11):**  had to wear changed?  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:12):**  Yeah, so for me, you know, I let our product and technical, you know, build out in the  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:18):**  early days and then after about a year getting the product launched, we had to start figuring  
**[0:22:23-0:22:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:23):**  out how to launch the company and actually get into the market.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:26):**  So then I took on the marketing aspects and then ran the marketing for several years as  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:30):**  well.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:31):**  And then, you know, you grow and mature and we brought in a terrific CMO.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:35):**  And then now my focus is going back and figuring out the next frontiers for FBM, just sort  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:40):**  of being the entrepreneur within the startup and looking back for, you know, new ideas,  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:45):**  new concepts, new markets to apply the FBM platform.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:47):**  But it's an ongoing journey.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:49):**  I think things change a lot and you have to, anybody who joined a startup at any, in any  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:54):**  role or any capacity or any stage has to understand that things are going to change and things  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:59):**  are going to change a fair amount.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:01):**  But that adaptability and grip is a key component for anyone in any role.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:06):**  And I think if people join startups and think things are going to be super stagnant and  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:10):**  I'm going to do this and go from level one, level two, level three, that's not the way  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:14):**  it goes in the early days of a company.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:16):**  But as you get later and later and more mature, then you have to start building up that kind  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:20):**  of process and career progression.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:22):**  How have you had to change along that journey?  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:25):**  You know, different roles, different hats, different responsibilities.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:29):**  Have you had to change aspects of how you think about the world?  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:32):**  Well, roles change and adapt as you grow.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:36):**  And in the very early phases, things are more conceptual.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:39):**  You're developing and testing your product for the first time.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:42):**  You're talking to your first few customers and then you're trying to figure out how to  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:45):**  scale.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:46):**  And then you're trying to figure out how to get the right people on the team to create  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:48):**  the infrastructure that scales and the leadership that scales.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:52):**  And you're constantly going through that evolution in all the aspects of the business.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:57):**  And you know, at any given time in FBM, we have businesses that are fully mature, that  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:02):**  are what we would consider mature.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:03):**  Like we know how to run them and they're up and running and we've got good product market  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:07):**  fit and they're scaling and they're growing.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:09):**  And then we have businesses that are very immature, that are brand new or incubations  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:13):**  or new products spun off a business.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:16):**  And I think for everybody that tests, you know, how you can kind of range from the early  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:24):**  phase of a concept where it's a little more isolated as you're developing something and  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:30):**  it's a little more one-to-one to then figuring out how to build an organization, a team and  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:34):**  technology and a business offering that can scale and building around that.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:38):**  And so I think that's something that all our teams go through.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:42):**  We're going a little bit back and forth, but that's the fun of it.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:47):**  Any mistakes that you've made along the way or things that looking back you sort of say,  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:51):**  I wish in power of hindsight, I had done that differently and learned a good lesson?  
**[0:24:57-0:24:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:57):**  Oh sure.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:59):**  There are many.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:02):**  I have to think of them.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:03):**  I think ultimately a lot of the things really come down to people and having the right people

**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:10):**  As I said, you have a lot of generalists and you have to figure out when you need to make  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:15):**  the transition in roles to specialists.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:18):**  And I think for any manager also, you really just want to be bringing in people who are  
**[0:25:23-0:25:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:23):**  better at that job than you are.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:25):**  So if you're a generalist at the beginning and you're doing something that's more of  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:29):**  a stretch, then you really want to be quickly hiring someone who's vastly better at that  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:33):**  than you are because that's going to make the whole company better off.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:37):**  So I think a whole lot of the kind of things that we might say, Hey, we should have done  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:41):**  A versus B, come down to those kinds of dynamics as well.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:45):**  Do you have any advice for someone hiring someone who is meant to be better at the role  
**[0:25:49-0:25:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:49):**  than they are?  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:50):**  Like it can be hard to assess, especially if it's a technical role or a specialist role  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:53):**  where you're like, if they're better than me, then I'm not going to be able to assess  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:57):**  the quality of the exercise they complete in this interview process.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:00):**  Any kind of tips for how you actually figure out that they are better at that role or in  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:04):**  that specialty?  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:06):**  I mean, certainly it's different hiring technically, I mean, real truly technical roles than it  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:10):**  is hiring other sort of business roles.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:13):**  But as far as I was concerned at FBN, one of the greatest days of my life at FBN was  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:17):**  the day we hired Ed Rowe, our CTO, because I had been the CTO for a few months and I  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:22):**  knew I was not, that was not where I belong, but it's what you have to do to get the company  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:28):**  where it is and put together.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:30):**  And with Ed, we had a lot of great advisors and around FBN.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:35):**  And so at the very beginning, even before we had a real team, we had partners, friends,  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:40):**  folks who had been product managers, been CTOs, been, you know, VP as a product as well,  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:45):**  who were friends of the company.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:48):**  And they really help you through that process.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:50):**  When you have a skillset that is truly beyond your skillset, like evaluating someone's technical  
**[0:26:55-0:26:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:55):**  chops.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:56):**  You know, he immediately just made a immediate transformation in the company, started bringing  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:00):**  over really top tier talent, some of our great early engineers.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:04):**  And that just really created a sea change in our technical development and velocity.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:09):**  But there's a myriad of those kind of functions.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:11):**  But I think if you're getting into areas that you feel or skillsets you feel you don't understand  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:16):**  or you don't know as well, or you don't quite know how to judge, you have to go out to get  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:21):**  advice and get consultation from others.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:24):**  But then, you know, ultimately, is this person a fit, you know, whether or not their skills  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:28):**  are there, is this person a fit for the company?  
**[0:27:31-0:27:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:31):**  Are they fit culturally?  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:32):**  Do they really care about it?  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:33):**  You know, some people just want to pass the interview.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:37):**  Some people get into an interview, and it's kind of like passing a test.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:41):**  And people are competitive and ambitious by nature, and they want to get through the test.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:46):**  But you know, do they really want to be here?  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:48):**  And are they ready to go to North Dakota in winter to go talk to farmers, you know, at  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:53):**  the drop of a hat?  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:54):**  And so you really have to try and filter for that as hard as you can, because ultimately,  
**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:59):**  that's going to be the test of, you know, someone's going to be really successful here.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:03):**  Yeah, and it goes back to what you said about values, right?  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:05):**  Like knowing who you guys are and what it actually means to be successful at FBN and  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:10):**  to align with customers.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:12):**  One of the other things you mentioned is not wanting to build the profile of the founders.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:16):**  I mean, you've done very few interviews about your personal journey.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:19):**  I'm all the same.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:21):**  There's yet this kind of Silicon Valley trope of like, oh, the founders and putting them  
**[0:28:25-0:28:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:25):**  up on this pedestal and the journey they're going on.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:27):**  You guys have largely avoided that.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:29):**  Tell me about that decision and any regret on that or any exciting interviews you otherwise  
**[0:28:32-0:28:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:32):**  turned down that you, you know, profile building you could have done?  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:35):**  No, no, I just I just think it goes back to the having the right values and the values  
**[0:28:41-0:28:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:41):**  that kind of are important to your customers and that matter to your team and in your market.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:48):**  And, you know, I think so much of the Silicon Valley narrative when people raise money or  
**[0:28:56-0:28:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:56):**  when people start companies is just founder obsessed.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:59):**  For us, that's that's kind of just not who we are and it's kind of not our personalities.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:04):**  And we didn't really see the benefit in it.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:07):**  You know, it's vastly more important to make sure that folks understand the problem of  
**[0:29:12-0:29:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:12):**  our customers and the problem of farmers out there.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:15):**  That's generally the challenge of getting attention onto these problems versus getting  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:20):**  attention onto ourselves.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:22):**  So in Silicon Valley or in the business press, you see very little about agriculture.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:27):**  I mean, there's really only a couple reporters at national publications like The Wall Street  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:32):**  Journal or Bloomberg or maybe Washington Post or somebody who kind of moonlights in The  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:36):**  New York Times might have a food person, but they don't have an ag person.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:40):**  And so they don't report on largely what's going on in rural America or rural Canada  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:46):**  when you get outside the ag trade publications.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:49):**  And so the idea that those kind of publications or the business press or the tech press wants  
**[0:29:52-0:29:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:52):**  to come in and wants to talk about VCs and founders is also kind of insulting because  
**[0:29:59-0:30:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:59):**  there's a population out there who are our constituents or our customers and they have  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:05):**  very real lives and very real problems and are largely ignored.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:09):**  And it's one of the reasons why you've got these big urban rural divides in America,

**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:15):**  And you know, I think it's one of our jobs to get focus on them.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:19):**  And then if we can get focus on them from a media and from a policy standpoint, then  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:23):**  we're helping the problem.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:25):**  So I don't know, that's kind of also a big part of it.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:27):**  It just feels like, you know, look in our constituency, it's just not there.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:32):**  It's not the right thing to do to be sitting there and collecting accolades versus going  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:36):**  out and trying to get the attention on the problems of consolidation and lack of transparency  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:42):**  and lack of competition, the oligopoly pricing power, the struggles that farm families face.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:47):**  Have you ever gotten pushback on that from investors who are like, hey, you know, you  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:51):**  really need to be building the profile of the company more or getting into, I don't  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:55):**  know, more tech crunch or whatever silly things they might want you to do?  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:00):**  Not really.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:01):**  I would say, you know, mainly because, you know, I think a lot of companies and in Silicon  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:06):**  Valley, I think one of the reasons that a lot of that happens is that it's for fundraising  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:10):**  or for future fundraising and it's for profile building.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:13):**  And it's kind of also for marketing and how companies get marketing early in the life  
**[0:31:19-0:31:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:19):**  of the company.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:20):**  You raise the series A and you get on tech brunch and you get an article and there's

**[0:31:28-0:31:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:28):**  know, looking at a picture at a window.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:29):**  Right.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:30):**  And you look that way.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:31):**  And that has become a trope.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:33):**  And I think it just it serves a purpose in certain markets.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:39):**  It serves a purpose when you're a tech platform trying to generate users quickly and the other

**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:57):**  They want to know why you're doing what you're doing.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:59):**  They want to know what the company is all about.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:32:02):**  That's the story we want to tell.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:32:03):**  And that's the story we tell as FBN.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:32:05):**  And FBN must be doing something right, at the very least in the eyes of investors.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:32:09):**  It's one of the most well-funded ag tech startups.

**[0:32:16-0:32:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:32:16):**  to more than eight hundred and seventy million dollars with a valuation just shy of four

**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:32:32):**  from the other days in the last round, BlackRock, you really just got a tremendous group of  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:32:38):**  long term patient, very financially savvy investors who understand the FBN business,  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:32:43):**  understand the financial strength behind it and are here for us and with us for the long

**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:32:50):**  We're able to execute while we're raising, which is something that's really hard in the  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:32:55):**  early days of a company.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:32:57):**  When you go through a fundraise, especially in the early days, everything kind of stops  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:01):**  for several weeks, several months.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:03):**  Fundraising can be a giant distraction.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:05):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:06):**  We talk about a like post-raise hangover that happens when the whole team sort of shifts  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:10):**  focus in the early days to focus on the fundraising.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:13):**  Then you've got to get back to running the business and all these things that you said  
**[0:33:15-0:33:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:15):**  weren't as important.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:16):**  You've now got to make important again.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:18):**  And that shift can be pretty challenging, but obviously wouldn't be the case at your  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:21):**  guys' scale.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:22):**  So one of the other aspects of the raise was the collaboration with ADM.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:26):**  Tell me a little bit about this collaboration.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:28):**  What are some of the benefits of it and what does this mean?  
**[0:33:32-0:33:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:32):**  Yeah, so this is really exciting.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:34):**  So first of all, FBN is now at a scale where we have about 34,000 farmer members around  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:40):**  the US, Canada, Australia, and an increasingly sophisticated technology called FBN Gradable,  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:45):**  which is a platform that a grain buyer can use to transact, settle and perform record  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:51):**  keeping around grain transactions.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:53):**  And then a farmer sells to the Gradable system via the FBN app.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:57):**  So for a farmer, they can use it to sell grain as well as manage all their transactional  
**[0:34:01-0:34:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:01):**  record keeping.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:02):**  Now, Gradable does something else, which is that it also integrates with FBN analytics  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:07):**  and therefore contracts sustainability attributes associated with the crop.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:11):**  So a big part of what we're focused on with ADM is developing sustainable markets for  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:16):**  grain, developing more premium end markets for low carbon, for carbon credits, as well  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:20):**  as for other premium attributes and environmental services that can be associated with the crop  
**[0:34:25-0:34:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:25):**  that can be tracked and managed through the Gradable platform.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:27):**  So it's really tremendously exciting.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:29):**  So that's a major, major focus is doing sustainability at scale.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:33):**  Then there's some other really exciting parts as well that we're going to be working on  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:36):**  looking at how we bring out, which would be bringing more ADM product on the input side,  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:41):**  their fertilizers, nutrition, animal health, animal feed products out to our members.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:46):**  And a lot of those products and inputs are very tied to the point of manufacture.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:51):**  So they can be difficult to ship, very costly to ship.

**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:59):**  So that's another one where by providing and having access to the infrastructure of ADM  
**[0:35:04-0:35:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:04):**  behind the FBN e-commerce platform allows us to serve more farmers closer to their farms  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:10):**  at much more affordable levels and pass on more savings back to the farm.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:14):**  Yeah, it is so true of like ag tech, right?  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:17):**  That there's so many things you can do with digitization and in the digital world, but  
**[0:35:21-0:35:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:21):**  ultimately we're talking about a physical world where you've got to grow things and  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:25):**  transport them and store them.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:26):**  And so I think a lot of our commentary on the ag tech space as a company and as a podcast  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:31):**  has been around the, like you can't eat software, but you need both.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:34):**  And that's, what's exciting about the future.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:36):**  Did you imagine all along that you would have a partnership like this?  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:39):**  Some of the early FBN kind of approach was around disrupting the system versus partnering  
**[0:35:43-0:35:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:43):**  and working with it.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:44):**  Has that philosophy changed at all?  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:47):**  Well, I don't think the philosophy's really changed much at all.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:51):**  I mean, we're very, very focused on farmers and how do we make farmers more profitable  
**[0:35:55-0:35:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:55):**  and how do we make them more profitable with the power of the network?  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:58):**  And sometimes that means a very deep disruption of parts of the agricultural system.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:02):**  And sometimes that's done in collaboration, certainly with farm financing, you need financing  
**[0:36:07-0:36:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:07):**  partners.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:08):**  If you're going to be selling grain, that's got to go to a physical facility.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:11):**  You do need off-taking partners and merchandising partners in the market.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:14):**  You need logistics partners.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:16):**  So you do have to partner in agriculture, but ag is very large.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:21):**  And I think one thing people have said about the fundraiser, oh, is FBN not disrupting  
**[0:36:27-0:36:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:27):**  anymore?  
**[0:36:28-0:36:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:28):**  I said, absolutely not.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:29):**  If anything, this is tremendously exciting because we have a great partner in ADM supporting  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:33):**  the mission of FBN, the technology and platform of FBN and how we work with farmers to drive  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:38):**  even more benefits to the farm.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:40):**  So I think the combination is much stronger and much more capable of doing that disruption  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:46):**  at scale, which is tremendously exciting for the benefit of farmers and for the benefit  
**[0:36:50-0:36:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:50):**  of a competitive ag market, which is what farmers need.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:53):**  Has that been the response from farmers?  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:56):**  Well, I mean, I think you've seen some of that in some of the ag press, but that's different  
**[0:37:01-0:37:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:01):**  from farmers.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:03):**  And I think farmers understand that, hey, I got to sell my grain somewhere.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:07):**  My grain's got to go to a facility and they understand that.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:10):**  And by the way, this doesn't preclude us from working with others in the market, especially  
**[0:37:14-0:37:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:14):**  on the merchandising side.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:16):**  So we have many partners.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:17):**  We've been of a deep partnership with Poet Ethanol for their facilities around sustainability  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:21):**  as well that has been in the works, that we've been had for some time.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:25):**  So ag is broad and farmers' needs are broad.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:28):**  So you have to be adaptable as a company to figure out how you best serve your customer.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:34):**  But carving out new markets and partnerships hasn't always been easy for FBN.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:38):**  Like in Canada, as I said before, the Competition Bureau is investigating whether the big seed  
**[0:37:43-0:37:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:43):**  and chem companies have been boycotting FBM.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:46):**  And as a relatively new player in the very well-established ag scene, Charles says his  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:50):**  team soon figured out they had to take control of the company's story.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:54):**  You know, relying on other folks to carry your message.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:57):**  In some of the early days of FBN, we were going to go speak at some conferences or some  
**[0:38:03-0:38:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:03):**  actually trade associations or grower associations who invited us to come speak.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:07):**  We'd send them our presentation, you know, because we talk about consolidation and competition  
**[0:38:12-0:38:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:12):**  and price transparency in the market.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:14):**  And they say, you can't say this.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:16):**  You can't present that at our event.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:18):**  And we'd say, well, what do you mean?  
**[0:38:20-0:38:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:20):**  And they'd say, well, you know, these are our sponsors.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:23):**  You can't talk about this.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:24):**  And I said, well, what does that have to do with your members?  
**[0:38:27-0:38:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:27):**  Your members are all farmers.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:29):**  And they said, well, no, we don't want to deal with that.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:32):**  And you know, these are our sponsors, our sponsors will be upset.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:34):**  So no, you can't say this.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:35):**  So we didn't go to those events and speak.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:38):**  So it was really kind of eye opening.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:39):**  You thought, you know, that all parties, you know, have the same interest for farmers and  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:45):**  communicating issues openly and transparently to farmers.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:49):**  And it's just simply not the case.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:50):**  So that led us to say, all right, we need our own event.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:53):**  We need our own conference.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:54):**  We created farmer to farmer, which we ran up until COVID and hope to bring back here  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:58):**  this year with thousands of farmers coming because you needed an independent voice.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:02):**  Where you could speak directly to your customer.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:04):**  We did our own publishing and did our own writing.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:07):**  So there are just, you know, many cases where you think, well, obviously everyone's going  
**[0:39:11-0:39:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:11):**  to see the world the way we do because these things are very obvious when you look at the  
**[0:39:16-0:39:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:16):**  data.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:17):**  But no, there may be many, many conflicting interests in that system.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:20):**  Another great one, you know, early on was similarly is you kind of, you want things  
**[0:39:24-0:39:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:24):**  to be easier than they are.

**[0:39:30-0:39:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:30):**  You want, you hope there's going to be a big distribution deal that makes everything easy.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:34):**  You're going to build your software and someone else is going to sell it and they're going

**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:40):**  And so we had some funny examples in the early days where we were building our analytics  
**[0:39:44-0:39:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:44):**  platform, which is our first product.

**[0:39:49-0:39:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:49):**  They say, oh, the seed finder technology, this is great.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:51):**  We want all our members to be able to see this.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:54):**  We'd say, OK, great, you know, let's we'll go help you sign them up.  
**[0:39:57-0:39:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:57):**  They say, well, there's one big condition.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:59):**  We only want them to see the products that we sell.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:40:01):**  We don't want to see any of the competing products.

**[0:40:12-0:40:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:40:12):**  It's an open system with crowdsourcing and farmers get to learn from others participating  
**[0:40:18-0:40:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:40:18):**  and it makes everyone better off when that happens.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:40:20):**  So so very quickly you realize, OK, well, those folks, you know, they're not going to  
**[0:40:24-0:40:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:40:24):**  be able to communicate to growers what needs to be communicated.

**[0:40:47-0:40:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:40:47):**  We didn't have a brochure.

**[0:40:56-0:40:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:40:56):**  I don't think a single one of them ever got to a farm.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:40:59):**  And it just goes to, you know, the story of you know, you really just can't rely, especially  
**[0:41:05-0:41:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:05):**  in the early days, on someone else to tell your story.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:07):**  If your story has something that is about it, that's very unique, very special and you

**[0:41:22-0:41:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:22):**  And when you rely on other people to do it, it's just never going to get there in the  
**[0:41:25-0:41:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:25):**  way you want it to or you need it to.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:28):**  Those are great examples.

**[0:41:36-0:41:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:36):**  in the world or else, you know, we wouldn't be working on it.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:38):**  We obviously both love it and are really passionate about it not having come from it.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:41):**  One of the interesting things I find is how do you strike this balance between absolute  
**[0:41:46-0:41:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:46):**  appreciation, admiration and inspiration of why it works the way it does and understanding  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:50):**  that, you know, you do need facilities and that there are generations of experience and  
**[0:41:54-0:41:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:54):**  that is really tough and complex and absolute respect for that with also being able to question,  
**[0:41:59-0:42:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:59):**  you know, why things are the way they are and we might need to do them differently or  
**[0:42:02-0:42:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:02):**  challenge the status quo.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:04):**  Is that kind of tension something that you've felt or does that resonate with you?  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:09):**  Well, I think there's certain realities of moving physical goods around like in agriculture  
**[0:42:15-0:42:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:15):**  where these are you know, you're shipping things.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:18):**  Those things often weigh into tons.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:20):**  If you're dealing with commodities or feeds or hay, you know, that's low value and it  
**[0:42:24-0:42:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:24):**  has to go be conveyed in certain ways.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:26):**  So there's certain physical realities in farming.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:28):**  You can't get around.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:30):**  But in terms of and there's a lot of reasons why the industry has evolved the way it has,  
**[0:42:35-0:42:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:35):**  but some of those are due to intellectual property and licensing that has allowed companies  
**[0:42:39-0:42:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:39):**  to control markets like seed.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:41):**  But I think, you know, as far as for challenging the status quo, you have to look at the customer  
**[0:42:45-0:42:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:45):**  and you have to look at the farmer and see, you know, when you look from the outside in  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:49):**  and you say, why on earth is there a market the size of seed and chemical that has no  
**[0:42:54-0:42:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:54):**  prices online and that where products can't be distributed across, you know, are sold  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:59):**  across county lines without these zone pricing rules?  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:03):**  That's absurd.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:04):**  And from a consumer standpoint, it's outrageous.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:06):**  And so the farmer, the industry may have evolved for certain reasons, but that doesn't mean  
**[0:43:11-0:43:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:11):**  that it's right.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:12):**  And that doesn't mean that it exists in a way that really truly benefits the farmer  
**[0:43:16-0:43:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:16):**  from a consumer standpoint as a consumer and their needs as a consumer.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:20):**  So that's really important.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:21):**  You just have to keep your customer front and center.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:23):**  And that that keeps you focused on the right thing.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:27):**  Thank you.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:28):**  That makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:29):**  There's some big trends in the industry.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:30):**  You mentioned carbon and obviously sustainability is one.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:33):**  I would say two others that we've been talking about a lot.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:35):**  One would be like biologicals and new forms of inputs.

**[0:43:42-0:43:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:42):**  or partial automation or moving into full automation.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:45):**  How are you seeing those trends evolve and any comments on on FBN's role in either of  
**[0:43:49-0:43:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:49):**  those two trends or shifts?  
**[0:43:51-0:43:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:51):**  I think there's a lot of exciting trends, especially around automation, robotics on  
**[0:43:56-0:44:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:56):**  the farm and what that's going to bring, how quickly exactly they get out is, of course,  
**[0:44:02-0:44:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:02):**  the issue.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:03):**  If you were having this podcast seven years ago, it would have been primarily around drones.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:08):**  And everyone was talking about how drones would be a 90 billion dollar market.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:12):**  I mean, literally, the drone industry said it was going to be a 90 billion dollar market  
**[0:44:15-0:44:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:15):**  in agriculture back in 2013, 2014.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:18):**  So, you know, very hard to hard to predict how these things actually get adopted.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:23):**  But fundamentally, they all have to prove their their ROI and utility onto the farm  
**[0:44:28-0:44:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:28):**  and to the farmer, make it easy and very easy case.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:31):**  I'm particularly excited about some of the robotic applications I've seen.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:34):**  There's a great company, Burrow, who brought their robot to farmer to farmer.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:38):**  They found tremendous early adoption in the fresh market and fruit and vegetable crops  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:43):**  by focusing on very simple applications and very simple utility applications of a robot  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:48):**  that can follow a worker and help a worker pack and be more labor efficient.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:53):**  That's a much more straightforward task than trying to build a fully autonomous tractor  
**[0:44:57-0:44:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:57):**  system from the outset.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:58):**  So I think there's going to be a number of incredible innovations.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:01):**  There's no doubt that these are coming and that these are going to get onto the farm  
**[0:45:06-0:45:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:06):**  over the next decade or two decades.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:08):**  And we want to be testing them with our growers at the forefront of it.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:11):**  You know how quickly they take off really depends on how well those technologies prove  
**[0:45:15-0:45:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:15):**  the ROI on the farm so that the farmer feels the true return and has the willingness to  
**[0:45:20-0:45:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:20):**  pay.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:21):**  Awesome.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:22):**  So I know we're at a time here, Charles, but would you say you're as bullish on ag as you  
**[0:45:27-0:45:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:27):**  ever have been and as excited, you know, if you zoom all the way back to the beginning  
**[0:45:30-0:45:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:30):**  of the conversation, your first time on a farm, kind of being fascinated by this complex  
**[0:45:34-0:45:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:34):**  industry.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:35):**  Are you glad that you've ended up in agriculture?  
**[0:45:37-0:45:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:37):**  And are you going to spend the rest of your career working in this space?  
**[0:45:40-0:45:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:40):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:41):**  I mean, I think the future is probably, you know, it's never been brighter from a technology  
**[0:45:47-0:45:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:47):**  standpoint and from a lot of the business innovations that we've been able to bring  
**[0:45:51-0:45:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:51):**  out there.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:52):**  So I think you go back to when we were created, when we started huge problems in consolidation,  
**[0:45:56-0:46:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:56):**  huge problems in anti-competitive behavior and huge problems in the lack of transparency.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:46:02):**  Those are all things FBN has taken head on sometimes to a lot of controversy in the industry,  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:46:08):**  not controversial with farmers, but controversial with the incumbents, which tends to be the  
**[0:46:13-0:46:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:46:13):**  right equation.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:46:14):**  You don't want to be controversial with your customers, but you want to be if the incumbents  
**[0:46:18-0:46:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:46:18):**  are your persona non grata with the incumbents, that means you're doing something of value  
**[0:46:24-0:46:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:46:24):**  for your customers.

**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:46:30):**  by the incumbents.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:46:31):**  But, you know, FBN has been able to have a real impact on the market.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:46:34):**  It's one of the things that drives the industry crazy.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:46:37):**  We have changed the way some seed is marketed and sold by our seed relabeling work that

**[0:46:47-0:46:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:46:47):**  And, you know, we've been quantitatively able to show when FBN is selling a product or selling  
**[0:46:51-0:46:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:46:51):**  a generic alternative to a product, how the price of that product is lower across all  
**[0:46:55-0:47:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:46:55):**  farms in Canada and in the United States simply by us being in the market.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:47:01):**  So very, very proud of what the FBN team has accomplished so far and the impact we've been  
**[0:47:06-0:47:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:47:06):**  able to have for farmers.

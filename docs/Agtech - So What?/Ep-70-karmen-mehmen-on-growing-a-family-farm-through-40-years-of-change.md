**[0:00:09-0:00:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:00:09):**  Today's guest joins us from Iowa, where Carmen Maiman and her husband have been farming since  
**[0:00:15-0:00:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:00:15):**  1976.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:00:17):**  Their farm, MBS Family Farms, has grown over that time from 160 acres and 40 cows to an

**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:00:28):**  And Carmen has played a key role in that growth.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:00:32):**  She's an operator, the head of finance, a grain marketer, and so, so much more, as you'll  
**[0:00:38-0:00:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:00:38):**  hear.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:00:39):**  We talk about her journey in farming over the last nearly 45 years, including what she's  
**[0:00:44-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:00:44):**  learned about technology, business, and people.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:00:47):**  But Carmen didn't originally want to be a farmer.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:00:51):**  We jump in with how she found herself on a farm in a world that in some ways is quite  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:00:56):**  a bit different, and yet in some ways is the same as things are today.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:01):**  Well, I graduated from the high school just about three or four miles from here and married  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:08):**  my high school sweetheart, graduated in May of 1976, and got married in August.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:14):**  So I always thought that I would go to college, wanted to go to Iowa State, be a home-act  
**[0:01:19-0:01:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:19):**  teacher.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:20):**  And Stan was out a year ahead of me, and he wanted me to be home with him.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:26):**  He wanted me to farm with him.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:28):**  He didn't want me to go to college.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:30):**  And so he bought me my first pair of jeans, Penny's Plain Pockets, and there we go.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:37):**  That was in 1976.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:39):**  At first, Carmen didn't get all that involved with the farm.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:43):**  Yeah, so my dad farmed with his uncles, and so I only had to feed the dog.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:50):**  There's always plenty of help around.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:51):**  My mom worked in town, so I didn't have much experience.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:56):**  And I was married into a dairy, I was marrying a dairy farmer.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:59):**  And so we milked cows.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:02):**  And like when we were going together, I never even went in the barn because I didn't want  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:05):**  my hair to smell bad.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:06):**  So I would stand in the pickup bed outside the barn and wait for him to get done with  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:12):**  chores.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:13):**  So it was a big learning curve.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:14):**  I never learned to milk.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:16):**  My mother-in-law told me never learn to milk or you'll be stuck with it.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:20):**  So I fed the calves and did chores, finished running the rake or the baler or the field  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:27):**  cultivator so he can come home or help him out in the shop, fix stuff.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:32):**  I can remember one time he was putting on an old two row mounted picker.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:37):**  He was putting it on the tractor, the M tractor, and he throws the tractor underneath there.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:41):**  And he just needed me to put my hand underneath there and screw in a bolt.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:47):**  I was not going to put my hand under there.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:50):**  You know, I mean, yeah, it was, that was back in the day.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:56):**  Carmen's initial motivations to help out were more about off farm priorities.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:02):**  My role in farming just started to go fast because I wanted him to get done with his  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:07):**  work so that we could go somewhere.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:10):**  So we need my help if we were going to be on time at any point.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:14):**  But Carmen didn't stay on the sidelines for long.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:18):**  It was just Stan and I. It was just Stan and I. And so I basically grew up in a man's world.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:24):**  You know, I went to the dairy barn meetings with Stan.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:27):**  I went to the sale barn with him.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:29):**  I went and got parts for him.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:31):**  So I knew all the guys at the equipment places, the repair shops, the veterinarian.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:39):**  And I went to some marketing classes.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:41):**  Stan was very receptive to giving up responsibility because he always had more to do than he could  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:46):**  get done.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:47):**  And so, you know, right away, he sent me to the marketing classes and I started marketing  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:52):**  the green, which was very unusual for men to do.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:56):**  What did that feel like to show up to one of these classes?  
**[0:03:58-0:04:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:58):**  I'm sure you were one, if not the only woman in the room.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:00):**  I was the only woman in the room and I went with the neighbor man.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:04):**  Stan didn't go to the classes with me.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:05):**  Went with the neighbor man.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:07):**  You know, I have those, those are friends I still have.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:11):**  I guess I, I always grew up in my, in my home with my mom and dad thinking that my parents  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:17):**  thought whatever I had to say was, you know, they wanted to listen to it.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:22):**  So I, I didn't have any worries about not being heard because I'd always been heard.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:29):**  Over time, Carmen continued to be much more than just heard.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:33):**  As the farm grew, so too did her role.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:37):**  So Stan and I started farming with 160 acres, that M farm hall, a two row mounted picker,  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:44):**  and we milked 40 cows.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:46):**  So over the years, we were always in a growth mode, but we were up to going to freshen a  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:52):**  hundred heifers in 1986.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:55):**  We were going to go big or go home.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:57):**  And the dairy whole herd buyout came along, which was a government program that paid us  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:01):**  to quit milking.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:03):**  And then that kind of catapulted us ahead in the eighties because for one day and one  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:09):**  day only we were without debt.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:12):**  We were debt free.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:13):**  We got all that money paid off everything.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:15):**  And so when these farm sales, these depressed farm sales were going on, we didn't have debt.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:20):**  We could buy stuff cheaper.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:23):**  People weren't interested in renting land.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:25):**  So we rented land.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:26):**  Carmen and Stan continued to expand.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:29):**  And then in the early two thousands, their son, Kyle and his wife came home to the farm.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:34):**  2006 was our first year together and we continued to grow because then we had to raise more  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:41):**  income for the family.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:45):**  And I think we farm.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:47):**  Am I supposed to tell you how much we farm?  
**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:50):**  If you want to, you don't have to.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:53):**  Well, this is what I'm going to say is that our operation supports 20 families.

**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:00):**  Over those years, Carmen's role continued to expand rapidly, including looking into  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:05):**  how technology could help the business.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:08):**  I always did the book.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:09):**  Stanley was always the big thinker and I was the implementer.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:13):**  And that was just, that was our roles.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:15):**  And so I got very interested in computerized record keeping from the get go and we bought  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:22):**  a used computer.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:24):**  I don't even remember what it was, but you had to have the floppies.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:27):**  I know that.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:28):**  And I learned how to, how to do computerized record keeping.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:31):**  And then in 2000, I was asked to be a part of a program that was the farm financial standards.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:39):**  And basically what we were doing is we were testing the farm financial standards that  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:43):**  that group was suggesting.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:47):**  And that was really exciting and it made a big difference in how our bookkeeping looked  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:53):**  and we could actually start using it to make decisions.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:56):**  It was in a workable form.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:58):**  And so that was a big deal for me.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:01):**  It was through this work that Carmen met Alan Lash, the founder of Family Farms Group, an  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:06):**  organization that would prove to be transformational for Carmen and Stan.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:10):**  So much so that in looking back, it's one of three pivotal moments in their farming  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:15):**  history.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:16):**  So there's basically three things.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:18):**  You know, dairy ho-herd buyout was before that and after that.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:21):**  And then it was farm financial standards before that and after that.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:24):**  And now it's family farms before that and after that.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:27):**  And so Family Farms, the concept is farms are going to get bigger.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:32):**  You're going to have to know how to manage things that you haven't had to manage before.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:37):**  HR, PR, crisis management, all those kinds of things.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:41):**  And family farms together, if you can find farmers that are like-minded, you will be  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:47):**  able to survive the consolidation that we believed is coming.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:52):**  Their focus was to be exterior and our focus was to be interior so we could run our businesses,  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:58):**  but they would put a lot of new stuff in front of us.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:00):**  And that's what they did.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:01):**  And they helped us to grow our business.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:03):**  I would say that our business has grown by five times since 2006.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:12):**  You mentioned internal and external.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:14):**  Tell me more about that.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:15):**  The way it works is that MBS Family Farms is one of the many farming teams in the group  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:20):**  that come together to share resources and best practices.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:24):**  They provide resources, HR, landowner relations, all those kinds of things.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:30):**  And they also put speakers in front of us.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:33):**  I don't want to use the word push, but encouraged us to look at succession planning and landowner  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:40):**  management.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:42):**  We have a crisis management plan.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:43):**  Would we have had that in place?  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:45):**  Because we have coaches.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:47):**  That's why it's different than just going to a conference.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:51):**  We have coaches and those coaches, we meet with them once a month and it's usually over  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:57):**  the phone, but we do have one-on-one meetings.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:00):**  But they look at our initiatives, help us build our initiatives because you can't do  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:03):**  everything in one year.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:05):**  And then, okay, how are you coming on this?  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:08):**  Who do you need?  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:09):**  What kind of help do you need?  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:10):**  So that's what I mean about external.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:13):**  And there is some buying together and there is some ideas that we do together.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:19):**  An example of this was a certification program.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:22):**  They pushed us into, or they encouraged us to be part of a certification program.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:29):**  So our farm has been certified in environmental practices and farm security since 2009.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:36):**  And it's like, when do you need to be certified?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:40):**  Not yesterday, you needed to be 10 years ago.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:43):**  And when they encourage or not push some of these ideas, do you often find that you're  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:48):**  like, what are these guys talking about?  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:50):**  But you've built up enough trust and now you give it a serious look?  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:54):**  Yes.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:55):**  And I would tell you the thing that we probably didn't take on right away was when they said  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:59):**  how we were going to be bigger.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:01):**  Because we couldn't get past that we were doing as much as we physically could.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:05):**  So we had reached our glass ceiling.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:06):**  There was a whole session on the glass ceiling and then how to break through that.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:12):**  And that what would that require?  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:14):**  And then there was a structure that they helped us build a structure that took our operations  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:20):**  away from our capital.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:21):**  And so we could see where we were making our money.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:25):**  And if we were put having a return to our assets, much, much better than just one checkbook  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:31):**  full of whose money is it?  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:35):**  Whose dollar is this?  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:36):**  I've had a few conversations with farmers about getting coaching or getting help like  
**[0:10:41-0:10:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:41):**  this.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:42):**  And I think it can be for any business owner, a tough thing because it feels like asking  
**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:47):**  for help and you want to say you don't need that help.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:50):**  What was it like to maybe not ask for help, but but in all ways receive help that's been  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:54):**  valuable.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:56):**  It was the timing.  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:57):**  It was the timing.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:58):**  Okay, Stan and I, his father was killed when he was a young man and his mom remarried.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:06):**  And we didn't have to answer to anybody.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:08):**  It was just Stan and I.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:10):**  And then we had a lot of people coming home, Kyle and Carrie are coming home, they're getting  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:12):**  married.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:13):**  We have no idea how to do this.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:15):**  And so that was the exact time that we were joining Family Farms.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:18):**  And so I can remember when the first exercises was, is we had to fill in an org chart.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:23):**  Well there was only four of us and there's like 25 boxes.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:26):**  And so we're you know, like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:34):**  going to buy.

**[0:11:40-0:11:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:40):**  And that also gave Kyle and Stan and Carrie and I a way to say, don't need to worry.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:47):**  That's my box.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:48):**  You know, it gave us some language.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:50):**  Being part of this support network helped Carmen and Stan with the transition as their

**[0:11:58-0:12:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:58):**  We're at a Family Farms conference.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:00):**  And there was a speaker in front of us, whose father had turned over his operation to his  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:05):**  son at what we would consider a fairly early age.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:08):**  I mean, I think the dad was in his 50s.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:12):**  But the point was a farmer probably has 40 crops in his career.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:16):**  And I mean, Kyle needed to have those 40 crops on his own.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:20):**  And so that was very impactful for us.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:23):**  So one January, the four of us met for an owner's meeting.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:27):**  And Stan said to Kyle and Carrie that, you know, I'm still going to be here, but you  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:33):**  need to step forward and I need to step back.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:36):**  And Kyle wisely said, there's three ways you get that job.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:40):**  It's if the father dies, and it's dumped on you, or there's been trouble in paradise,  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:46):**  and you're leaving each other, or you're still here and I can still ask you.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:51):**  And so he and I mean, that was, that was pretty impactful, too.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:54):**  And no, it isn't always smooth.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:57):**  I mean, Carrie Ann and Kelsey have their own lives and their own careers.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:03):**  And and they do things, you know, very well, and they do their way.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:06):**  And they don't have to put up with us.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:09):**  You know, Kyle's here, Kyle's here every day.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:12):**  And what I'm telling you, I'm telling you the good stuff.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:15):**  You know, I'm telling you, you know, what worked.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:17):**  But I mean, they they have to put up, put up with our quirks and our, you know, whatever.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:24):**  Yeah, you know, we try not to have that much, whatever.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:27):**  But there's some whatever.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:28):**  And there's always some whatever.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:30):**  I would say that I love my dad, we're very close, but I don't know if I could work with  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:33):**  him at least not day in, day out.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:36):**  And so I'm so impressed by the people that do because I think it's hard to work with  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:39):**  people you're closest to.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:41):**  I think that's very true.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:43):**  And I also think the girls, our girls know that.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:47):**  In a perfect world, my family has so many talents that, you know, in a whole, I mean,  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:54):**  could just propel the whole, but you've got to be a family first.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:59):**  Over the years, Carmen has had some ups and of course, some downs.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:03):**  I asked her about her worst and her best years.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:07):**  One of the worst years was when we were farming by ourselves.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:12):**  And we had a hail storm that came through and there were 900 acres, probably at the  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:17):**  time out of our 2500 acres that we never combined.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:21):**  And it was before crop insurance was very, a very good product.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:25):**  And we didn't have crop insurance.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:27):**  And our bank made the statement that they didn't think that they could go with us for  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:33):**  the next year without ever asking for one number.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:39):**  They didn't ask me for any financials.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:42):**  They made that decision just because they knew we had hail.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:46):**  We had had a relationship because my father had always suggested you have more than one  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:52):**  banker.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:53):**  And we had a relationship with another banker.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:56):**  But it was on a Saturday.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:58):**  That happened on a Friday and it was on a Saturday.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:00):**  And I called him up and I said, I need to talk to you, Fred.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:03):**  I need to talk to you.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:05):**  And I told him what was going on.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:06):**  And I said to Stan that night, I've got to get my papers work.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:09):**  I got to get my finances and I got to, you know, we're going to have to work all night.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:12):**  And he said, no, let's just see what he says.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:15):**  And I wish I knew what he asked me for, but he asked me for two numbers.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:19):**  I don't know what they are.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:21):**  And he said, you know, you're going to be okay.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:25):**  But that was a that was a I mean, that's a lot of income.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:29):**  That's a third of your income.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:32):**  And then have a banker that we had been with for 22 years, you know, kind of turn their  
**[0:15:37-0:15:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:37):**  back.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:38):**  So that was a bad that was a bad year.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:41):**  It's such an interesting one in agriculture.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:42):**  Like we talk about how it's so relationship based, but those relationships can come under  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:47):**  pressure and you know, there needs to be the I don't know about the data, but but yeah,  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:52):**  the kind of backing to that and the risk management plan that sounds like you had in place as  
**[0:15:58-0:15:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:58):**  well.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:59):**  Right, right.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:00):**  And so the probably the best year what I'm going to save my our best year is we had a  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:04):**  goal one year, I think it was 2000.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:09):**  I don't know what year it was.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:10):**  I should know.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:12):**  Nobody was pregnant.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:14):**  I don't know.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:15):**  Anyway, we had a goal for the farm.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:18):**  If we got 200 bushel yield, as an average, we would go to Hawaii.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:25):**  Everybody, our whole team would go to Hawaii.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:28):**  So anyway, we to make the story shorter, we made it.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:33):**  And we didn't go to Hawaii.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:34):**  We went to Jamaica.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:35):**  So I think there was 35 of us.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:37):**  We took our team, we took my parents, we took this kyling or carry it and and, and Matt  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:45):**  and Kelsey and Greg.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:47):**  And now our goal is 210.

**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:17:11):**  is just one of the ways that MBS Family Farms continues to invest in their people and to  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:17:16):**  grow.

**[0:17:21-0:17:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:17:21):**  Well, you know, when you're a sole proprietor, you're doing everything you're buying your  
**[0:17:28-0:17:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:17:28):**  you're planting your recording, you know where every single piece of the whole process is  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:17:35):**  and who and you know who did it because it was you.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:17:38):**  But when you grow your business, and now you have other people, now you have to rely on  
**[0:17:42-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:17:42):**  somebody else.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:17:43):**  And what was happening is we put together a plan, but the actuals compared to the plan,  
**[0:17:50-0:17:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:17:50):**  we're all kind of dumped into the winter months, and we had to, you know, try to remember and  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:17:57):**  sort it out and get it recorded.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:17:59):**  We would always record them in Bible books long hand I have all kinds of binders of Bible  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:03):**  books.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:04):**  And, you know, the yield and what we actually what actually happened.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:09):**  And we used to do the yield by counting the truckloads, you know, or the wagon loads,  
**[0:18:13-0:18:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:13):**  you know, but but whatever.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:15):**  Well that's tedious, and it's not very accurate.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:17):**  And it was just a horrible job.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:19):**  And so Conservice was a company that Family Farms brought in front of us.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:26):**  And we were not an early adapter, we weren't one of the ones who tried it out.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:31):**  It was expensive, you know, and how could we afford it, those kinds of things.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:37):**  But we kind of let a couple years go by and they and there were other people that got  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:43):**  some of the bugs out.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:44):**  So about the third year in, we decided to do it.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:48):**  And right from the get go, you know, we were finding things.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:53):**  Like one time we were charged for the same load of fertilizer twice.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:58):**  And Conservice was able to tell us that.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:00):**  And you know, one time we weren't paid for a load of beans.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:03):**  Well, we had the documentation.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:06):**  And I'm gonna I'm gonna back up the very first year, nobody owned the data.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:11):**  So I was putting a little in, Carrie was putting a little in, Kai was putting it in and Kai  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:14):**  would say, you know, well, run me a report.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:18):**  Well, it made no sense to anybody because nobody had followed through or whatever.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:22):**  And so one of the Family Farms resources said, you need to have a dedicated resource, you  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:27):**  need to hire a dedicated resource.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:29):**  And as soon as we hired a dedicated resource, it became her job.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:32):**  And she is not an egg, was not an egg girl, but she pretended like she was an investigator,  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:38):**  private investigator, and she would get to the bottom of it.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:42):**  And you know, Conservice, they have really super support.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:48):**  And so if they saw some of our data coming in live, and it was ugly, they would bring  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:53):**  it to they would call up Laura, and they would say, this doesn't match up and the timings  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:59):**  up on this, what what can you tell me?  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:01):**  And so, you know, in the beginning, it was not as good as it is now.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:05):**  But as we say here, did you Conservice that you better have Conservice that you made it  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:10):**  a verb.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:11):**  It's a verb.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:12):**  For sure.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:13):**  I love it.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:14):**  I love it.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:15):**  A lot of really good kind of things we talked about there often come in.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:18):**  So one is like the trusted intermediary introduced you to the technology, it wasn't something  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:23):**  that you know, the the tech itself came knocking on your door trying to sell it, you kind of  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:27):**  had that trusted party, the ownership to kind of have buy in and implement it, but also  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:32):**  the whole team getting on board.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:34):**  And you know, taking it slowly and kind of building up those benefits over time.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:38):**  Those are all things that I would say are best practices in terms of technology adoption.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:42):**  And yeah, sounds like you guys did did a really good job with all of it.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:46):**  And it's worked out, which is great.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:47):**  Well, and I mean, I know, I can't even say that we knew what we were doing.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:50):**  That's just that's just kind of what happened.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:52):**  And then we, because there was such good support, and we would say, well, if it could do this,  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:59):**  it would make sorting so much easier.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:01):**  And so then they started relying on us to change the software or make it more user friendly.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:08):**  So then we piloted another portion of another module.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:12):**  And I mean, our our footprint is all over that.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:14):**  So you know, like, we love it, because it's just what we want.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:17):**  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:18):**  I think that's such an underrated benefit of working with some of these technology companies,  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:23):**  you know, you can have that input and you can influence the features.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:26):**  Whereas with a giant big company, they're just not going to listen to you in the same  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:30):**  way.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:31):**  That that is so true.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:32):**  And that is so true.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:33):**  And I'm, I mean, I'm a big believer and proponent, and I don't even use it.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:37):**  I don't use it at all.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:39):**  I just remember what it was like without it.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:42):**  I asked Carmen about a few other hot areas in ag and ag tech right now, like automation  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:47):**  and carbon farming, both of which she's looked into.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:51):**  For example, they've recently looked at Smart Ag, a retrofit solution to automate grain  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:56):**  carts that was acquired late last year by Raven Industries.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:22:00):**  The founder of Smart Ag, Colin, approached MBS Family Farms to trial the product.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:22:06):**  So Colin came here from the get go and we were one of the farms that tested the auto  
**[0:22:12-0:22:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:22:12):**  cart.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:22:14):**  And that, we're going to, I mean, we're going to do that.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:22:18):**  I mean, when agriculture turns around here, I mean, that's something that Kyle's very,  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:22:22):**  very interested in.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:22:24):**  And the carbon credits, what is exciting for us is that he has been working with our certification  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:22:33):**  records, with our conservice records.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:22:35):**  We're third party certified and they can use all of our data from our back data from certification,  
**[0:22:42-0:22:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:22:42):**  our back data from conservice.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:22:44):**  And some of these companies are very, very interested for the carbon footprint that we

**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:23:21):**  as the farms are bigger is capital.

**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:23:42):**  Right now, right here today, there isn't a whole lot of appetite for agriculture in the

**[0:24:11-0:24:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:11):**  The one I'm reading right now is Monday Morning Leadership.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:13):**  It's basic.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:15):**  It's just very basic.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:19):**  I think that what I'm getting out of this book right now is you have to fix things right  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:27):**  away.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:28):**  You have to communicate the good and the bad right away.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:33):**  I don't know.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:34):**  That's not profiting.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:35):**  That's just what I'm reading right now.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:39):**  We're about to do our reviews.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:41):**  That's on this week and next week.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:42):**  So that's what I'm thinking about.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:44):**  Thinking about, you know, recognition and rewards and taking care of the issues right  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:50):**  away.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:51):**  What I really liked was like, you have to have pain to make a change.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:55):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:56):**  Which I think is definitely true.  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:59):**  And daily work done daily.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:02):**  I mean, that's how you keep up daily work done daily.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:05):**  You do it every day.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:06):**  Exactly.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:07):**  That's a good one.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:08):**  I guess I see my job right now as going out there and I listen to a lot of TED Talks,  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:15):**  something for our Monday morning meetings and, you know, just inspire and give people  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:19):**  different things to think about.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:22):**  And I mean, my son and my husband, they don't read.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:25):**  They don't take the time to read.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:27):**  And so I'm always putting these book reports in front of them.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:31):**  Do you get good feedback?  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:33):**  Yeah, I think they read a lot.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:36):**  It's kind of funny.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:37):**  I hear them say, when they're talking to other people, I hear them say certain things that  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:42):**  have been in the book.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:44):**  You kind of know the influences there, even if they don't say it.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:47):**  I guess I get the feeling that they did read it.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:50):**  So you mentioned there's a couple of kind of big milestones there.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:53):**  And the last one is family farms.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:54):**  What's the next milestone that's coming up?  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:58-0:25:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:58):**  And that would be my retirement.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:59):**  So I'm 62 and I work four days a week and I would like to work three days a week, but  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:07):**  I would tell you that my family kind of wants me here and they're always figuring out something  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:13):**  else for me to do.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:15):**  And I'm not sure.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:17):**  I'm not sure that I will have enough to keep me going if I stop totally.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:24):**  And I don't want to give up taking care of my own businesses.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:27):**  I take care of four of our businesses that are mine.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:30):**  And I could still come in and do that.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:33):**  But how to do that?  
**[0:26:35-0:26:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:35):**  And then Stanley, he stepped back a little more and I could tell even this year that  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:42):**  it's not as, I don't want to say it's not as important, but the energy level wasn't  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:48):**  as high.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:49):**  Yeah, we're going to get it done.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:52):**  But then I heard him say, but now that it's in the ground, I'm gone.  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:58):**  You guys can take care of it.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:59):**  You know what to do.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:27:00):**  So, you know, he won't step away, but he'll probably be more on call where I think I will  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:27:06):**  step totally away.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:27:07):**  Do you have anything you're looking forward to filling up that time with?  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:27:11):**  Yeah, I would like to be, because I've been in a man's world all the time, I would like  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:27:16):**  to lunch with my friends.

**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:27:21):**  I want to learn to play the guitar.

### Agtech - So What?  (2020-57-01)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome back to the Ag Tech So What podcast brought to you by Agtentik.  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  Today's guest joins us from Iowa, where Carmen Maiman and her husband have been farming since  1976.  Their farm, MBS Family Farms, has grown over that time from 160 acres and 40 cows to an  
**[0:00:25-0:00:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:00:25):**  operation that now supports 20 families.  And Carmen has played a key role in that growth.  She's an operator, the head of finance, a grain marketer, and so, so much more, as you'll  hear.  We talk about her journey in farming over the last nearly 45 years, including what she's  
**[0:00:44-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:00:44):**  learned about technology, business, and people.  But Carmen didn't originally want to be a farmer.  We jump in with how she found herself on a farm in a world that in some ways is quite  a bit different, and yet in some ways is the same as things are today.  Well, I graduated from the high school just about three or four miles from here and married  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:08):**  my high school sweetheart, graduated in May of 1976, and got married in August.  So I always thought that I would go to college, wanted to go to Iowa State, be a home-act  teacher.  And Stan was out a year ahead of me, and he wanted me to be home with him.  He wanted me to farm with him.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:28):**  He didn't want me to go to college.  And so he bought me my first pair of jeans, Penny's Plain Pockets, and there we go.  That was in 1976.  At first, Carmen didn't get all that involved with the farm.  Yeah, so my dad farmed with his uncles, and so I only had to feed the dog.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:01:50):**  There's always plenty of help around.  My mom worked in town, so I didn't have much experience.  And I was married into a dairy, I was marrying a dairy farmer.  And so we milked cows.  And like when we were going together, I never even went in the barn because I didn't want  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:05):**  my hair to smell bad.  So I would stand in the pickup bed outside the barn and wait for him to get done with  chores.  So it was a big learning curve.  I never learned to milk.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:16):**  My mother-in-law told me never learn to milk or you'll be stuck with it.  So I fed the calves and did chores, finished running the rake or the baler or the field  cultivator so he can come home or help him out in the shop, fix stuff.  I can remember one time he was putting on an old two row mounted picker.  He was putting it on the tractor, the M tractor, and he throws the tractor underneath there.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:02:41):**  And he just needed me to put my hand underneath there and screw in a bolt.  I was not going to put my hand under there.  You know, I mean, yeah, it was, that was back in the day.  Carmen's initial motivations to help out were more about off farm priorities.  My role in farming just started to go fast because I wanted him to get done with his  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:07):**  work so that we could go somewhere.  So we need my help if we were going to be on time at any point.  But Carmen didn't stay on the sidelines for long.  It was just Stan and I. It was just Stan and I. And so I basically grew up in a man's world.  You know, I went to the dairy barn meetings with Stan.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:27):**  I went to the sale barn with him.  I went and got parts for him.  So I knew all the guys at the equipment places, the repair shops, the veterinarian.  And I went to some marketing classes.  Stan was very receptive to giving up responsibility because he always had more to do than he could  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:03:46):**  get done.  And so, you know, right away, he sent me to the marketing classes and I started marketing  the green, which was very unusual for men to do.  What did that feel like to show up to one of these classes?  I'm sure you were one, if not the only woman in the room.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:00):**  I was the only woman in the room and I went with the neighbor man.  Stan didn't go to the classes with me.  Went with the neighbor man.  Yeah.  You know, I have those, those are friends I still have.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:11):**  I guess I, I always grew up in my, in my home with my mom and dad thinking that my parents  thought whatever I had to say was, you know, they wanted to listen to it.  So I, I didn't have any worries about not being heard because I'd always been heard.  Over time, Carmen continued to be much more than just heard.  As the farm grew, so too did her role.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:37):**  So Stan and I started farming with 160 acres, that M farm hall, a two row mounted picker,  and we milked 40 cows.  So over the years, we were always in a growth mode, but we were up to going to freshen a  hundred heifers in 1986.  We were going to go big or go home.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:04:57):**  And the dairy whole herd buyout came along, which was a government program that paid us  to quit milking.  And then that kind of catapulted us ahead in the eighties because for one day and one  day only we were without debt.  We were debt free.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:13):**  We got all that money paid off everything.  And so when these farm sales, these depressed farm sales were going on, we didn't have debt.  We could buy stuff cheaper.  People weren't interested in renting land.  So we rented land.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:26):**  Carmen and Stan continued to expand.  And then in the early two thousands, their son, Kyle and his wife came home to the farm.  2006 was our first year together and we continued to grow because then we had to raise more  income for the family.  And I think we farm.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:05:47):**  Am I supposed to tell you how much we farm?  If you want to, you don't have to.  Yeah.  Well, this is what I'm going to say is that our operation supports 20 families.  Talk about being in growth mode.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:00):**  Over those years, Carmen's role continued to expand rapidly, including looking into  how technology could help the business.  I always did the book.  Stanley was always the big thinker and I was the implementer.  And that was just, that was our roles.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:15):**  And so I got very interested in computerized record keeping from the get go and we bought  a used computer.  I don't even remember what it was, but you had to have the floppies.  I know that.  And I learned how to, how to do computerized record keeping.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:31):**  And then in 2000, I was asked to be a part of a program that was the farm financial standards.  And basically what we were doing is we were testing the farm financial standards that  that group was suggesting.  And that was really exciting and it made a big difference in how our bookkeeping looked  and we could actually start using it to make decisions.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:06:56):**  It was in a workable form.  And so that was a big deal for me.  It was through this work that Carmen met Alan Lash, the founder of Family Farms Group, an  organization that would prove to be transformational for Carmen and Stan.  So much so that in looking back, it's one of three pivotal moments in their farming  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:15):**  history.  So there's basically three things.  You know, dairy ho-herd buyout was before that and after that.  And then it was farm financial standards before that and after that.  And now it's family farms before that and after that.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:27):**  And so Family Farms, the concept is farms are going to get bigger.  You're going to have to know how to manage things that you haven't had to manage before.  HR, PR, crisis management, all those kinds of things.  And family farms together, if you can find farmers that are like-minded, you will be  able to survive the consolidation that we believed is coming.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:07:52):**  Their focus was to be exterior and our focus was to be interior so we could run our businesses,  but they would put a lot of new stuff in front of us.  And that's what they did.  And they helped us to grow our business.  I would say that our business has grown by five times since 2006.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:12):**  You mentioned internal and external.  Tell me more about that.  The way it works is that MBS Family Farms is one of the many farming teams in the group  that come together to share resources and best practices.  They provide resources, HR, landowner relations, all those kinds of things.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:30):**  And they also put speakers in front of us.  I don't want to use the word push, but encouraged us to look at succession planning and landowner  management.  We have a crisis management plan.  Would we have had that in place?  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:08:45):**  Because we have coaches.  That's why it's different than just going to a conference.  We have coaches and those coaches, we meet with them once a month and it's usually over  the phone, but we do have one-on-one meetings.  But they look at our initiatives, help us build our initiatives because you can't do  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:03):**  everything in one year.  And then, okay, how are you coming on this?  Who do you need?  What kind of help do you need?  So that's what I mean about external.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:13):**  And there is some buying together and there is some ideas that we do together.  An example of this was a certification program.  They pushed us into, or they encouraged us to be part of a certification program.  So our farm has been certified in environmental practices and farm security since 2009.  And it's like, when do you need to be certified?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:40):**  Not yesterday, you needed to be 10 years ago.  And when they encourage or not push some of these ideas, do you often find that you're  like, what are these guys talking about?  But you've built up enough trust and now you give it a serious look?  Yes.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:09:55):**  And I would tell you the thing that we probably didn't take on right away was when they said  how we were going to be bigger.  Because we couldn't get past that we were doing as much as we physically could.  So we had reached our glass ceiling.  There was a whole session on the glass ceiling and then how to break through that.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:12):**  And that what would that require?  And then there was a structure that they helped us build a structure that took our operations  away from our capital.  And so we could see where we were making our money.  And if we were put having a return to our assets, much, much better than just one checkbook  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:31):**  full of whose money is it?  Whose dollar is this?  I've had a few conversations with farmers about getting coaching or getting help like  this.  And I think it can be for any business owner, a tough thing because it feels like asking  
**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:47):**  for help and you want to say you don't need that help.  What was it like to maybe not ask for help, but but in all ways receive help that's been  valuable.  It was the timing.  It was the timing.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:10:58):**  Okay, Stan and I, his father was killed when he was a young man and his mom remarried.  And we didn't have to answer to anybody.  It was just Stan and I.  And then we had a lot of people coming home, Kyle and Carrie are coming home, they're getting  married.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:13):**  We have no idea how to do this.  And so that was the exact time that we were joining Family Farms.  And so I can remember when the first exercises was, is we had to fill in an org chart.  Well there was only four of us and there's like 25 boxes.  And so we're you know, like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:29):**  But what what it did is show us that we can't all be worrying about what seed variety we're  going to buy.  You know, we had to split spread out the work, we had to spread out the talents.  And that also gave Kyle and Stan and Carrie and I a way to say, don't need to worry.  That's my box.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:11:48):**  You know, it gave us some language.  Being part of this support network helped Carmen and Stan with the transition as their  son Kyle and his wife Carrie came back to the farm.  We're at a Family Farms conference.  And there was a speaker in front of us, whose father had turned over his operation to his  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:05):**  son at what we would consider a fairly early age.  I mean, I think the dad was in his 50s.  But the point was a farmer probably has 40 crops in his career.  And I mean, Kyle needed to have those 40 crops on his own.  And so that was very impactful for us.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:23):**  So one January, the four of us met for an owner's meeting.  And Stan said to Kyle and Carrie that, you know, I'm still going to be here, but you  need to step forward and I need to step back.  And Kyle wisely said, there's three ways you get that job.  It's if the father dies, and it's dumped on you, or there's been trouble in paradise,  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:12:46):**  and you're leaving each other, or you're still here and I can still ask you.  And so he and I mean, that was, that was pretty impactful, too.  And no, it isn't always smooth.  I mean, Carrie Ann and Kelsey have their own lives and their own careers.  And and they do things, you know, very well, and they do their way.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:06):**  And they don't have to put up with us.  You know, Kyle's here, Kyle's here every day.  And what I'm telling you, I'm telling you the good stuff.  You know, I'm telling you, you know, what worked.  But I mean, they they have to put up, put up with our quirks and our, you know, whatever.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:24):**  Yeah, you know, we try not to have that much, whatever.  But there's some whatever.  And there's always some whatever.  Yeah.  I would say that I love my dad, we're very close, but I don't know if I could work with  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:33):**  him at least not day in, day out.  And so I'm so impressed by the people that do because I think it's hard to work with  people you're closest to.  I think that's very true.  And I also think the girls, our girls know that.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:13:47):**  In a perfect world, my family has so many talents that, you know, in a whole, I mean,  could just propel the whole, but you've got to be a family first.  Over the years, Carmen has had some ups and of course, some downs.  I asked her about her worst and her best years.  One of the worst years was when we were farming by ourselves.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:12):**  And we had a hail storm that came through and there were 900 acres, probably at the  time out of our 2500 acres that we never combined.  And it was before crop insurance was very, a very good product.  And we didn't have crop insurance.  And our bank made the statement that they didn't think that they could go with us for  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:33):**  the next year without ever asking for one number.  They didn't ask me for any financials.  They made that decision just because they knew we had hail.  We had had a relationship because my father had always suggested you have more than one  banker.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:14:53):**  And we had a relationship with another banker.  But it was on a Saturday.  That happened on a Friday and it was on a Saturday.  And I called him up and I said, I need to talk to you, Fred.  I need to talk to you.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:05):**  And I told him what was going on.  And I said to Stan that night, I've got to get my papers work.  I got to get my finances and I got to, you know, we're going to have to work all night.  And he said, no, let's just see what he says.  And I wish I knew what he asked me for, but he asked me for two numbers.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:19):**  I don't know what they are.  And he said, you know, you're going to be okay.  But that was a that was a I mean, that's a lot of income.  That's a third of your income.  And then have a banker that we had been with for 22 years, you know, kind of turn their  
**[0:15:37-0:15:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:37):**  back.  So that was a bad that was a bad year.  It's such an interesting one in agriculture.  Like we talk about how it's so relationship based, but those relationships can come under  pressure and you know, there needs to be the I don't know about the data, but but yeah,  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:15:52):**  the kind of backing to that and the risk management plan that sounds like you had in place as  well.  Right, right.  And so the probably the best year what I'm going to save my our best year is we had a  goal one year, I think it was 2000.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:09):**  I don't know what year it was.  I should know.  Nobody was pregnant.  I don't know.  Anyway, we had a goal for the farm.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:18):**  If we got 200 bushel yield, as an average, we would go to Hawaii.  Everybody, our whole team would go to Hawaii.  So anyway, we to make the story shorter, we made it.  And we didn't go to Hawaii.  We went to Jamaica.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:35):**  So I think there was 35 of us.  We took our team, we took my parents, we took this kyling or carry it and and, and Matt  and Kelsey and Greg.  And now our goal is 210.  And what I was just so so happy because we could share and invest in our employees and  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:16:58):**  show them the you know, the benefits of being part of MBS and all of that.  The team now has the goal set at 210 bushels on average, and this a shared goal and rewards  is just one of the ways that MBS Family Farms continues to invest in their people and to  grow.  Another area they've invested in more recently is an ag tech solution.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:17:21):**  Well, you know, when you're a sole proprietor, you're doing everything you're buying your  you're planting your recording, you know where every single piece of the whole process is  and who and you know who did it because it was you.  But when you grow your business, and now you have other people, now you have to rely on  somebody else.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:17:43):**  And what was happening is we put together a plan, but the actuals compared to the plan,  we're all kind of dumped into the winter months, and we had to, you know, try to remember and  sort it out and get it recorded.  We would always record them in Bible books long hand I have all kinds of binders of Bible  books.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:04):**  And, you know, the yield and what we actually what actually happened.  And we used to do the yield by counting the truckloads, you know, or the wagon loads,  you know, but but whatever.  Well that's tedious, and it's not very accurate.  And it was just a horrible job.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:19):**  And so Conservice was a company that Family Farms brought in front of us.  And we were not an early adapter, we weren't one of the ones who tried it out.  It was expensive, you know, and how could we afford it, those kinds of things.  But we kind of let a couple years go by and they and there were other people that got  some of the bugs out.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:18:44):**  So about the third year in, we decided to do it.  And right from the get go, you know, we were finding things.  Like one time we were charged for the same load of fertilizer twice.  And Conservice was able to tell us that.  And you know, one time we weren't paid for a load of beans.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:03):**  Well, we had the documentation.  And I'm gonna I'm gonna back up the very first year, nobody owned the data.  So I was putting a little in, Carrie was putting a little in, Kai was putting it in and Kai  would say, you know, well, run me a report.  Well, it made no sense to anybody because nobody had followed through or whatever.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:22):**  And so one of the Family Farms resources said, you need to have a dedicated resource, you  need to hire a dedicated resource.  And as soon as we hired a dedicated resource, it became her job.  And she is not an egg, was not an egg girl, but she pretended like she was an investigator,  private investigator, and she would get to the bottom of it.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:19:42):**  And you know, Conservice, they have really super support.  And so if they saw some of our data coming in live, and it was ugly, they would bring  it to they would call up Laura, and they would say, this doesn't match up and the timings  up on this, what what can you tell me?  And so, you know, in the beginning, it was not as good as it is now.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:05):**  But as we say here, did you Conservice that you better have Conservice that you made it  a verb.  It's a verb.  For sure.  I love it.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:14):**  I love it.  A lot of really good kind of things we talked about there often come in.  So one is like the trusted intermediary introduced you to the technology, it wasn't something  that you know, the the tech itself came knocking on your door trying to sell it, you kind of  had that trusted party, the ownership to kind of have buy in and implement it, but also  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:32):**  the whole team getting on board.  And you know, taking it slowly and kind of building up those benefits over time.  Those are all things that I would say are best practices in terms of technology adoption.  And yeah, sounds like you guys did did a really good job with all of it.  And it's worked out, which is great.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:20:47):**  Well, and I mean, I know, I can't even say that we knew what we were doing.  That's just that's just kind of what happened.  And then we, because there was such good support, and we would say, well, if it could do this,  it would make sorting so much easier.  And so then they started relying on us to change the software or make it more user friendly.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:08):**  So then we piloted another portion of another module.  And I mean, our our footprint is all over that.  So you know, like, we love it, because it's just what we want.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  I think that's such an underrated benefit of working with some of these technology companies,  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:23):**  you know, you can have that input and you can influence the features.  Whereas with a giant big company, they're just not going to listen to you in the same  way.  That that is so true.  And that is so true.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:33):**  And I'm, I mean, I'm a big believer and proponent, and I don't even use it.  I don't use it at all.  I just remember what it was like without it.  I asked Carmen about a few other hot areas in ag and ag tech right now, like automation  and carbon farming, both of which she's looked into.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:21:51):**  For example, they've recently looked at Smart Ag, a retrofit solution to automate grain  carts that was acquired late last year by Raven Industries.  The founder of Smart Ag, Colin, approached MBS Family Farms to trial the product.  So Colin came here from the get go and we were one of the farms that tested the auto  cart.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:22:14):**  And that, we're going to, I mean, we're going to do that.  I mean, when agriculture turns around here, I mean, that's something that Kyle's very,  very interested in.  And the carbon credits, what is exciting for us is that he has been working with our certification  records, with our conservice records.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:22:35):**  We're third party certified and they can use all of our data from our back data from certification,  our back data from conservice.  And some of these companies are very, very interested for the carbon footprint that we  have had in the past and our carbon footprint moving forward.  And that's really exciting.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:22:57):**  And I'm really, Kyle thinks that our data has value and we work with another company  that has used our data back 30 years and put it into some modeling with weather and those  kinds of things.  So yeah, those are the exciting buzzwords.  I'm going to bring this up because I think this is one of the problems moving forward  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:23:21):**  as the farms are bigger is capital.  What I find right now is that a bank would rather have 10 $1 million borrowers than one  $10 million borrower.  Moving forward, we're going to have to finance these bigger operations differently.  Right now, right here today, there isn't a whole lot of appetite for agriculture in the  
**[0:23:47-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:23:47):**  banking and the lending.  If you can't already tell, Carmen is not afraid of doing the work it takes to get better.  It's so impressive how she's always growing, learning and helping others to improve as  well.  I tend to read, you know, how to be better books.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:03):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like business books mostly?  Mostly, but mostly business books or fictional history, but mostly business books.  The one I'm reading right now is Monday Morning Leadership.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:13):**  It's basic.  It's just very basic.  I think that what I'm getting out of this book right now is you have to fix things right  away.  You have to communicate the good and the bad right away.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:33):**  I don't know.  That's not profiting.  That's just what I'm reading right now.  Yeah.  We're about to do our reviews.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:41):**  That's on this week and next week.  So that's what I'm thinking about.  Thinking about, you know, recognition and rewards and taking care of the issues right  away.  What I really liked was like, you have to have pain to make a change.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:24:55):**  Oh yeah.  Which I think is definitely true.  Yeah.  And daily work done daily.  I mean, that's how you keep up daily work done daily.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:05):**  You do it every day.  Exactly.  That's a good one.  I guess I see my job right now as going out there and I listen to a lot of TED Talks,  something for our Monday morning meetings and, you know, just inspire and give people  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:19):**  different things to think about.  And I mean, my son and my husband, they don't read.  They don't take the time to read.  And so I'm always putting these book reports in front of them.  Do you get good feedback?  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:33):**  Yeah, I think they read a lot.  It's kind of funny.  I hear them say, when they're talking to other people, I hear them say certain things that  have been in the book.  Yeah.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:44):**  You kind of know the influences there, even if they don't say it.  Yeah.  I guess I get the feeling that they did read it.  So you mentioned there's a couple of kind of big milestones there.  And the last one is family farms.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:25:54):**  What's the next milestone that's coming up?  Yeah.  And that would be my retirement.  So I'm 62 and I work four days a week and I would like to work three days a week, but  I would tell you that my family kind of wants me here and they're always figuring out something  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:13):**  else for me to do.  And I'm not sure.  I'm not sure that I will have enough to keep me going if I stop totally.  And I don't want to give up taking care of my own businesses.  I take care of four of our businesses that are mine.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:30):**  And I could still come in and do that.  But how to do that?  And then Stanley, he stepped back a little more and I could tell even this year that  it's not as, I don't want to say it's not as important, but the energy level wasn't  as high.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:26:49):**  Yeah, we're going to get it done.  But then I heard him say, but now that it's in the ground, I'm gone.  You guys can take care of it.  You know what to do.  So, you know, he won't step away, but he'll probably be more on call where I think I will  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:27:06):**  step totally away.  Do you have anything you're looking forward to filling up that time with?  Yeah, I would like to be, because I've been in a man's world all the time, I would like  to lunch with my friends.  I would like to take a Bible study.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:27:21):**  I want to learn to play the guitar.  I wouldn't mind writing down some of our history.  I want to be able to go longer periods of time to the grandkids.  You have answered everything and more, and you're a fantastic storyteller.  So thank you so much for taking the time to do this.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/karmen-mehmen-on-farm-growth-over-40-years#t=0:27:39):**  Well, it's nice to meet you and I appreciate it.

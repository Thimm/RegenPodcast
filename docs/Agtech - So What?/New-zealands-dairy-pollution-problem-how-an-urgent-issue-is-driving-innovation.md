    title: New Zealand's Dairy Pollution Problem - how an urgent issue is driving innovation
    ---

    ### Agtech - So What?  (2021-05-05)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast, brought to you by the Agthentic Group. I'm  Sarah Nolet. Ask any farmer what they think about having more government regulation, and  the initial reaction is probably not going to be a positive one. In this episode, we're  
**[0:00:16-0:00:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:00:16):**  putting the spotlight on New Zealand. Its government isn't just encouraging farmers  to meet certain environmental standards, it's actually about to start enforcing them. And  a big part of the reason why is because of the country's nitrate leaching problem, which  
**[0:00:28-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:00:28):**  has led to toxic algal blooms in waterways and international headlines. But behind its  clean green image is a shocking reality. Up to 99% of rivers running through urban, farming  and non-native forested areas are polluted. We're told that all, you know, rivers are  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:00:52):**  dangerous, that you could get sick from rivers, they could harm your kids and your pets. The  Ardern government has promised to clean up. I want our waterways to be swimmable again.  So we're putting in place standards that actually stop the degradation. But is facing pushback  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:01:09):**  from one of the country's biggest polluters, dairy. Do we want agriculture? Do we want  production? Or do we want to get rid of agriculture? That recent story by the Australian Broadcasting  Corporation's foreign correspondent and many others have highlighted the problems caused  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:01:28):**  by the rapid expansion of dairy in New Zealand, particularly in the Canterbury region. But  we wanted to look at some of the possible solutions and the role that tech and incentives  can play. As the New Zealand government makes farm environmental plans compulsory, could  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:01:41):**  this regulatory framework actually act as a driver for innovation and adoption? And  what can other countries learn from New Zealand? Are we all headed in the direction of mandatory  reporting? I sat down with dairy farmer and 2018 Nuffield scholar Matt Hawken and Bridget  
**[0:01:56-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:01:56):**  Hawkins, Chief Sustainability Officer for CropEx New Zealand. Let's first meet Matt.  So we're on a thousand cow dairy farm in the middle of two. It's my wife, I've got two  daughters and one son who's just two months old running it. And my dad is also involved  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:02:13):**  in the farm. We're fourth generation here. So yeah, farming 1000 dairy cows, 300 bull  beef, and we do some cropping for the cows. As sort of part of that, I'm involved in a  couple of other organisations, my farm, which does investments in horticulture specifically,  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:02:29):**  kiwi fruit, apples, hops, kind of right the way through. And then the Rural Innovation  Lab, which we founded, a group of farmers and growers from the region founded in 2019.  And really, I guess probably a push from how best could farmers navigate the future, integrate  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:02:47):**  technology and innovation into their businesses, and ultimately with the vision of being recognised  as the smartest and most innovative farmers in the world.  Yeah, awesome. Bridget, you've got a long history in both agriculture and in sustainability.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:03:00):**  Tell us a little bit more about yourself and maybe how this new change and the kind of  pressures and regulations are impacting your world.  Sure. So I grew up on a farm, a sheep and beef farm just out of Turquoise. And my sister  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:03:14):**  and brother and I still have 35 hectares there. So we're big enough to be needing a farm environment  plan and nutrient budget in the future. So, you know, as well as working in the sector,  all of these things are going to be important, even for really small scale farmers like us.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:03:31):**  And yeah, I went to Massey University and did an agricultural science degree. And I've  just always been really interested in this awesome science stuff and how that can translate  into something that farmers can use day to day to make a difference, be it for sustainability  
**[0:03:46-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:03:46):**  or profitability or just giving them a better quality of life. So a bit over 10 years ago,  I founded a business called Regen, which was focused on helping farmers manage effluent  irrigation. So that's one of those things that's, it's not done well, can be a cause  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:04:04):**  of pollution. But if it's done well, you know, it's a great resource farmers can use. So  we've built that business up over 10 or 12 years and then last year sold the business  to a company, CropEx, which is an Israeli based company, that where we had quite an  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:04:20):**  intersection in between the work that we had done, we also did water irrigation management  and what they did. And they've got some great technology, which I'm really excited to be  bringing here to New Zealand. And I suppose circling back to what the challenges for farmers  
**[0:04:35-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:04:35):**  today, you know, the rates of change required of them is accelerating just as fast as the  understanding of the issues, the way the regulatory framework is increasing. And so technology  has to be a part of supporting farmers to adapt quickly enough to be able to make the  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:04:55):**  changes they need to keep farming. But, you know, as people bringing technology to farmers,  we also have to work really hard to make sure that it's in a form and at a price point and  in a way that makes sense for them to adopt it.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:05:08):**  Yeah, 100%. And Matt's actually done a lot of thinking on this with his Nafield scholarship  around a systems approach to innovation in farming. I'm keen to just stay on the social  license and nitrate leaching problem just for a little bit longer. Like, is this a new  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:05:21):**  thing? I feel like New Zealand has worked hard to have a clean green reputation and  tourism and agriculture, but now there's some of these pressures and maybe they're just  getting more of a spotlight now or like, is this new?  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:05:34):**  Well, it's been building for a while and there was a big campaign actually by Greenpeace,  Dirty Dairying, which was, we sort of moved beyond that. But there was a big upswing in  the dairy industry in New Zealand. So a lot of land converted to dairy, much more cows  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:05:53):**  out there, high milk price and was all sort of gung ho. The white wave of milk was going  to drive prosperity for everyone. But there was, there certainly was a downside to that.  In some regions where you've got different soil types or nutrients would run effectively  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:06:10):**  through those soils very quickly and into waterways and cause issues. And so that's,  yeah, that's, I guess, you know, a lot of things created by man is created by people  is around ignorance, you know, whether it was building cities on rivers and putting  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:06:25):**  waste from them over, you know, hundreds of years or farmers intensifying land use and  not being aware of where those nutrients were ending up. So not necessarily anybody's fault.  But now that we're getting better information and science around it, still a lot of work  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:06:41):**  to be done to, I guess, ground truth, provide better data into those kind of models and  specifically around farm environmental plans and make it very much around that farms, which  is a challenge because, as we know, farms are not little factory sized things that they  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:06:59):**  can have a lot of different risk factors and so forth to continue with.  So what exactly is a farm environmental plan? It's a way to map and measure the environmental  credentials of individual farms. And for dairies, that includes reporting on inputs and potential  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:07:13):**  water contaminants. But these plans have also become part of a broader goal agreed upon  by the New Zealand government and the ag sector to develop cost effective ways to measure  and price emissions at the farm level by 2025. And there's a bit riding on this, if it fails,  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:07:28):**  the government says it'll bring the primary sector into an emissions trading scheme. On  a global level, it's a bold commitment. For example, by the end of next year, all New  Zealand farms will need to know their greenhouse gas numbers.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:07:39):**  I think New Zealand definitely is ahead of the curve in relation to requiring farmers  to have farm environment plans. And so it's not just the land, it's people, it's animals,  there's financial parts to it as well. So to try and look holistically at that enterprise  
**[0:07:57-0:08:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:07:57):**  and say, what parts am I doing well and what parts actually will need to change to meet  whatever the requirement is. And that isn't necessarily reducing the profitability or  the output of the farm, it's doing things differently to meet a range of requirements.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:08:15):**  So I guess coming back to the challenge around nitrogen pollution and the impact on waterways  is, you know, nitrogen getting into groundwater is a pollutant. In a lot of industries, you  have to pay if you pollute. But the way, it's not 100% dairy by any means, but the way predominantly  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:08:34):**  dairy had expanded really quickly and were doing this pollution that wasn't factored  into the whole economic model of farming. So, you know, I think the plans are a really  positive way for farmers to think about actually where is the opportunity to improve.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:08:51):**  How does it compare to other developed countries, you know, Australia, the US, for example?  As far as I understand, it's not the same granularity of what people have to report  on in either country. And I think a key difference for me is that, you know, say in Australia,  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:09:08):**  a lot of the expectations about how farm operates are exactly the same. You're not actually  encouraged to pollute, you're not encouraged to be damaging to the environment and it's  not okay. But there's not a regulatory framework and this process of auditing and actually  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:09:26):**  enforcement of it, that's in play. So, farmers, the expectation is the same, but if you don't  do it, nothing much happens. Whereas here in New Zealand, there's these expectations  and if you're not moving forward and actually carrying on improving until you meet those  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:09:42):**  standards, there are consequences.  And from a farmer's perspective, ultimately, we want to get to systems which are reducing  waste as much as possible, you know, creating a circular system. And I think this is a good  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:09:58):**  way for us to do it. It's just kind of the how is the big one, I think, for farmers.  Yeah, I want to come back to that. You mentioned something that kind of perked my ears up around  the bureaucrats and their views. Like, what's the, is there the kind of conversation around  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:10:12):**  farmers are getting blamed for this? And do you think that's fair? Or how does the narrative  playing out and there's a broader whole range of advocacy and documentaries and things shining  the light on issues and some of that's really good and some of it oversimplifies the needed  
**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:10:28):**  answers and maybe puts the blame where it shouldn't go.  Virgit, what's your sense?  I think in New Zealand, the narrative has started to mature a bit, which is great because  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:10:39):**  when people are feeling under attack, they're not, you know, their best self doesn't come  forward to act. And you're absolutely right. The challenges are really complex and they  didn't evolve overnight and they're not going to be solved overnight either no matter what  
**[0:10:56-0:11:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:10:56):**  people might want. So there's been some pretty brutal debates and conversations here in New  Zealand, you know, to this point.  Sure. Matt, have you ever had any, have you heard anything or read anything where you  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:11:10):**  went like, come on, like, you know, just a bit of pushback or a bit of frustration around  maybe the blame getting put on the industry or on, you know, you as a farmer?  Oh yeah. Look, we've felt, you know, we're big kids, but we've felt beaten up, you know,  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:11:26):**  for a few years really. And probably some of the sad things is when farming kids go  to school, you know, in maybe a mixed rural sort of urban school and get picked on for  being farmers and hurting the environment and all that sort of thing. That's probably  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:11:39):**  the saddest thing I've heard, but these things go in waves. We respond, you know, so a lot  of, lots been done in farming in terms of excluding stock from waterways, riparian planting.  So all our farms are, all the stock have been excluded for many years, of course, but you  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:11:54):**  know, we're planting sort of a hundred to 200 trees a year and that's, you know, we're  probably well behind a lot of people, you know, there's been some really fantastic stories  out there around really sort of, farmers like to call it, we're the practical greenies.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:12:08):**  So we get out there and, you know, do that stuff with the waterways and plant them up  and that sort of thing. So that kind of basic stuff, a lot of that has been done. And so  that has shifted some sentiment and then, you know, probably COVID coming along that  
**[0:12:21-0:12:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:12:21):**  also, you know, New Zealand was tourism and agriculture, the big sectors, you know, tech  is growing as well and we have some industry as well, but with tourism having its troubles,  then agriculture really had to step up. So people had a different view of agriculture  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:12:37):**  again and kind of reaffirmed the importance of food and food production. So the tide goes  in, the tide goes out, but the kind of the thing that we do need to focus on is creating  systems.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:12:49):**  So I'm keen to get into a couple of the solutions. Maybe let's start with Rigid on, you know,  is water and water management being talked about in context of this nitrate issue or  what's sort of missing, if not?  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:13:02):**  It definitely is. So water management in terms of water irrigation is that something that  has been recognized as being a key driver of some of the issue in one particular part  of the country in Canterbury. And again, you know, as Matt said, some of these things that  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:13:17):**  people, you don't know what you don't know. And so some of the early practices didn't  understand fully what was happening in that overall farm system land area where you put  cows on light soil and then irrigated it. But now that is understood, then there's quite  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:13:33):**  a lot of change happened and more to come. But technology has gotten an enormous part  to play in enabling farmers to have all the information they need at their fingertips  to keep making good decisions every day. And I think, you know, soil moisture monitoring  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:13:49):**  is actually a really good example of that. And I suppose, too, also the role that regulation  has played in being a real incentive for adoption. So moisture monitoring where you've actually  got a sensor in the ground and you're getting data from it. And so, you know, at any point  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:14:04):**  in time what your soil moisture is and therefore should you irrigate or not. That is not a  new technology that's been around for well over 20 years that had a very, very low adoption  rate. So people would feel that just by looking, they'd have an idea about what they should  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:14:22):**  do. And they put the water on and the grass grew and awesome, you know, it was working.  But when you're actually monitoring what's happening under the soil, you can see, well,  did I put enough water on or did I put too much water on? And then you actually fine  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:14:34):**  tune that system. And so even though there were loads of trials that showed the benefits  because they're very clear, the adoption was very, very slow. But then in Canterbury, as  farm environment plans, which were audited, came into play, all the water irrigation schemes  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:14:51):**  did where actually we need to have some standards here to be a good, you know, what is good  practice around irrigation management. Then farmers have had to have them. And I think  there's quite a number of technologies that are in that category where the value proposition  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:15:07):**  has been there and the benefits have been there but the adoption rate has been very  slow. And, you know, I wish I knew the answer to that question.  We just released a report and had a couple podcasts on irrigation technology. And one  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:15:25):**  of the big challenges that we highlighted was a lot of these solutions, while the technology  works and there are benefits, they sort of don't fit into a full picture of what's going  to drive change. And exactly to your point, we needed this kind of regulatory stick to  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:15:39):**  be part of the driver for change, which you could say is unfortunate or not, but it is  moving the needle, it sounds like. So that's really important. And I guess where we land  on that is there's an opportunity for other types of business models and incentives to  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:15:52):**  drive more uptake of technology, whether that comes from the supply chain and premiums or  whether it comes from the regulatory side as it may be.  And I think that's the part that also has, we're starting to see some of it here in New  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:16:03):**  Zealand. What's the incentives? Like it's all well and good to say, well, if you don't,  if you're not with the program, you're going to get a slap, but what's actually the reward  for farmers who actually do invest before they have to, because actually that's good,  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:16:18):**  good for their business, that's good for the environment. And so there are some incentive  programs now, which again are done on the basis of audited plans and reports and stuff.  And I think that that also needs to be part of how we move forward.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:16:35):**  Matt, how does that kind of intersect with some of the investments you've made on your  farm and some of the technologies you've adopted?  Yeah, look, one of our values on this farm is connecting with our society. So it's one  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:16:48):**  of our four core values. And part of that is showing that we are a good member of society  that we committed to enhancing our farm and our land that we've been on for a long time  and making sure that's there for many more years to come. And there's a broader piece  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:17:04):**  outside nutrients. So greenhouse gas emissions is a huge one. Animal welfare, that's really  important for us. So we had no bobby calves this last season, which is calves which go  off to sale four days old. So the team's, you know, our farm's really, really proud  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:17:19):**  of that. As I said, we're planting trees. We probably, we use quite a lot of regen without  really having the label on us in terms of our cropping and so forth. So it's all direct  drilled and we don't do winter crops. So we're kind of utilising, I guess, some of the thinking  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:17:38):**  around there without having it specifically in a farm environmental plan. But we will  have the opportunity to draw that all together. And one of the things that the Rural Innovation  Lab are doing, and we're working with some partners across the science and business community,  
**[0:17:54-0:18:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:17:54):**  is the longer term vision is a digital twin. So you kind of, some from a previous generation,  my members some farm where the kids played and you could basically try out different  simulations of farms and purchase things. So the digital twin is really a representation  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:18:11):**  of our farms. It sits alongside a physical twin. And so that's our farms and what it  can be used is obviously sensors and tracking and so forth and data inputs into it can be  used to monitor the farm, make changes to the physical farm, as well as do scenario  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:18:28):**  testing and reporting out. So, and we see the Farm Environmental Plan as kind of one  part of that.  In some ways, the soon to be mandatory farm environmental plans are driving innovation  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:18:40):**  and adoption of the sorts of digital tools Matt is working on. But of course, regulation  can only go so far. The solutions have to add value. And so getting farmers involved  early in the design process is key. Matt says that's exactly why the Rural Innovation Lab  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:18:55):**  has been set up.  So we do three things. We do innovation projects. Second thing we do, we do tech trials. So  we'll have a startup or a company come out and trial effluent or whatever sort of technology  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:19:08):**  they've got. We've got a network of smart farms, which we test and trial those technologies  on. And then we do, we run digital bootcamps. So we had 400 people, farmers and growers  and ag industry through bootcamps, looking at different things, waste on farm, carbon,  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:19:24):**  digital connectivity, etc. And then so we use that to kind of articulate what farmers  and growers challenges are, and then how they can engage in the process of developing these  tools that we need. So we've got lots of smart people developing the technology, we want  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:19:39):**  to make sure it's ground truth and developed with the farmer in mind.  Yeah, you're speaking the same language as me. I mean, one of the big things we hear  about and I've talked about a lot of the podcast is that the value propositions of the technology  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:19:50):**  just aren't strong enough. There's all this talk about adoption. But can we really blame  the farmers for not adopting things? Or is it that the tech just isn't good enough? Whether  it doesn't have that incentive, as Bridget was saying before, or whether it's just not  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:20:01):**  a strong enough value proposition. And one of the biggest ways to fix that is to get  farmers involved earlier to actually shape what it needs to be. I'm curious though, Matt,  like, when you talk to farmers about coming to the lab or getting involved in designing  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:20:14):**  solutions, do you get a lot of interest or do you get a lot of like, I'm busy, can they  just make it work and then come back to me when it's ready? Or is there real interest  in getting involved early before it works and being part of shaping that solution?  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:20:28):**  We launched in 2019 and we sort of thought we've got a good idea. We've got some good  backers with Massey University, AgResearch, Microsoft, and the factory and a number of  people in the sort of the ag tech ecosystem around our region. And in my mind, I sort  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:20:45):**  of thought, well, what if people stopped turning up? You know, farmers don't want this. We  did several events, as I said, we had sort of 400 through the doors and people kept turning  up. And it's probably, you know, we aim to be the trusted place to, you know, help design  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:21:01):**  and develop innovative solutions.  Can I, Matt, just ask you a question just following on from that, because it's really  interesting and I was certainly aware of the Rural Innovation Lab and what you've been  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:21:12):**  doing. And I, you know, I think it's a fantastic initiative. But one of the challenges as a  technology developer and, you know, you're wanting to bring a product to the market is  you're only successful in the business if you get the majority of farmers uptaking your  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:21:28):**  technology. So to have something that works for early adopters is great, but you actually  need something that the majority will purchase and use to make the business, particularly  in a market as small as New Zealand. What would your thoughts be on out of the people  
**[0:21:46-0:21:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:21:46):**  who have participated so far? And, you know, the split between the guys that are more like  the early adopters, they can see here, they see that they, you know, they need to be engaged  in the technology as opposed to people are just waiting until they have to?  
**[0:22:03-0:22:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:22:03):**  The kind of model that we're looking at is we've got a series of smart farms. So they're  individual farms across the region, across sectors, you know, horticulture, sheep and  beeh Derry. And as you say, they are the kind of innovative entrepreneurial farmers that  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:22:17):**  are, you know, going to put their hands up and say, look, we want to work with that,  test and trial that. We've also got a network of smart farmers and they are the farmers  that are not going to be doing that, but they're going to come along and, you know, come along  
**[0:22:31-0:22:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:22:31):**  to an open day on my farm or one of the other smart farms. I think the kind of value proposition  is we are independent in the fact that we're farmer and grower owned and led. And we don't  have any barrow other than helping solve farmers and growers challenges. And, you know, we  
**[0:22:50-0:22:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:22:50):**  are not going to create, we may create, you know, 10 unicorns, let's hope so. But we're  going to provide a very limited service, which helps the innovation process by making it  really engaged with the farmer and grower challenging problem by supporting that relationship.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:23:11):**  So quite often people say, look, you know, we, we can call up a farmer and, you know,  ask them for an hour or whatever. But, and I have a lot of people do that to me and that's  fine. I give them my best shot over an hour, but it's not a very high value interaction  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:23:26):**  and I don't have any real commitment to that process. Whereas our smart farm network do  we, you know, digitally map them all, got the facilities we need and that sort of thing.  So we are creating some value for the innovator to come and work with us and have the rural  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:23:42):**  innovations lab support that arrangement so that when the farmer gets busy, he says, I  got off, you know, I'm too tired and grumpy, which, you know, us farmers are. The rural  innovation labs can step in and say, you know, look, we need your help or, you know, things  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:23:55):**  are not quite to plan in terms of the project. How can we, how can we do that? So we're not  going to solve every everyone's issue, but we are going to create that interface, which  is very much bringing the farmer around the table.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:24:10):**  And Matt has another tool for keeping farmers engaged that he uses on his own dairy. You  wouldn't exactly call it innovative in the tech world at least, but yet you rarely see  it with farming businesses and that's clearly defined values.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:24:23):**  So we've got being great farmers. So for that, that means that we do, you know, all our things  on farm really well. We feed our cows well, we grow good crops, as I said, making our  community proud. That's around our care for our animals, our people, environment and connecting  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:24:39):**  with society. So we're pretty much an open farm here. We have teachers come on, we have  people from overseas when they were traveling. We've had, you know, school students and all  sorts in between. And then building our legacy. So that's our farm development. We were on  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:24:54):**  a development plan as a lean farm. So that's my wife wrote a book, the lean dairy farm,  which was really kind of born out of the experiences on our farm and her expertise brought out  of lean from Toyota. And we were running that across our farms and finding that's massive,  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:25:12):**  massive development for us. And then it's technology development on our farm as well.  So we run a bit of Israeli technology on our farm, and we're always looking for ways that  we can improve productivity, manage our environment better.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:25:25):**  I can imagine that, you know, going all the way back to the point about farmers getting  blamed about open policy and having values and having visits and showing the technology  makes it really hard to point fingers at you, but probably the people pointing fingers or  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:25:36):**  other farmers saying, oh, come on, like, why do we need values? Like, is it pretty rare  to have gone through a process to define your values? And do you get, I don't know, made  fun of or laughed at from others?  
**[0:25:46-0:25:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:25:46):**  Nobody has to my face. They might do behind the scenes. Oh, look, it might be the people  that I mix with, but a lot of farmers are really thinking about this. And, you know,  a lot of it comes back to, you know, the woman in our lives drive a lot of really good thinking  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:26:09):**  around this, you know, when I think about other farms as well. But and also kids as  well. Like I know I've got a six year old daughter and I know she's going to start asking  me, you know, what are you doing about this? What are you doing about that? What did you  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:26:21):**  do, dad? What did you do when you, you know, when you knew that carbon was the biggest  issue of the century? So I want to make sure that I can provide a good answer to it.  Yeah, good. Well, I'm definitely not making fun of you. I think it's super key. And even  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:26:34):**  us like as a tech business get sort of made fun of sometimes for having values and touting  them so much and trying to embed them and believe in that stuff can seem squishy to  some. But I would say it's pretty important. So appreciate you sharing. I'm curious to  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:26:46):**  kind of come all the way back to the nitrate runoff and environmental plans and things.  We talked a little bit about the stick of regulation, but one of the things we're seeing  and I think is enabled by technology is more the carrot side of things that supply chains  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:26:59):**  and downstream actors could be rewarding some of these practices, whether they're monetizing  a carbon neutral milk or thinking about ways that they would incentivize suppliers through  long term contracts or premiums. What are you seeing, Bridget, on the kind of carrot  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:27:14):**  side here around some of these challenges?  There certainly are a few companies that are putting in place programs like that that are,  you know, ones around quality, product quality have been quite common for a while. So around,  
**[0:27:27-0:27:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:27:27):**  say meat production. But one of New Zealand's sort of second tier level milk production  companies, Sinlay, they have signed up to ESGs. And so within that, they've committed  to reducing carbon nitrogen water use. And that is not only from their factory operation,  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:27:47):**  but also from all their farm suppliers. So part of the programs that they run is there  are incentives for farmers is how quickly they move towards like doing their part in  terms of delivering on those incentives. And then the other thing that they do, which I  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:28:03):**  think is really valuable, is they also support their suppliers. Well, how might you do it?  You know, what are some of the technologies, the mitigations, the changes in farm practices  that may contribute towards being able to reduce your carbon or reduce your nitrogen  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:28:20):**  leaching. So, and I think the other great thing with that type of approach as well is  because a lot of this is more and more digitized, as Matt said, the ability to use that as an  evidence base to say this is the progress that we've made. This is where our next goal  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:28:36):**  is and report against that. And that makes it much harder for people just to throw stones  saying, oh, farmers are shocking. So we actually know they're not because here's the evidence  of all the great stuff that they're doing.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:28:47):**  Bridget makes a really good point just around the digitization of this process as well,  because we, as one of the big bugbears of farmers is that we get asked to provide information  by three, four or more different providers, the same thing. So, you know, that's a really  
**[0:29:04-0:29:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:29:04):**  common one that comes up for farmers. But if we, or when we digitize this data, it means  that we can use that information for the different purposes, you know, provide access and so  forth. But it also means we can use utilize the data to manage our footprints and manage  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:29:21):**  our productivity much better. And so we were really, you know, I think that's got to be  kind of a real focus because if we're all running around with scraps of paper, we're  gonna miss the opportunity to do that.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:29:34):**  Yeah, 100% agree. There's a bunch to sort of unpack there. One is the pressures from  the supply chain and like what support companies, whether it's Inlet or Fonterra or Nestle or  whoever can provide, like, is it a carrot or is it a stick? Richard, what are you seeing  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:29:48):**  in terms of tactics and approaches that these companies are using?  The ones that are really trying to be innovative themselves and, you know, move further up  the value chain are putting in place contracts and incentives and ways to attract and keep  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:30:05):**  to them really good quality farmer supplies. And I guess they are an example of along the  value chain, the being sustainable across every dimension, the value accrues as you  go up the value chain. And so a retailer will generally be able to charge more for a product  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:30:27):**  that has really strong evidential environmental credentials.  Do you have an example of that? I'll just interrupt you a little bit because I think  that's sort of the one of the holy grails is to be able to charge more to the consumer,  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:30:38):**  like give a specific example of either someone not getting that premium or getting that  premium.  Well, you know, here in New Zealand, free range eggs is a great example because free  
**[0:30:49-0:30:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:30:49):**  range eggs were, I don't know, three, five times more expensive than caged eggs or battery  farmed eggs. And so that's you could say an egg is an egg. I personally think that a free  range egg actually is a better quality egg. It's a better product. So some of what you're  
**[0:31:07-0:31:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:31:07):**  paying for is that it is a better egg because it's bigger and it's just got lots of more  great quantities about it. But some of what you're paying for is that assurance that the  egg was produced by a chicken that had a nice life in a way that allowed them to express  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:31:26):**  their freedoms and they were kept well. And you know, and you can feel good about eating  the egg. And so as the consumer, you're happy to pay more because those things are important  to you. And now in New Zealand, that move moved everyone so far along that you're not  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:31:44):**  going to be able to buy battery eggs anymore. That's banked. So in terms of, you know, the  challenge for us as farmers here, as you say, if we improve our performance on nitrogen  leaching, that is going to have some impact on the profitability of that same enterprise.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:32:03):**  So there has to be value created further up for the fact that it is produced in a much  more sustainable way to balance all of that out. And I think we're a little way off that  at the moment.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:32:16):**  Yeah, I actually think that example is such a potent one because I might argue that in  the case of the eggs, exactly like you said, it was a story to consumers and it was consumers  recognize the value. And so they were willing to pay, but it wasn't an example of where  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:32:32):**  the science kind of stacked up or where there was an evidence base saying that, you know,  we've done the work to show that these practices are actually better. And here's the outcomes  that it's actually fully achieving these impacts. It's probably more on the marketing side and  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:32:46):**  no doubt it had a systemic impact on the system and what consumers want. Whereas some of these  environmental ones, I think the conversations hopefully changing towards more of a, we can  prove that the outcomes we're trying to achieve and consumers want to vote for are the ones  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:33:00):**  that are actually occurring as a result of these incentives and technologies. I don't  know. Would you agree with that?  Yeah, I do. And I think the challenge is, you know, the eggs, everyone sort of knows  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:33:11):**  what a chicken looks like and there was some really powerful images, you know, so whereas  something like nitrogen leaching is invisible, but there's nothing to say. And so how you  create the story that gets people like we're all as consumers, we're just emotional driven  
**[0:33:30-0:33:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:33:30):**  people. That's why we pay what we pay for whatever it is we choose to buy. Connecting  in such the positive way that can reinforce the change. But the evidence, I think, you  know, from the science base, one thing that really is needed and Matt alluded to it right  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:33:49):**  at the start was because it is invisible in a real sense, like it's all happening under  the ground. And that is necessary for both the incentives and the stick, because you  don't want to incentivise the behaviour and then nothing is different or likewise penalise  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:34:05):**  people and nothing changes as well. So it is a pretty complex area. But that doesn't  mean to say we shouldn't start along the journey and, you know, and just test some of these  things out and see where we get to.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:34:18):**  Yeah, I think more and more it's coming around to how you visualise things. So particularly  on farm, we're going to have a whole lot of numbers, greenhouse gas emissions, nitrogen,  you know, surpluses or so forth. How can we visualise our farming systems, both to ourselves  
**[0:34:39-0:34:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:34:39):**  and to our teams to show what we're doing now, where we need to go, what's good, and  you know, what's above target line, what's below, and how can we visualise that to our  customers and create some value from that. So, and that kind of comes back to some of  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:34:59):**  the discussion we've just had around, you know, free range egg and the visual and the  branding around that. That's kind of where the value will be created for the farmer and  the buy-in for the farmer as well. And there's, you know, there's direct incentives, like  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:35:14):**  we get an incentive for producing quality milk, you know, there's incentives around  how you feed your cows and the farmers that I've talked to, they really get into those  programs and get a lot out of them if they're done and structured in the right way. Over  
**[0:35:28-0:35:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:35:28):**  the stick, the stick prevents kind of the worst behaviour, but it doesn't really lead  us to a place where you're actually incentivised to do well. So I think incentives are definitely  the way to go. There'll always be sort of Johnny Cash's downtrodden, which are at the,  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:35:46):**  you know, at the end that we need to help along a bit, but definitely on the incentive  side tends to work with human psychology and visualising things with farmers is, you know,  we probably learned a few things about having farm programs stuck in computers where the  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/5/4/nz-dairy-pollution-problem#t=0:36:02):**  managers, you know, getting the value out of it, but the team at the coalface is not.  So we need to bring that, you know, that information out and make it visual for the farmers and  for the consumers to capture the value.

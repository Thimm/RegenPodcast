### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 03 Nov 2021 19:01:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agventic Group.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:00:06):**  I'm Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:00:07):**  This episode is the start of a series that I'm really excited about, where we hear lessons  
**[0:00:11-0:00:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:00:11):**  from later-stage AgTech startup founders.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:00:14):**  So these are companies with more than 50 employees, or in the case of our next guest, 300 employees.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:00:20):**  And we'll hear about their journey from founder to executive, and what they've learned about  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:00:23):**  business, the industry, and themselves along the way.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:00:27):**  I always felt like I can't ask people to take risks and then slap their wrists when they fail.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:00:31):**  Like that's just, that is such a crazy environment to live in and to work in.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:00:36):**  I think it's stressful and it doesn't work well.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:00:38):**  And so I have from the beginning said like, we're going to make a ton of mistakes, and  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:00:42):**  that we will never fire anybody for a mistake, ever.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:00:46):**  That's Michael Gilbert, the CEO and founder of Semios, a crop management platform initially  
**[0:00:51-0:00:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:00:51):**  focused on tree fruit, nuts, and vines based in Canada.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:00:54):**  Semios uses the tagline, precision agriculture as a service to describe what they do.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:00):**  It's an example of taking a non-Ag business or startup concept like software as a service  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:04):**  or SaaS and applying it to Ag.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:07):**  And in this series, we too will take some general startup concepts and see how well  
**[0:01:10-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:10):**  they apply in AgTech.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:12):**  So let's meet Michael, who has a PhD in chemistry and worked in pharmaceuticals before landing  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:16):**  in the world of AgTech.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:18):**  Well, Michael, I'm so excited to chat.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:21):**  I have been following not only you on LinkedIn and the company's progress in the news, but  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:26):**  just saw a few billboards of Semios in the Central Valley here in California.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:30):**  So you guys are literally everywhere, which is pretty exciting.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:33):**  It is.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:35):**  We've been, you know, it's one of those, they call them overnight successes.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:38):**  You know, it's been 10 years in the making and it definitely has this arc of like slow,  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:42):**  slow, slow, and then all of a sudden it picks up and then you're just kind of like holding  
**[0:01:46-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:46):**  on tight.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:47):**  And we're in that part of our growth right now.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:49):**  So obviously exciting.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:51):**  Awesome.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:52):**  Well, I want to get into all of that, but let's start with your origin story sort of  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:56):**  personally.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:01:57):**  I think your parents were hobby farmers and you started your career in the pharma space,  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:02:01):**  but tell me a little bit about your background and how you ended up in Ag.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:02:05):**  Well, I'm an army brat.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:02:06):**  So I moved every three years and the last posting my parents had, they bought a hobby  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:02:11):**  farm just out of nowhere.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:02:13):**  We went from living in an apartment to apartment to hobby farm.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:02:16):**  And so we learned everything on our own.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:02:18):**  My parents had this ambition to have like, since you know, nothing bought, we bought  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:02:22):**  sugar and salt and everything else we had to make from butter to cream to like everything.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:02:28):**  And we had like 60 different species of animals and it was just literally like a zoo and what  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:02:33):**  a blast for, uh, for kids to be growing up in that environment.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:02:37):**  I mean so much fun.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:02:39):**  And yeah, from then I went to school and became a natural product chemist and did a graduate  
**[0:02:45-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:02:45):**  school PhD postdoctoral fellowship spent pretty much all my twenties learning about chemistry.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:02:52):**  Did a stint in pharmaceutical product development, essentially taking naturally occurring chemicals  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:02:58):**  and finding out how we can make them at scale for, for human use.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:01):**  And it's a very similar process in agricultural inputs.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:05):**  So for me, the switch from pharma to Ag was not that much of a stretch for me.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:11):**  Tell me more about this farm slash zoo.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:13):**  What are some of your memories from that?  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:15):**  Like were you involved in some of the chores?  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:17):**  Oh, definitely.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:18):**  We had, we had a very minimal budget.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:20):**  I mean, my dad still worked for the military, so, you know, calling the vet was a no-no.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:25):**  So we just figured everything out on our own.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:27):**  So I do remember a lot of the animal stories, like, you know, helping, helping the pigs  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:33):**  give birth, helping the goats give birth, like all these things that we just kind of,  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:37):**  we had a book that was like our Bible, like look, page 43.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:41):**  Here's how you help a sow give birth to her piglets.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:43):**  It's like, all right.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:45):**  And then here we go.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:46):**  And it was like, it was drawings.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:47):**  It wasn't even pictures.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:49):**  And so you're just kind of like learning as we go.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:51):**  I do remember at one point we had 60 goats and we would milk them by hand and we're living  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:03:58):**  in East of Ottawa in Canada.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:01):**  So it was like minus 35 Celsius and you're in there and the goats, like just the only  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:05):**  heat in the whole barn.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:06):**  So you just holding on tight, milking the goat next one, and then go to school.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:12):**  It's a little, a lot about problem solving because you can't just call people to specialists  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:17):**  and you just learn about work ethic.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:19):**  I mean, you just can't, there's no days off.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:21):**  You can't just like, Oh, I'm too tired.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:23):**  No, that's not going to cut it.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:24):**  Oh my gosh.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:25):**  I ran a goat farm in Chile when I lived there.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:28):**  We had about 60 goats and same experience.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:30):**  It was freezing in the morning and sort of nice to be in the, in the milking shed smelly  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:34):**  and you know, all the different things, but like, they're not gonna mess around.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:37):**  You're getting up and milking them.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:38):**  Yes or yes.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:39):**  So sleep it in.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:43):**  Did it make you want to work in agriculture?  
**[0:04:45-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:46):**  I mean, I definitely like even my summer jobs, I work on farms.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:49):**  Like I grew up in that rural area.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:51):**  I'm definitely not a city person.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:53):**  So I definitely love the country.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:54):**  I love being outdoors.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:56):**  And so that was what appealed to me a lot.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:04:59):**  Farming is such an honest work and kind of keeps you honest and it's all real.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:04):**  I haven't found later on in my career doing things, even like chemistry where you can  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:10):**  work for a week and then not get anything really done, but on the farm, it never felt  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:14):**  that way.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:15):**  You always had this feeling like you got stuff done.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:18):**  And at the end of the day, you could see your work.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:19):**  And that is such a rewarding feeling for anybody is knowing that you, that day's work actually  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:24):**  resulted in either a pile of hay or a whole bunch of carrots cleaned out of the garden  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:28):**  or whatever it is.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:30):**  That sense of like accomplishing something is pretty exciting.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:34):**  So how did you make the switch?  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:36):**  Was there a moment when you're sitting there in the chemistry lab and said, no, I've got  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:40):**  to go start an ag tech company?  
**[0:05:42-0:05:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:42):**  Like how did that come about?  
**[0:05:44-0:05:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:44):**  So I was part of a biotech company in Vancouver and we were developing a heart medication  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:52):**  and I'd worked there for three years.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:53):**  We're about a hundred employees and we got one of our main product was sold.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:05:58):**  It was over a billion dollars.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:00):**  It was the largest biotech deal in Canada at the time.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:04):**  And right after that, I was approached by a professor who had developed a pheromone  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:10):**  that was going to be used for pistachios in Iran.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:15):**  So it was a very, very small specific use case.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:18):**  And he asked if I want to help build a company around it.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:22):**  And so I was like, well, Hey, I knew nothing about the use of pheromones in agriculture.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:26):**  So looked into it, definitely my skill set in terms of scaling up manufacturing and all  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:30):**  these things.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:32):**  But I hummed and hawed and whether or not I want to move to Iran or not, I was like,  
**[0:06:35-0:06:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:35):**  that's, I had a young family.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:36):**  That was a big move.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:38):**  And in the time that I was like considering it, he sold that IP to the Iranian government.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:46):**  And so I thought, okay, well so much for that, but it got me kind of like interested in this  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:50):**  like space of like biologicals and pheromones and agriculture.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:54):**  And I started asking more questions about people like, why is this not being used at  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:58):**  scale?  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:06:59):**  And it's that experience that spurred Michael on to venture into the world of entrepreneurship,  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:07:04):**  starting out like so many others with just an idea.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:07:07):**  As most entrepreneurs, I was on my own, you know, in my office trying to think things  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:07:12):**  through and coming from a science and biotech background, I had in my mind that I needed  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:07:18):**  some real IP.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:07:20):**  I needed some chemical based IP.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:07:22):**  And so my idea at the time was these pheromones active ingredients are really expensive to  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:07:29):**  produce.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:07:30):**  So one way we can make this better is find a way to make them like chop it up into a  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:07:34):**  smaller piece and make, find the most effective part and then make it at scale, which is what  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:07:38):**  we do in pharmaceutical products.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:07:40):**  We find that whatever part of the chemical that's necessary, make it cheap and then scale  
**[0:07:44-0:07:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:07:44):**  it.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:07:45):**  So I kind of noodle around all kinds of patents and it turns out that doesn't work.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:07:49):**  And so it was like totally a no go.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:07:52):**  But in the process, I had been speaking to a bunch of federal agencies that fund research  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:07:58):**  in clean tech and tech.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:00):**  And then it just started this little game of like, I get a grant for like 50,000 bucks,  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:04):**  and then I go get some investment to match it.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:07):**  And just doing this little like, side by side, which is what they want to see, like, the  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:11):**  government takes a risk, and then the investors take a risk.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:14):**  And that slowly started building up until we actually had enough funds to start hiring  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:18):**  engineers and kind of slowly went from there.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:21):**  And did you have a kind of early vision for what this would look like?  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:24):**  I mean, you started on the sort of product side and okay, we need a physical product,  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:28):**  probably some of the tech money at the time wanted you to do something more digital.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:31):**  How are you thinking about sort of where this where this needed to go in the early days?  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:36):**  In the early days, it's definitely going to be around focused on pheromones and essentially  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:40):**  bring in pheromone products to market.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:43):**  They were just they're not they're only used in like, less than 1% of the market.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:48):**  And most of the market could use it.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:49):**  So they go Why is that?  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:51):**  And there's a whole bunch of technical challenges there.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:53):**  I thought, well, we can solve those problems.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:08:55):**  But it's mainly going to be my initial vision was just delivering pheromones across the  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:01):**  world.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:02):**  And it wasn't until I think it's probably in our third or fourth year, that we had a  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:08):**  bit of luck go our way.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:09):**  There's a technical challenge around these pheromone active ingredients, and we spray  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:14):**  them out of like an aerosol, like almost like a like a bathroom aerosol sensor.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:19):**  And we spray them on demand.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:21):**  But sometimes if it's too cold, they crystallize at the at the exit place hole, and that blocks  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:27):**  the exit.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:28):**  And so we put in some sensors just to kind of like short circuit that so if it got too  
**[0:09:32-0:09:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:32):**  cold, it wouldn't spray.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:35):**  And so I'm collecting all this like temperature.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:37):**  And as it turns out, the sensor we were buying for temperature was almost the same price  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:41):**  as the one that had humidity and barometric pressures, I said, well, put them all in there,  
**[0:09:45-0:09:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:45):**  we'll see.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:46):**  And then all of a sudden, we had like, on every acre, we had like the temperature, humidity  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:50):**  and barometric pressure every 10 minutes.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:53):**  And then our customers are saying, well, if you have that data, I need that for frost  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:57):**  monitoring.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:09:58):**  And I need that for disease monitoring.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:00):**  And then all these things that are coming from that single data set, which we hadn't  
**[0:10:03-0:10:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:03):**  installed, for that reason.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:05):**  So it was a bit luck on our side that we had put those in.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:08):**  It was like, I think it was like the difference of a seven cent versus an eight cent piece,  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:13):**  like it was like a small difference, but made all the difference now.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:18):**  What Michael just said is really key to building a company, realizing your initial idea might  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:22):**  not be the one with the most potential.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:25):**  To figure that out, Michael needed to get out and understand the pain points or challenges  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:29):**  that his customers were facing.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:31):**  This meant finding those early adopters, which he admits was pretty daunting at the time.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:36):**  I had in my mind that I had to go find the biggest and best customers to start.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:41):**  Like a lot of people were telling me like, you know, go find a small farmer who's with  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:46):**  this less risky.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:47):**  But then I thought, well, they won't know what my problem needs to be, how I need to  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:52):**  solve the problem.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:53):**  So I went to the biggest ones.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:54):**  And I remember at least two trips where I would drive down with my back then my entire  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:10:58):**  team, which was like five people in a car, we drove six hours to go meet a customer.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:11:04):**  And we got in and I was so nervous and didn't know what, how was I going to present this?  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:11:08):**  I had my laptop, I'm going to show this to them.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:11:11):**  And we sat down and it was literally like not even one minute in, we haven't finished  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:11:16):**  introductions yet.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:11:18):**  And he got a phone call and it was raining on his cherries.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:11:22):**  And he had to leave and go help with the helicopter start deploying.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:11:26):**  And so I had spent six hours getting there and we got a minute in and he left.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:11:30):**  He said, sorry, guys, I know you came a long way, but I can't talk right now.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:11:33):**  So I just drove back, tail between my legs, just like, Oh my goodness, what am I doing?  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:11:39):**  And so those were really, really hard.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:11:41):**  I mean, I was just like devastated and cause I was just so pumped about even having a conversation.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:11:46):**  I didn't even get to have it, but we rescheduled, went back the next week and he gave us like  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:11:51):**  two and a half hours of like, here's all the problems I had.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:11:54):**  Here's what I think you can solve for.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:11:57):**  And it just kind of started driving our product development and it was amazing.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:00):**  And those, and I often tell, you know, budding entrepreneurs, you got to find time to meet  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:05):**  the biggest, most important customers in the market.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:08):**  It is absolutely scary, but they know so much.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:12):**  They understand their business so much better than, than a hobby farmer does, right.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:15):**  Who doesn't really understand how much labor costs there are, what's going on.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:19):**  You want to go to the folks who really understand their business and that's where you get the  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:23):**  pain points.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:24):**  Hmm.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:25):**  I love it.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:26):**  I think that's such a good insight.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:27):**  I love that it did work out that you did get to go back because what a bummer, if that  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:30):**  was the end of the story there.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:32):**  And so if you could listen to you about how agriculture works, like I think the, it reflects  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:36):**  the tech industry more broadly, where from their perspective, like this sensor that can  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:41):**  save you this much money is the most important thing, but it's not right.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:44):**  It rains and then getting those cherries covered or sprayed or whatever, like that is the most  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:48):**  important thing.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:49):**  And it is absolutely right now.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:50):**  And whatever this device does is going to come second.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:53):**  And that's just how agriculture works, right?  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:55):**  You're at the mercy of the weather at times.  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:58):**  Totally.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:12:59):**  And it's like, and I found, you know, we have humility became like a really important culture  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:04):**  aspect of our business because when you go to these farms and you come out, come across  
**[0:13:08-0:13:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:08):**  as like the smart tech guy or gal, I mean, you will go nowhere fast, right?  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:16):**  You have to kind of come in like, Hey, I just, I'm here to learn.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:19):**  Right.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:20):**  And you have to have that humidity.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:21):**  Like we don't know what it's like to farm.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:22):**  And these folks have been farming for generations.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:24):**  They know so much about farming and we know so little.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:28):**  And so having that humility and being open to like, I know I have the solution, but your  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:33):**  problem is different.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:34):**  And you can't just keep pushing your solution.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:35):**  It's going to be like, listen, listen, and find out what else you can do for them.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:39):**  And that that's really helped us.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:40):**  And I'd say 95% of our product has come from customers saying, here's what we want.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:47):**  That might sound like an obvious insight, but easier said than done, right?  
**[0:13:51-0:13:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:51):**  Especially if you've got your product roadmap all set out.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:53):**  Then you ask say 10 customers what they want and you hear eight different things.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:13:58):**  So how do you balance the vision with being open and responsive to your customers?  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:14:03):**  We typically focus on the asks that are within our core competencies.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:14:07):**  So as long as it's within our, something we can do well, we'll do it even if it wasn't  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:14:11):**  on our roadmap, but if it's outside of that, they're not going to touch it.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:14:15):**  So sometimes it means like going after the third or fourth top priority because number  
**[0:14:19-0:14:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:14:19):**  one and two, we just can't do right.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:14:22):**  So kind of really understanding what our core competencies and then like driving towards  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:14:26):**  whatever the customer wants.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:14:27):**  And you're right.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:14:28):**  So sometimes different customers have different challenges and we deal with like we're in  
**[0:14:33-0:14:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:14:33):**  12 different crops and they all have different problems.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:14:36):**  Even by geography, it's different.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:14:37):**  There is so many different aspects to this business, but there is definitely an overarching  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:14:42):**  sense of like more data to drive decisions, trying to avoid the ups and downs and try  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:14:47):**  and take away some of the variability in the crops year to per year is standard.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:14:52):**  So that's what we're driving towards.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:14:55):**  So fast-forwarding a bit, you guys now raised hundreds of millions of dollars.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:01):**  You've got how many employees now?  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:04):**  So we've raised about 225 million and we've got 300 employees.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:09):**  And tell me a little bit about that journey in terms of what it was like for you.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:13):**  You mentioned humility as a value, you know, going from five of you, like the whole company  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:17):**  can make the road trip to see the customer.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:19):**  Obviously that's not possible now.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:21):**  What are a couple of lessons that come to mind for you and kind of going on that journey?  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:26):**  It's one of those things that kind of seems to slowly happen almost.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:30):**  So I have found, you know, we were definitely going away from generalists for sure.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:36):**  I used to have a lot of generalists at the beginning who wore five or six different hats.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:41):**  And what often happened is they had some core skillset, but they were kind of extending  
**[0:15:44-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:44):**  it.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:45):**  And so we started hiring to take away those things that they weren't great at.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:48):**  So we still kept the people, but we started hiring more and more skill sets there.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:52):**  But we still have this, we have very much a collaborative work culture.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:55):**  Like we don't, the expert in the room doesn't get to say what's happening.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:15:58):**  There's always like this, like, okay, what does everyone think?  
**[0:16:02-0:16:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:02):**  And so that in some ways precluded me from being able to hire experts who like to be  
**[0:16:08-0:16:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:08):**  the expert in the room.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:09):**  And so we tended to hire people who were like more curious and want to understand, but knew  
**[0:16:15-0:16:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:15):**  something about their space.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:17):**  And I found that worked well in our culture.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:19):**  And so it kept with that humility and it was, we were able to sustain it.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:22):**  And I think people who, who did, who we did hire that didn't quite fit in, they soon left,  
**[0:16:27-0:16:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:27):**  right?  
**[0:16:28-0:16:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:28):**  Because it was like too much collaboration, too much talking, you know, let's just move  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:31):**  forward and we're like, no, we want to understand what the problem is and want to understand  
**[0:16:34-0:16:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:34):**  what the solutions are.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:35):**  And so I've been able to maintain that.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:38):**  It's really important from what I see as being like the key to our success.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:42):**  And so I drive towards that.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:44):**  And it has been definitely learning process because you don't, certainly as a chemist,  
**[0:16:48-0:16:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:48):**  you don't learn anything about people management.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:50):**  I've been to school for a long, long time.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:53):**  I know how to bring atoms together, but people together is not my skill set.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:16:57):**  And so I definitely have read more books about entrepreneurship and management than I ever  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:17:02):**  thought I would, but I also find it fascinating.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:17:04):**  I think it's so cool to see like what motivates people, what gets teams working well.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:17:12):**  Is there a moment that comes to mind that you're particularly proud of, like, you know,  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:17:15):**  bringing a lesson from a book to bear in the company or kind of bringing the team together  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:17:19):**  in a certain way, anything that comes to mind?  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:17:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:17:23):**  At one point, I'm not sure if I'd come as a, like a micromanager, but I was very, very  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:17:29):**  tightly controlling a lot of things at the beginning.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:17:32):**  And I liked having that visibility and the ability to move things at will was obviously  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:17:38):**  very empowering.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:17:39):**  Right.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:17:40):**  But at some point I started getting frustrated by, I was also the biggest blocker because  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:17:46):**  people would wait to ask me and nobody would move without me.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:17:50):**  And so I said, well, that's not going to scale.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:17:52):**  And so I started, I started asking other CEOs what they do, and they recommended this book  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:17:57):**  by my Vern Harnish called Scaling Up.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:00):**  And essentially it's like a, it's the Rockefeller habits management style, but tailored towards  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:06):**  companies that are growing fast.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:08):**  So how do you manage communication?  
**[0:18:10-0:18:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:10):**  How do you set goals?  
**[0:18:11-0:18:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:11):**  How do you do all these things?  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:12):**  And I literally took this book, kind of like how my parents farmed by this book that was  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:16):**  like, this is the Bible.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:18):**  This was how, this is how we're going to run this company, this one book.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:22):**  And it was a huge risk because it changed everything.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:25):**  And I remember the first meeting we had, we brought in a consultant who specialized in  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:29):**  this and we had my entire leadership team.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:31):**  We got together for four days and we hammered out, what's the one page plan.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:37):**  What are the three year one initiatives?  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:38):**  We did all that for the first time.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:41):**  And it was hard, like crazy hard.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:43):**  I think we only got through two thirds of the agenda.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:47):**  It was just way too hard, but we got some of it done.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:50):**  And we started seeing how now, like when people ask me for like, what should we do?  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:54):**  I'd say, what is the, what's the one page plan saying?  
**[0:18:57-0:18:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:57):**  That's the driver.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:18:58):**  I can't say anything.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:00):**  And we've been doing that.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:01):**  And that was probably four years ago now.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:03):**  And we've been doing it ever since.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:05):**  And I still don't make any decisions.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:07):**  And it's fantastic.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:08):**  It's just, it's the strategy that drives the entire company.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:12):**  Michael says he also needed to create a culture that embraced failure.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:16):**  And while this approach is pretty common for startups these days, in the broader ag world,  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:20):**  it's definitely not.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:22):**  So it's been a learning curve for many on his team.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:25):**  It's an innovation thing for me.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:26):**  Like I think creating that, that safety net for people to take risks, I always felt like  
**[0:19:33-0:19:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:33):**  I can't ask them to take risks and then slap their wrists when they fail.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:36):**  Like that's just, that is such a crazy environment to live in and to work in.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:41):**  I think it's stressful and it doesn't work well.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:43):**  And so I have from the beginning said like, we're going to make a ton of mistakes and  
**[0:19:47-0:19:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:47):**  that we will never fire anybody for a mistake ever.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:50):**  We'll only fire people for culture, never for making mistakes.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:54):**  And if anything, we're going to come up to people and say, listen, you haven't missed  
**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:19:58):**  goal in a year.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:00):**  Are you really pushing yourself to try new things?  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:02):**  Like we need to innovating all the way.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:05):**  And you know, it's one of our, it's probably our biggest advantage when you visa V like  
**[0:20:11-0:20:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:11):**  the large multinationals who have deep pockets, all the customers who take zero risks, we  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:18):**  have to be taking risks.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:20):**  It's key to our growth.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:21):**  And we have to make that environment that will, that will reward that.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:24):**  So it is a little bit scary.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:26):**  We've had a few events that were like, Oof, that was tricky.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:30):**  We had an event once where a bunch of our devices were nearly bricked.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:35):**  So we couldn't access them anymore and they were not talking to the network anymore.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:39):**  And so we have to go back and hack our way back into them.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:42):**  And it took like, I think 48 hours to get them all back.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:45):**  Like everyone on deck, just kind of back door through the, through the communication channel.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:51):**  We call it the apocalypse.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:53):**  It was scary, but you know what?  
**[0:20:55-0:20:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:55):**  We learned a lot from that process and no one got reprimanded.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:20:58):**  No one got the bad review.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:00):**  It was like, Hey, learn from it and go.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:03):**  And that still is core to our business today.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:05):**  And I tell people coming in, you know, you may not have had that in the prior environment.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:09):**  That doesn't mean you won't be successful here, but know that it's critical to being  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:13):**  successful here is embracing risk and, and creating a safety net amongst your colleagues  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:18):**  where when they once in a while stub their toe or fail, it's like, Hey, what did we learn  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:23):**  from it and go forward.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:26):**  Another difference in ag tech is the time that it can take to scale.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:29):**  For Michael, that means managing investor expectations and it means making sure you  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:34):**  choose the right investors.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:35):**  Yeah, it's definitely been a bit of a minefield for sure.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:39):**  A lot of Silicon Valley bets have been on types of technologies and companies that scale  
**[0:21:44-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:44):**  at incredible rates.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:45):**  I mean, think of like, I think of how, how, how zoom did during COVID.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:51):**  I mean, insane.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:52):**  The kind of growth you see there is what everybody wants, right?  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:21:57):**  And it's, you know, when you have IOT and you have hardware and you have field services  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:02):**  and people involved and scaling, that is so unlikely to happen.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:07):**  You know, I almost say it's impossible.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:09):**  And so I think a lot of these investors are, they need to, that has to be on the table  
**[0:22:14-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:14):**  for them to go in.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:16):**  And I know we're going to have an amazing growth trajectory and we're, we're doing well,  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:21):**  we're doing as planned and it's going to keep going that way, but I could never do like  
**[0:22:26-0:22:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:26):**  a 10 X revenue year over year.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:28):**  It was not going to happen for us.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:29):**  And so even though we would be a success in their books, they can't afford to bet on us  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:33):**  because they need to bet on people who can go to the 10 X in a year for that, for their  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:38):**  not math to work.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:39):**  And so that was always a challenge.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:42):**  And I didn't want to be in a position where I had to over commit our growth rate.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:46):**  And then all of a sudden, like I'm pushing my team in ways that I knew they could not  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:49):**  be successful at.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:51):**  So it was important.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:52):**  We found the right investors and I spoke to a lot of investors and was able to find folks  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:22:56):**  who did believe that the market we were in was absolutely massive.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:02):**  There were major step changes coming to this market, but that we would kind of go in and  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:06):**  we'd have low churn rate.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:08):**  We'd have a high switching costs and we would grow this market, but it would be at the rate  
**[0:23:14-0:23:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:14):**  that the market can handle.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:17):**  You were talking before about sort of true believers, right?  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:20):**  These people that actually are kind of going to believe in it for the right reason and  
**[0:23:23-0:23:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:23):**  be on board.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:24):**  That's what we talk about, at least with investors is how important it is to qualify and any  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:28):**  kind of tactics or advice for entrepreneurs out there raising right now that are in this  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:32):**  similar struggle of kind of bridging this gap between ag and venture.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:36):**  To be fair, I do tell my investors that the 10X is there, just not in a year, right?  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:42):**  So it's all about timeline.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:44):**  So for me, it's all about what timeline do you have?  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:46):**  If you want a 10X in the next year, that's not going to happen.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:50):**  But if you have the patience for it, we can probably beat that.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:54):**  So it's all about timelines for them.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:55):**  So how patient is the capital?  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:23:57):**  And so we've been able to find folks who actually had that patience, who had that timeline horizon  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:02):**  and that paid off well for us.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:05):**  The ag tech ecosystem has matured enough that we now have a mix of startups from very early  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:09):**  to later stages.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:11):**  But it means we also have the messy middle, the companies that are past early stage, but  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:15):**  are still risky where the tech or demand isn't quite proven out.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:19):**  So is it even harder in ag tech to get past this messy middle?  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:23):**  This might be moving to a completely different geography or a different crop type, for example.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:28):**  And it's not easy.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:29):**  I asked Michael how Semias is going in terms of getting to the other side of this curve  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:33):**  or valley of death, as it's sometimes called.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:36):**  We definitely look a lot at the ecosystem right now.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:39):**  There's probably close to a thousand ag tech companies out there today, if not more.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:44):**  And I'd say the vast majority, I don't know, probably over 85% have less than a million  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:50):**  in revenue.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:51):**  A lot of them are just starting.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:54):**  I'm surprised we haven't seen more activity from the big multinationals.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:24:58):**  They've been sitting on the sidelines for a while now.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:00):**  And we did see quite a bit of consolidation amongst the multinationals.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:05):**  The big six became the big three.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:07):**  And the other challenge that I see is there isn't a great retail channel for ag tech.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:15):**  The ag retail channel is designed for chemicals, seeds, and tractors, and not for software,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:22):**  IoT, and sensors.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:23):**  And so the ones who do are kind of doing it on the side of their desks, and it's not really  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:28):**  what they're focused on.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:29):**  And I'm seeing now a lot of smaller young companies coming and want to get to the market.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:35):**  And we're actually seeing an opportunity for Samy to step up and somebody has become a  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:40):**  retail channel, almost like an app store to help tech get to these customers.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:45):**  Because there's no other way they're going to get there.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:46):**  It's really, really hard.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:48):**  And the channels that exist are not designed.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:50):**  They don't know how to sell software.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:51):**  I remember back in the day, we were working through a channel and a customer would forget  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:57):**  their password.  
**[0:25:58-0:25:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:58):**  And it's like the sky was falling.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:25:59):**  I was like, dude, there's a button right there.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:02):**  You press the button.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:03):**  It's not a big deal.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:04):**  But it was like, they're just not designed for that.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:07):**  And they're not incentivized for it.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:08):**  It's just all broken.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:10):**  And so either we need to have a truly independent retail channel that shows up and sells, or  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:16):**  we're going to start doing it for a lot of folks.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:18):**  Yeah, that's what I was going to ask, kind of what does it mean to stay independent in  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:22):**  this space, given that so much of the channel is incentivized on other products, and even  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:26):**  the acquisitions we've seen really now are sort of loss leaders to sell other products?  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:31):**  How do you guys kind of think about independence?  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:34):**  For whatever reason, the ad market kind of let itself get away with the pharmacist and  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:40):**  the doctor being the same person.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:43):**  And that is just not a great business model.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:46):**  And when the person recommending your products is the one that sells them to you, you're  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:49):**  bound to get some bias.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:51):**  But whatever, it came to be and it has been working somewhat well.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:26:55):**  But I think what we're seeing now is, especially around the larger family operations, which  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:00):**  are getting bigger and bigger now, they're not buying that at all.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:04):**  They're like getting their own advice, independent advisors.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:07):**  And now they're kind of wondering why they're buying through the retail channel, because  
**[0:27:10-0:27:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:10):**  they don't want the advice anyways.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:12):**  Should they go direct?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:13):**  So that's going to get super challenged right now.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:15):**  As far as get bigger, that model of like, hey, just trust me, here's what you need,  
**[0:27:19-0:27:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:19):**  it's not going to work anymore.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:21):**  So when I think about the retail channel being challenged in terms of that, the doctor and  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:27):**  pharmacist combination being challenged, I think that more and more farmers are going  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:32):**  to value an independent steward of the data.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:36):**  So they're going to want to see data, obviously being grown and created more value and more  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:40):**  insights.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:41):**  But trying to keep it just arms length away from the chemicals, seed providers, and then  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:47):**  advice providers.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:48):**  So we want to keep that somewhat independent, but at scale.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:51):**  And right now that's the challenge is those data stewards are not at scale yet.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:27:56):**  And so we're now striving to become that.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:28:00):**  And when you have that data, broader incentives can come into play, such as sustainability  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:28:04):**  linked loans or other financial incentives.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:28:07):**  There's also the potential of new products entering the market, such as biologicals.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:28:11):**  But how can you actually capture the value of these market trends?  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:28:14):**  Michael says he's considering all of these possibilities.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:28:18):**  I think there will be a switch from more traditional, broad insecticide approaches to more specific  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:28:24):**  biologicals.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:28:25):**  But I think more important is going to be around the timing of applications and the  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:28:29):**  number of applications.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:28:31):**  And so like in Europe, the green deal is now they're not going to mandate a 50% reduction  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:28:37):**  in all chemicals, whether they're biologicals or not.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:28:39):**  I think you're going to see more and more push towards like, what's the timing and what  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:28:44):**  locations are you spraying and getting that more accurate.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:28:48):**  And so I do believe that data will be core to that and understanding risks and forecasting  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:28:54):**  them is going to be important.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:28:56):**  One of the challenges in ag tech that I see is that you need the granularity of your data  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:03):**  and the granularity of your ability to deliver on that have to kind of go hand in hand.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:07):**  If you can tell the grower by the tree what's happening, but they can only spray by the  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:11):**  block, you kind of lost it, right?  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:13):**  So they're kind of going step in step right now.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:15):**  I think data got a little bit ahead.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:17):**  So we're focusing on the control systems.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:19):**  How do we get those up as well?  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:20):**  So we can watch them.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:22):**  But that's where this has to go.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:23):**  And I think it's going to get there.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:24):**  And ultimately, that's what sustainability needs.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:28):**  And a lot of even though a lot of the traditional chemicals work really well, you try to manage  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:33):**  how much you put out there.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:34):**  And they are obviously very potent, but you don't need to spray the whole field every  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:39):**  two weeks.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:40):**  And that is simply not required.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:44):**  In the tech world, again, kind of drawing parallels between the two, there's this narrative  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:48):**  of going from the kind of premium product or higher value than kind of going down market  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:53):**  as you come down the cost curve, and you can open up new markets now that you're more affordable.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:29:59):**  Do you think the same narrative kind of applies in agriculture, you know, starting in specialty  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:03):**  and expanding out into broadacre?  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:05):**  Do the differences in supply chain weigh on your mind there?  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:09):**  Or is that just a total oversimplification?  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:12):**  No I think it's true.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:13):**  One of the things that I liked about the permanent crop or the high value crop space is that  
**[0:30:19-0:30:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:19):**  there was relatively little investment here.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:21):**  Like back when in the early 2000s, everybody was doing broadacres, right?  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:27):**  That's when Climate Corp was going gangbusters and everybody was looking at row crops.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:31):**  I think at one point I saw it was like of the 45 billion invested in ag tech, like 43  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:36):**  was on broadacres.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:37):**  Like it was just like, it got more than the lion's cheers.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:42):**  So I was like, well, I kind of want to go where it's less busy and create my own little  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:47):**  niche space.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:48):**  So that's kind of what drove that.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:50):**  But we've been looking hard at all the types of crops and there's lots in between broadacres  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:54):**  and permanent crops, right?  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:30:56):**  What we often find is that the number of sensors required to monitor those crops tends to be  
**[0:31:02-0:31:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:31:02):**  a lot less.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:31:03):**  And so the cost, the cogs come down, which means we can actually make money and charge  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:31:08):**  less but still make money on those acres.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:31:10):**  And so I do believe there's going to be room for all that to happen.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:31:14):**  And a recent acquisition of Agworld obviously brought in a lot of broadacre crops, acres,  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:31:21):**  and we're now going through a process of understanding what those crops mean, how we can best approach  
**[0:31:26-0:31:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:31:26):**  them.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:31:27):**  But I do believe that our solution, both on the IoT side and the data analytics will help  
**[0:31:31-0:31:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:31:31):**  in those environments.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:31:32):**  Going back to your kind of strategy and these parallels between the kind of business, I  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:31:37):**  guess, playbooks and ag tech, are there templates for businesses or business models in other  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:31:42):**  industries that you sort of look to and say, yes, we're trying to be the ex of ag tech  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:31:47):**  or this is a playbook that really resonates with what we're trying to do?  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:31:52):**  Kind of.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:31:53):**  One of the things that we use a lot is, I think it's Jim Collins, had a model around  
**[0:31:59-0:32:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:31:59):**  the flywheel.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:00):**  The most common business one is the Amazon flywheel.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:03):**  How do you start accelerating?  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:06):**  And so we've been kind of like watching for like, is there a flywheel in our business  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:10):**  and what does it look like and how do we focus on it?  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:13):**  And I think we have identified one that we believe works.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:16):**  And so we're focused on that to see how we can grow and accelerate our business.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:21):**  And so that's what we're looking at.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:22):**  I mean, obviously, Amazon's been a massive success story.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:26):**  But just the scale that they have is incredible.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:29):**  And then it's that whole model of growing, keeping kind of cash flow neutral, but just  
**[0:32:34-0:32:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:34):**  growing, growing, growing.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:35):**  And so I think we're going to probably follow that model as close as we can.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:39):**  It's definitely going to be a land grab in this market.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:43):**  It's going to be about digitizing those acres and offering some services and becoming sticky  
**[0:32:49-0:32:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:49):**  and offering more value.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:50):**  And it's going to be a race.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:52):**  And so it's good to be well capitalized and going after acquisitions that can help that.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:32:58):**  You mentioned recently on LinkedIn that you've been talking to your kids about the food system  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:02):**  and kind of transparency and where food comes from.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:05):**  Do they think what you do is cool or not very cool?  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:09):**  Yeah, I think kids never think their parents are cool, especially when they're teenagers.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:13):**  We're not that cool.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:14):**  But they do, they hear a lot at the dinner table in terms of kind of why I'm doing what  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:20):**  I'm doing.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:21):**  And I'd tell them about the types of regions we're going into.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:24):**  Like, I'm going to Argentina this week.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:26):**  I'm going to Europe this week.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:27):**  And here's the types of crops that are there.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:29):**  Often talk about like how far food has to travel to get to our plate and what does it  
**[0:33:34-0:33:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:34):**  mean to be in season versus not in season and how that affects us.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:37):**  So yeah, I do think they see the value in food and they appreciate kind of the selection  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:44):**  we have today and the amazing, I mean, my son actually works in a grocery store in the  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:48):**  products department.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:50):**  So he sees like all the stuff and it's amazing what we have and what we have to do to maintain  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:33:54):**  that for like all seven, soon to be 10 billion people in the planet.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:34:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:34:02):**  I never realized how much those dinner table conversations, I mean, it goes back to your  
**[0:34:05-0:34:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:34:05):**  parents and the hobby farm and kind of how these dots end up connecting.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:34:08):**  My dad worked in the semiconductor industry.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:34:09):**  He's always been an entrepreneur and investor.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:34:11):**  And when people are like, you know, how did you end up starting your own company and being  
**[0:34:14-0:34:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:34:14):**  an investor and all this stuff?  
**[0:34:15-0:34:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:34:15):**  It's like, well, I just, you don't, you don't kind of connect those dots until you realize,  
**[0:34:18-0:34:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:34:18):**  well, you didn't, you didn't know any other playbook because that those were the dinner  
**[0:34:21-0:34:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:34:21):**  table conversations.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/later-stage-agtech-startup-founders#t=0:34:22):**  And so he was talking about people management and who do you hire and how do you grow this

### Agtech - So What?  (2022-09-07)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by Tenacious Ventures.  I'm Sarah Nolet.  One of the things we love most about our podcast is the opportunity it gives us to learn from  
**[0:00:13-0:00:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:13):**  our listeners.  Back in June of this year, we made the decision to learn out loud about the future of risk  and insurance in agriculture.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:21):**  It was a three-part series that honestly came from our own digging around, reaching out  to experts in our network and testing hypotheses with each other out in the open.  And during the series, we were pumped to hear from a listener who seemed to be as interested  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:35):**  as we were in the challenges and opportunities within ag insurance as it exists today.  I've asked this of a state agribusiness manager, we're spending money to ensure that we're  paying back any liabilities to you.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:50):**  Can you give us a cut in our margin?  And his answer was, oh, we've really got no appetite for that.  We already know we can get our money back and you're not a risk to us anyway, so it  
**[0:01:00-0:01:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:00):**  doesn't really matter.  So that is a really poor answer.  Maybe we should go and find someone who does align with our values.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:07):**  That's Tom Ferguson.  He's a farmer in Northern New South Wales.  And after listening to one of our episodes about parametric insurance, Tom reached out  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:14):**  to share his experience as a farmer and policyholder and the work he's done learning about insurance  to reduce risk on his own operation.  Tom recently sat down with my occasional cohost and co-founder at Tenacious Ventures, Matthew  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:28):**  Pryor, to share his experience for the benefit of our learning and our theories on where  the insurance industry might be headed.  We found his insights so relevant, especially in the wake of our previous insurance discussions,  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:40):**  that we asked Tom's permission to share them with all of you.  I'll drop you in here where Tom gets into his early explorations of using insurance  on his farm.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:48):**  I took on the role of managing the cropping and that's where the risk management for us  really started to wind up.  We've been through until two years ago, like 15, 16 were two of the best years we'd ever  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:05):**  seen.  And then 17, 18, 19 were three of the worst years ever recorded here.  So we saw the huge fluctuation in seasonal variability, which we both say monthly that  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:20):**  it was the best thing that could have ever happened to us because it's made us understand  the risks that we play with.  And now we're going into potentially what could be one of the wettest years.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:29):**  So how we go about managing this risk is probably top of mind to me.  I suppose in many years gone by with the risk in farming, people haven't really taken a  proactive step to try and manage that risk.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:43):**  So that's become a big part of what we do every day.  So what are the specific circumstances that represent those kinds of risks in the weather  and climate sense?  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:53):**  The leading one is lack of rainfall.  Our production is driven off stored fallow moisture.  So lack of rainfall through the summer months, then lack of rainfall through our growing  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:05):**  season.  This year it has been too much rain at planting.  We haven't physically been able to get the crop in the ground, but that's probably specific  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:13):**  to 10% of years or 5% of years.  And probably the other one is rain at harvest.  So degrading yields and quality at harvest time is probably the other main drama we have.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:25):**  When did you start understanding why Parametric Insurance was a good match for those kinds  of risks that you were exposed to?  Parametric Insurance has been around commercially for 30 plus years in Australia.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:40):**  It's just never been delivered to Ag.  I don't know what that reason is.  There's a fairly high lack of uptake with all of these products.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:49):**  So the insurances that first started getting roll on the multi-parrel insurances, and that's  where we started with this.  I don't think anyone's offering a multi-parrel in Australia anymore because the model was  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:01):**  flawed.  We got five out of six payouts.  So there's a problem with that model.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:07):**  The whole idea of insurance is you don't want to claim every year and everyone has a different  opinion on this, but the idea is to take out the highs and lows.  We want to buffer ourselves from the extreme.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:17):**  So those multi-parrel products, the fact they are paying out so often meant that you were  playing in the wrong space.  They're trying to cover too many perils for the premium.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:30):**  So going into the Parametric Insurance, you're able to tailor.  So the multi-parrel, I suppose I should clarify this, it covers every peril.  It's on a dollar per hectare agreed value.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:43):**  If you don't meet that value, they will top up.  So when we start looking at Parametric Insurance, we are then having to go, it's not every parameter.  It's either excess rain, lack of rain, hail is coming into Parametric Insurance.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:59):**  If it's specifically and independently measured, they will generally write a policy on it.  So then it's back to the farmer or the consumer of that product to work out what the risk  is in their business.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:13):**  As we dug into that more, it felt like maybe there were two aspects about why things like  multi-parrel or more traditional forms of insurance were CAFO.  The first is, as you say, if the policy is paying out all the time, like it's going to  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:28):**  be expensive for everybody.  But the second also is it seemed maybe before a lot of this stuff was more digital, the  tailoring part perhaps was harder to do for a lot of people.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:40):**  Like you had to have an agronomist or a specialized salesperson who could work with you to help  you tailor it.  Whereas maybe a bit more these days, the more modern products, perhaps, and I'd be interested  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:52):**  in how you take delivery of these products, but the ones we've seen that you can actually  get on a kind of dashboard and dial it up a bit and say, these are the specific events  that I'm interested in and this is how I want to tailor it specifically for me.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:05):**  That's right.  Before there is someone selling you that product, you have to know in your business what risks  you're facing.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:11):**  No one can tell you that.  So the process that we went back and we started looking at income and expenses per millimetre  of rain over 25 years of financial data and looking at those big ticks, what made that  
**[0:06:25-0:06:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:25):**  boom or what made that bust.  And then looking at our fallow rain to our in-crop rain and trying to decide where our  biggest risks were and then coupling that with, right, our biggest risk for the last  
**[0:06:37-0:06:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:37):**  couple of years has been excess rain and harvest.  Let's look at that specific period.  And this is not something anyone's going to be able to tell you.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:43):**  And every farm will generally probably be different given their location in the country.  But we know that if we've got a ripe crop sitting there on the 25th of October, our  proportion of early crop is 30%.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:58):**  So it is going to be the ripest.  If we get a storm in that time, and it dumps 20ml of rain on us, and October is generally  starting, well it is getting hot.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:07:10):**  So 25ml if the sun comes out two hours later or the next day, that will not put us in a  situation where we are losing quality.  What happens though, a couple of storms in a row, then that puts us in a situation where  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:07:30):**  we're sprouting, we're losing test weight, we're losing quality and we're losing money.  So that's the first risk is that we get days of rain together.  And the other risk is we live on a gigantic floodplain.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:07:42):**  So what happens if we get a huge amount of rain in the six weeks that we are trying to  harvest, which makes the ground completely untrafficable?  And that might be 80ml of rain or 100ml of rain in that time period.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:07:56):**  So trying to see what makes our business tick.  On the flip side to the end of 2019, when the drought was really biting hard, we decided  to take out one for rain.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:11):**  So the complete opposite, we're trying to hedge against it raining, now we're hedging  for it to rain.  And we said if we can get 120ml of rain in this period, that'll get us out of trouble,  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:22):**  we'll have enough moisture to plant sheep feed.  And we ended up with 80ml and we grew enough feed to keep us through the next two months  until it actually started raining again.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:33):**  So it's about knowing your production system and what you need, and then hedging against  the biggest risk in that concept and that idea that you're trying to get through.  You also mentioned there coming in doing this economic analysis over a pretty long period  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:48):**  with the data.  That sparked two questions for me, the first, is there anything you think in your background  or your kind of journey into being in this role that made you perhaps more interested  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:01):**  or willing to do that kind of analysis?  And secondarily, how hard was it to bring all that data together?  And when you think about other people doing that, what are the kind of enablers or blockers  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:13):**  to allow people to be able to do that basic analysis so they can then be in a position  to tailor these products well?  I suppose on the data part of that first, everyone's got that data.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:24):**  If you don't have it at your fingertips, the accountant will have it.  They know how much money you've made out of stock, how much money you've made out of crop.  Even if you don't have a detailed analysis on your accounting software, you'll be able  
**[0:09:34-0:09:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:34):**  to get it from your accountant.  And the BOM's already recording all of that data.  Most farmers are actually really great at recording their rainfall data.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:43):**  Just putting that from a rainfall chart into Excel and being able to analyse that financial  data and the environmental data.  And it may not be rainfall, it may be heat, too much heat at the end of your canola flowering  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:57):**  or frost, or it's not necessarily rainfall.  I suppose the thing that's driving us fairly early in our farming careers and like we've  got two businesses in farming, you've got a production business and a land business.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:12):**  That land business is increasing in value every single year, no matter if you get out  of bed or not.  The production business is the thing that we spend a lot of our time in.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:22):**  But if the production business fails, it's easy to just go and say, oh, we've got a bit  more equity this year.  So it doesn't matter, we can borrow a bit more money.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:32):**  I suppose our view on that is that we don't want to be doing that.  We want to be limiting the risks in the production business every year, which we can do that  with this insurance policy.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:44):**  And being able to take all the emotional decisions out of this and put some metrics in our production  business so that we can grow both these businesses quick as we possibly can for the next generation.  That kind of Excel noodling and stuff you talked about there, what skills you already  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:04):**  had, was that stuff that came from your kind of business and marketing background, that  just interested in that willingness to really dig in and use the data to build a model that  then helps you buy the parametric insurance things less common?  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:18):**  I think you've got to want to delve into numbers like that.  I know it's not for everyone.  Everyone's very different in that aspect.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:24):**  That's just something that I enjoy doing.  And I love taking the emotion out of things.  I'm not an emotional decision maker at all.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:32):**  The numbers never lie.  If it's making money with your numbers, then yeah, emotion has a little part to play in  it, but not a lot.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:39):**  There's no room for emotion like that in farming, I don't think.  It's probably come from a bit of my background, but yeah, basically it's just the want to  make sure that you're not losing out in those big years and not losing out in the really  
**[0:11:52-0:11:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:52):**  poor years either.  Do you see, you mentioned where there's a big difference between you being willing to  do this yourself versus helping other people to do it and the degree to which they're actually  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:03):**  motivated to do that?  If you're at a barbecue, having a chat with friends and family, are you kind of, there  goes time without insurance again, or is it a sort of thing that would come up in conversation?  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:17):**  Would people say that it's a bit of an obsession of yours or just interested to know how it  goes?  It comes into a fair bit of it.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:23):**  Like when you're doing planning, harvest, logistics and stuff like that, geez, we can't  get that extra header for harvest this year.  Say to put it into context, if we're struggling to find that extra header, so we'll, okay,  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:35):**  we've got this insurance policy.  So we've hedged against part of the risk that if we don't get it all off, we are still covered.  We will cover that downgrade.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:46):**  So it does come into the logistical and operational talk all the time.  And yeah, it has become not so much an obsession.  It's just a tool to help us with our planning of what goes on in this farm.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:03):**  Sometimes when I'm using tools that I'm not super familiar with, the experience can be  a bit suboptimal on other occasions or what have you learnt with using parametric as a  tool that are maybe some positives or some notable negatives in terms of how it works  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:17):**  or not fully understanding the edge cases of how it works.  The guys that are offering these policies in Australia, they're fantastic with helping.  Like all I want to see is this go big in ag.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:33):**  So they're very happy to help tailor things for you.  But again, they'll sit there and say, I don't know what's going to make your business tick.  I don't know the backstory of why you're trying to do this.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:43):**  Even if I did, I probably can't tailor it anymore.  You've got to put the legwork in and work out what you are trying to do.  But I suppose the unknown in the past was they plug everything into their software and  
**[0:13:56-0:13:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:56):**  spit out a quote for you.  If it's, say, you're trying to insure for too much rainfall, moving your insurance period  by a matter of days, either side of where you want it to be could be the difference  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:14:08):**  of five or 10% in premium, given what's happened in the past.  So being able to talk to those guys and explain what we're trying to do and then them trying  to build your policy where you can get the best value for money and what percent premium  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:14:26):**  you're willing to pay to cover that risk.  Now that can change every year, depending on what your situation is.  I've been a part of, I suppose a bit more backstory, a part of the New South Wales Farmers  
**[0:14:39-0:14:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:14:39):**  Grains Committee for a number of years.  I'm not on it this year, but have been in the past.  And a part of me being on there was trying to see where this could go.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:14:49):**  Instead of giving out money for the drought, what appetite did the government have to step  in and say, yeah, let's help underwrite these policies and these products so that we're  not handing out money in droughts or floods, or let's let everyone, educate everyone to  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:07):**  take the step and do it themselves.  We ended up getting money out of the New South Wales government to run a pilot program and  do a bit of research into this.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:16):**  The NFF got the money and ran it.  I was a little bit disappointed with the outcome.  And I don't know whether there's only a certain percentage of the population who are worried  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:26):**  about insuring this.  Some guys put money in FMDs as a bit of risk management.  Some guys will hedge currency.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:34):**  Some guys will have off-farm investments, however they want to play it.  So there's a bit of discussion to be had there about how everyone is hedging their risk.  And everyone is different too.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:45):**  But no one's really hedging their risk in a production sense, like with the weather.  And the weather and emotional decision making are the two biggest risks we have.  A couple of things that seem worth digging into there.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:57):**  The first would be the farm data side.  You mentioned obviously there, people do have it, maybe they don't manage it or it's not  all brought together.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:07):**  One of the things that we talk about is there's probably a lot more to gain from being less  worried about bringing data together than there is to be lost.  You see there being possibilities for these services to extend in that idea of parametric  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:22):**  insurance, like helping with that problem of bringing all that data together in a way  that you can do more of this kind of scenario modeling to save people having to get in and  jump into Excel and do it on themselves.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:35):**  I was only talking about this the other day.  Farm data, it's like Isobus, hooking tractors to implements.  It all sounds great until you actually go and do it and then it sounds horrible and  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:47):**  it is horrible.  There's no platform where we can store all of this stuff nicely.  Like I understand why, not having a go at anyone.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:55):**  It's all in different formats where everyone wants different things and there's different  outputs and inputs.  Until we've got a place where we can store all of this stuff, I think we've really got  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:17:10):**  our heads in the sand.  We're trying to integrate some of these things.  So we've got some Goanna private weather stations.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:17:17):**  Now with the guys who do our parametric insurance, we said to them, we put a, last year we put  our interpolated grid over one of the grid points was right on top of our weather station.  So we said, let's do a bit of a trial and let's see how this plays out because the parametric  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:17:36):**  insurance is done on interpolated data.  Our rain gauge said one thing, the interpolated data said another thing and that cost us about  $250,000 because our rain gauge physically recorded what happened, but the interpolated  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:17:53):**  data didn't agree.  So what we're trying to do, and my point is that everyone is sceptical in agriculture,  aren't they?  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:01):**  I think we can throw a blanket over everyone and say everyone's pretty sceptical, especially  of new things.  And we've got the same scepticism in our business.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:08):**  Now I'm sitting there saying, no, we signed a contract on interpolated data.  So now we're doing a retrospectively looking at what the interpolation said and what our  Goanna station said.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:17):**  So we're trying to get the reinsurers to come to the party and go, well, okay, that's correlated  enough in the past to progress this forward.  Let's now say let's come up with an agreement that if the interpolated data and the private  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:33):**  weather station data correlate within X percent, then everyone's happy.  We'll use the data off the weather station.  If there is a big discrepancy, how do we handle that discrepancy?  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:46):**  And I think once we push through that barrier, then everyone can go, my rain gauge is there,  it's rained, so that's my policy.  And you're really still sceptical, go and put a manual gauge next to it.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:59):**  Like if you really want to make the data more credible in your own eyes.  But yeah, I think we need to push through some of those data barriers yet to really  make all this stuff on, but we're just not there yet.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:10):**  There's no platform to make this work.  I don't know.  And I don't know what the answer is.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:14):**  I'd love it if someone could tell me.  It is a tough one, as you say, and the scepticism that's there.  We try to dig into that too, in terms of what is this fear that sometimes attends the whole  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:24):**  people back and you pointed to one problem or another class of problems, which is that  it's actually technically hard.  Like the data isn't in the same format and ones in inches and ones in millimetres and  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:34):**  all that kind of stuff.  But then secondarily that, I suppose, fear to some extent of, well, if I share it with  this mob, then is that going to come back to bite me?  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:45):**  I think you've just given a really positive example of if the reinsurer is prepared to  take yours and nearby weather station data to improve their model, it's a better result.  Right.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:56):**  It gives you a better result.  That's the point we're making about the difference between generally sharing data in a supply  chain sense versus specifically for insurance, because it's pretty clear in your, that example  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:07):**  you just gave where, okay, the reinsurer has got to get comfortable, but once they're comfortable,  it's clearly better for both parties that we agree on what is more accurate, more regional,  more local and therefore properly represents the risk that you're exposed to.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:23):**  That's right.  There is positives and negatives to sharing data.  As you said, that's a positive example.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:28):**  A negative example is private stocks reporting of grain supplies, but they can't be, they're  not one and the same.  You can't just say data and then, oh, I know data is bad because of this.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:40):**  It's all specific to what you're trying to do.  Another kind of question I had is, so you talked there, another fantastic example of  that incidence of where the rain event that you were actually exposed to was different  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:54):**  and we know that weather is variable, especially sub-regions and all that sort of thing, but  also we have this overlay of increased variability that is coming along with a changing climate.  And you talked about before, like sliding the dialer up and a two week change made a  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:21:12):**  very significant policy difference.  What are your thoughts there about that sort of unpredictability of pricing?  There was an article yesterday on ABC news about insurance policy prices in areas just  
**[0:21:25-0:21:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:21:25):**  becoming too much for people.  What are your thoughts there in terms of parametric and that idea of pricing A being hard to know  upfront and B as whether risk likelihoods increase, surely policy prices have to go  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:21:40):**  up?  Insurance can be as cheap or as expensive as you want it to be, especially if parametric  because you're coming up with metrics.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:21:49):**  So how much risk do you want to ensure that will reflect the price of the policy?  You know, house insurance sense, if you live somewhere where they have recorded a flood  two times in every 10 years, of course your insurance is going to be expensive.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:05):**  If expensive insurance is your main concern, sell and go and live on top of a hill.  Your insurance will be cheaper every time.  It's the same in parametric insurance.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:15):**  If you want to ensure you're going to get above average rainfall five years out of 10,  then your insurance will be very expensive.  But if you want to ensure decile one and decile 10 or both of them, then it will be cheap  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:27):**  because its incidence is so low.  So you can make it whatever you like.  And I can say, I want to make sure we're going to have an 800 mil rainfall this year.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:36):**  We're already at 580.  So probably not much point me ensuring that because A we're halfway through the year and  we're nearly there, our moisture profile will carry us through anyway.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:49):**  And the chance of us getting 800 mil a year is like two out of 10.  It is going to be expensive.  The way I can see us pricing these policies, and this is after a bit of experience with  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:00):**  them, our main risk is no rain.  That's if you look back in history, we are drier than we are wetter.  And you can't get too cute with how we work this out because you'll drive yourself insane.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:11):**  You won't be able to find an answer.  So we've got to be a little bit broad with that and say, okay, if we don't get 60 mil  of rain every quarter, then every quarter is a payout situation.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:22):**  So we pay a premium every quarter, and that might be a bank guaranteed premium over five  years.  And if we get our 60 mil, great, that's fantastic.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:31):**  We're halfway to average every quarter if we get that.  If we don't, then we know that there'll be whatever the value of the policy will be,  $250,000 every quarter coming in.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:43):**  That makes me think you talked about people's, whether it's interest or skill ability, you  also referred to the company that you work with there.  They're pretty good at helping out.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:54):**  It feels like there is a kind of role there where the digitally native version of an agronomist  should have just as much familiarity with these tools as on the agronomy side because  of those increased production risks that everybody's going to be exposed to.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:13):**  Do you think that's where as this grows, people will source that kind of skill from?  As the appetite grows, there will have to be someone sitting in the middle there, I  suppose.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:23):**  I've asked this of a state agribusiness manager, where do you guys see yourselves fitting into  this?  We're spending money to ensure that paying back any liabilities to you.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:35):**  We don't have to do that, we have no obligation to do that.  His answer was, look, we really don't know anything about this.  I said, okay, let's put it in a different term.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:45):**  If we're spending this money to ensure you're getting your money back, can you give us a  cut in your margin?  Because we're being more responsible.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:52):**  He said, we've really got no appetite for that.  We already know we can get our money back and you're not a risk to us anyway, so it  doesn't really matter.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:00):**  So that is a really poor answer to what's trying to happen here.  Would you lend harder if we had a five year policy to ensure that we had X money coming  in if it didn't rain?  
**[0:25:12-0:25:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:12):**  He said, no, probably not.  That's what I wish we'd go and find someone who does align with their values.  And another one of the things we imagine with parametric, because it's easy to deliver visually,  
**[0:25:23-0:25:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:23):**  is whether or not the extension of parametric style insurance might shift to somewhere else.  In your supply universe, one of the things that seems at least logical would be if you're  forward contracting your grain, the aggregator or whoever you're striking that forward contract  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:42):**  with, they know obviously what grain, what variety, they know where you are, they know  roughly what abiotic stress is at what point in your season will represent a risk to them.  Can you see a world potentially where we move to that sort of more embedded style of insurance?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:58):**  Like when you check out at an airline booking service and it says, do you want travel insurance  with that kind of thing?  Yes.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:05):**  So that's already happening, but I suppose to put it in broad terms, like that grain  Corp say in the drought a couple of years ago, they had a parametric product where if  East Coast grain production dropped below X hundreds of thousands of tonnes, I can't  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:20):**  remember exactly what the parameter was, then they received a payout.  And I think it was somewhere in excess of $80 million.  Yes, I do remember that one.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:31):**  Yep.  Yeah.  And that was otherwise had a pretty bad time leading up to that, I think.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:36):**  And then that was a significant payday.  That was a pretty crafty insurance policy.  So they're doing that on their scale in terms that they don't need to come down to individual  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:46):**  scale.  There's a lot of admin involved in trying to do that.  So I can't see how that, I suppose it could work.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:56):**  You can never say, can't see how it would work.  We can't see how it would work now, but there'd be a solution to it for sure.  That's one thing that we often wonder about too, which is that sometimes after people  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:09):**  like yourself start using this product, you actually end up using it in a different way  than what you thought you were going to do with it when you started, because these products  often by their nature are actually more adaptable.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:21):**  And then at some point you'll go, Oh, wait on, I could do X and Y.  Have you had any experiences like that, where you've found that that kind of additional  level of flexibility suited a scenario that you wasn't necessarily one of the ones you  
**[0:27:38-0:27:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:38):**  were thinking about from the outset?  Hail, traditional hail and we all know traditional hail and fire insurance.  We had a conversation about hail and it's already happening parametrically.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:49):**  So it's very hard to independently measure hail size and intensity that's done after  the fact with traditional hail and fire.  Someone says it comes out, has a look generally trying to take them to the worst part of the  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:00):**  paddock.  So you don't get excessed out of your pay app, but with the parametric insurance growing  they are trialing hail sensing pads in orchards in the States.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:12):**  And that's measuring intensity and size of hail.  So we are hopefully going to be trialing that this year on one paddock.  We're just working out what it'll cost traditionally compared to what it'll cost with these sensing  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:27):**  pads.  And yeah, we'll do a trial on it this year.  I never ever thought that would be a possibility because how do you measure hail size intensity  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:36):**  rather than standing out in it or seeing that your crops wiped out the next day.  And that was another thing that seemed pretty fundamental in terms of just the economics  of how parametric insurance could eventually work that you don't need an assessor to go  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:52):**  out there, right?  You don't need someone to come and estimate the actual loss that occurred.  It's simply the event did or did not occur.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:59):**  And you have previously agreed that what you'll get paid when that event happens.  And it'll be a whole lot cheaper to do that at large scale if lots of people want to jump  on board.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:09):**  Yeah, absolutely.  We're not waiting around for an assessor or with the multi peril running a header through  a paddock to get yield data to say that you didn't have enough there to bother harvesting  
**[0:29:19-0:29:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:19):**  it.  Like that's antiquated, isn't it?  So yeah, it is adaptable to big scale.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:25):**  That's exactly right.  Because you don't need that manpower where the data comes in.  If everyone can trust the data and there's a platform for trusting the data, then there's  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:32):**  no reason it can't be scaled very quickly.  A kind of final question, you briefly touched on what the future of parametric might look  like.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:42):**  You've obviously had more experience with it the most and you've referred to needing  kind of strong service providers who can help.  Looking a little further ahead, do you have a vision for what the future of parametric  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:54):**  can be?  Are you touched on the hail thing?  Is there stuff that's further out on the horizon that you're pretty keen to see?  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:00):**  I hope I don't know the answer to that question.  I'm glad I don't because there's someone smarter than me thinking about it somewhere, hopefully.  The options are endless.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:09):**  If you can find a way to measure it independently and the reinsurer is happy with it, that's  the only limits.  One of the things that we've also thought a bit about there is almost like the emergence  
**[0:30:22-0:30:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:22):**  of kind of really specialised reinsurers.  The more data you can get access to, the more likely it seems that you can build pretty  specific models that aren't just generally about weather but specifically might be kilos  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:36):**  of weight gain in a particular breed of cattle on a grassland system.  Do you see it going that far potentially?  I don't think it can go that far.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:47):**  Again, not being negative, I hope it could get to that but just from what I know of how  the reinsurers like their data, that's not going to be measured and it's not going to  be specific and independently measured unless it's a walkover weighing system or something  
**[0:31:04-0:31:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:04):**  like that.  I think probably where it's going to stay until there's enough uptake in that situation  is, well, that producer knows what he can do if he's got grass.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:14):**  As far as weight gain goes, grass production is driven by rain and sunlight so if we don't  have rain, we don't get grass, we don't get weight gain.  So I think if you're measuring that weight gain to that point, you'll be able to work  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:26):**  it backwards and go, the rain is the easiest one at the moment.  If they want to come to the party and do walkover weighing some sort of an algorithm to work  that into a policy, I'd love to see that.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:36):**  That'd be great.  This conversation was so absolutely jam-packed with insight, it was honestly hard to choose  but a couple of things that Tom mentioned have really stuck with us.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:46):**  First, I really like the distinction Tom made between his land business and his production  business and the trap that it's easy to fall into of subsidizing an unnecessarily high-risk  production operation with the margins and equity of a land business.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:00):**  It seems that this conscious division of the businesses helped Tom understand the need  and the opportunity in limiting his risk on the farming side, which is helping him make  both sides of his business be more successful.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:12):**  Then I loved the idea that the greatest risks to Tom's farm are weather and emotion, especially  because those two things are so often caught up together.  Tom has been able to use parametric insurance products to mitigate his risk on both fronts,  
**[0:32:25-0:32:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:25):**  but it's taken a lot of effort and learning.  Which brings me to a final takeaway about how important the data, the knowledge, and  the deep understanding of his business have been in Tom's journey into the parametric  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:36):**  insurance world.  Despite the significant upside that's possible with these products, I think it's clear that  they are not for the casual dabbler.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:44):**  In my mind, two pressures are going to alter that over time.  On the one hand, I think economic and financial pressure will continue to favor farmers like  Tom and disempower others who don't want to make the investments in data and know-how.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:57):**  On the other hand, I also think the current wave of ag tech we're in will require, and  maybe even bring with it, a serious upskilling for farmers and their teams of staff and advisors.  So that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.

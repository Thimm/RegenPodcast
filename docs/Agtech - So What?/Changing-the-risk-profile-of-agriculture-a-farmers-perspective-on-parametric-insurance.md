**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by Tenacious Ventures.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:06):**  I'm Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:08):**  One of the things we love most about our podcast is the opportunity it gives us to learn from  
**[0:00:13-0:00:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:13):**  our listeners.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:14):**  Back in June of this year, we made the decision to learn out loud about the future of risk  
**[0:00:19-0:00:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:19):**  and insurance in agriculture.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:21):**  It was a three-part series that honestly came from our own digging around, reaching out  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:25):**  to experts in our network and testing hypotheses with each other out in the open.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:31):**  And during the series, we were pumped to hear from a listener who seemed to be as interested  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:35):**  as we were in the challenges and opportunities within ag insurance as it exists today.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:40):**  I've asked this of a state agribusiness manager, we're spending money to ensure that we're  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:48):**  paying back any liabilities to you.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:50):**  Can you give us a cut in our margin?  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:52):**  And his answer was, oh, we've really got no appetite for that.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:00:56):**  We already know we can get our money back and you're not a risk to us anyway, so it  
**[0:01:00-0:01:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:00):**  doesn't really matter.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:01):**  So that is a really poor answer.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:03):**  Maybe we should go and find someone who does align with our values.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:07):**  That's Tom Ferguson.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:08):**  He's a farmer in Northern New South Wales.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:10):**  And after listening to one of our episodes about parametric insurance, Tom reached out  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:14):**  to share his experience as a farmer and policyholder and the work he's done learning about insurance  
**[0:01:19-0:01:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:19):**  to reduce risk on his own operation.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:22):**  Tom recently sat down with my occasional cohost and co-founder at Tenacious Ventures, Matthew  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:28):**  Pryor, to share his experience for the benefit of our learning and our theories on where  
**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:33):**  the insurance industry might be headed.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:35):**  We found his insights so relevant, especially in the wake of our previous insurance discussions,  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:40):**  that we asked Tom's permission to share them with all of you.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:43):**  I'll drop you in here where Tom gets into his early explorations of using insurance  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:47):**  on his farm.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:48):**  I took on the role of managing the cropping and that's where the risk management for us  
**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:55):**  really started to wind up.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:01:57):**  We've been through until two years ago, like 15, 16 were two of the best years we'd ever  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:05):**  seen.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:06):**  And then 17, 18, 19 were three of the worst years ever recorded here.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:13):**  So we saw the huge fluctuation in seasonal variability, which we both say monthly that  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:20):**  it was the best thing that could have ever happened to us because it's made us understand  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:24):**  the risks that we play with.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:25):**  And now we're going into potentially what could be one of the wettest years.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:29):**  So how we go about managing this risk is probably top of mind to me.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:34):**  I suppose in many years gone by with the risk in farming, people haven't really taken a  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:40):**  proactive step to try and manage that risk.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:43):**  So that's become a big part of what we do every day.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:46):**  So what are the specific circumstances that represent those kinds of risks in the weather  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:51):**  and climate sense?  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:53):**  The leading one is lack of rainfall.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:55):**  Our production is driven off stored fallow moisture.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:02:58):**  So lack of rainfall through the summer months, then lack of rainfall through our growing  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:05):**  season.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:06):**  This year it has been too much rain at planting.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:08):**  We haven't physically been able to get the crop in the ground, but that's probably specific  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:13):**  to 10% of years or 5% of years.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:16):**  And probably the other one is rain at harvest.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:19):**  So degrading yields and quality at harvest time is probably the other main drama we have.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:25):**  When did you start understanding why Parametric Insurance was a good match for those kinds  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:32):**  of risks that you were exposed to?  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:34):**  Parametric Insurance has been around commercially for 30 plus years in Australia.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:40):**  It's just never been delivered to Ag.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:42):**  I don't know what that reason is.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:44):**  There's a fairly high lack of uptake with all of these products.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:49):**  So the insurances that first started getting roll on the multi-parrel insurances, and that's  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:53):**  where we started with this.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:03:56):**  I don't think anyone's offering a multi-parrel in Australia anymore because the model was  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:01):**  flawed.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:02):**  We got five out of six payouts.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:05):**  So there's a problem with that model.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:07):**  The whole idea of insurance is you don't want to claim every year and everyone has a different  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:11):**  opinion on this, but the idea is to take out the highs and lows.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:15):**  We want to buffer ourselves from the extreme.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:17):**  So those multi-parrel products, the fact they are paying out so often meant that you were  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:25):**  playing in the wrong space.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:26):**  They're trying to cover too many perils for the premium.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:30):**  So going into the Parametric Insurance, you're able to tailor.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:35):**  So the multi-parrel, I suppose I should clarify this, it covers every peril.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:40):**  It's on a dollar per hectare agreed value.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:43):**  If you don't meet that value, they will top up.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:45):**  So when we start looking at Parametric Insurance, we are then having to go, it's not every parameter.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:53):**  It's either excess rain, lack of rain, hail is coming into Parametric Insurance.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:04:59):**  If it's specifically and independently measured, they will generally write a policy on it.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:04):**  So then it's back to the farmer or the consumer of that product to work out what the risk  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:11):**  is in their business.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:13):**  As we dug into that more, it felt like maybe there were two aspects about why things like  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:20):**  multi-parrel or more traditional forms of insurance were CAFO.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:24):**  The first is, as you say, if the policy is paying out all the time, like it's going to  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:28):**  be expensive for everybody.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:30):**  But the second also is it seemed maybe before a lot of this stuff was more digital, the  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:36):**  tailoring part perhaps was harder to do for a lot of people.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:40):**  Like you had to have an agronomist or a specialized salesperson who could work with you to help  
**[0:05:46-0:05:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:46):**  you tailor it.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:47):**  Whereas maybe a bit more these days, the more modern products, perhaps, and I'd be interested  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:52):**  in how you take delivery of these products, but the ones we've seen that you can actually  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:05:56):**  get on a kind of dashboard and dial it up a bit and say, these are the specific events  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:00):**  that I'm interested in and this is how I want to tailor it specifically for me.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:05):**  That's right.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:06):**  Before there is someone selling you that product, you have to know in your business what risks  
**[0:06:10-0:06:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:10):**  you're facing.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:11):**  No one can tell you that.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:13):**  So the process that we went back and we started looking at income and expenses per millimetre  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:19):**  of rain over 25 years of financial data and looking at those big ticks, what made that  
**[0:06:25-0:06:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:25):**  boom or what made that bust.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:27):**  And then looking at our fallow rain to our in-crop rain and trying to decide where our  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:32):**  biggest risks were and then coupling that with, right, our biggest risk for the last  
**[0:06:37-0:06:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:37):**  couple of years has been excess rain and harvest.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:39):**  Let's look at that specific period.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:41):**  And this is not something anyone's going to be able to tell you.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:43):**  And every farm will generally probably be different given their location in the country.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:49):**  But we know that if we've got a ripe crop sitting there on the 25th of October, our  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:54):**  proportion of early crop is 30%.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:06:58):**  So it is going to be the ripest.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:07:00):**  If we get a storm in that time, and it dumps 20ml of rain on us, and October is generally  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:07:08):**  starting, well it is getting hot.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:07:10):**  So 25ml if the sun comes out two hours later or the next day, that will not put us in a  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:07:18):**  situation where we are losing quality.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:07:23):**  What happens though, a couple of storms in a row, then that puts us in a situation where  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:07:30):**  we're sprouting, we're losing test weight, we're losing quality and we're losing money.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:07:35):**  So that's the first risk is that we get days of rain together.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:07:38):**  And the other risk is we live on a gigantic floodplain.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:07:42):**  So what happens if we get a huge amount of rain in the six weeks that we are trying to  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:07:48):**  harvest, which makes the ground completely untrafficable?  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:07:52):**  And that might be 80ml of rain or 100ml of rain in that time period.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:07:56):**  So trying to see what makes our business tick.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:02):**  On the flip side to the end of 2019, when the drought was really biting hard, we decided  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:08):**  to take out one for rain.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:11):**  So the complete opposite, we're trying to hedge against it raining, now we're hedging  
**[0:08:15-0:08:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:15):**  for it to rain.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:17):**  And we said if we can get 120ml of rain in this period, that'll get us out of trouble,  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:22):**  we'll have enough moisture to plant sheep feed.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:26):**  And we ended up with 80ml and we grew enough feed to keep us through the next two months  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:31):**  until it actually started raining again.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:33):**  So it's about knowing your production system and what you need, and then hedging against  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:39):**  the biggest risk in that concept and that idea that you're trying to get through.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:44):**  You also mentioned there coming in doing this economic analysis over a pretty long period  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:48):**  with the data.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:49):**  That sparked two questions for me, the first, is there anything you think in your background  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:08:55):**  or your kind of journey into being in this role that made you perhaps more interested  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:01):**  or willing to do that kind of analysis?  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:04):**  And secondarily, how hard was it to bring all that data together?  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:08):**  And when you think about other people doing that, what are the kind of enablers or blockers  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:13):**  to allow people to be able to do that basic analysis so they can then be in a position  
**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:18):**  to tailor these products well?  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:19):**  I suppose on the data part of that first, everyone's got that data.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:24):**  If you don't have it at your fingertips, the accountant will have it.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:27):**  They know how much money you've made out of stock, how much money you've made out of crop.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:30):**  Even if you don't have a detailed analysis on your accounting software, you'll be able  
**[0:09:34-0:09:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:34):**  to get it from your accountant.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:36):**  And the BOM's already recording all of that data.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:39):**  Most farmers are actually really great at recording their rainfall data.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:43):**  Just putting that from a rainfall chart into Excel and being able to analyse that financial  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:49):**  data and the environmental data.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:52):**  And it may not be rainfall, it may be heat, too much heat at the end of your canola flowering  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:09:57):**  or frost, or it's not necessarily rainfall.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:00):**  I suppose the thing that's driving us fairly early in our farming careers and like we've  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:08):**  got two businesses in farming, you've got a production business and a land business.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:12):**  That land business is increasing in value every single year, no matter if you get out  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:16):**  of bed or not.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:17):**  The production business is the thing that we spend a lot of our time in.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:22):**  But if the production business fails, it's easy to just go and say, oh, we've got a bit  
**[0:10:29-0:10:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:29):**  more equity this year.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:30):**  So it doesn't matter, we can borrow a bit more money.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:32):**  I suppose our view on that is that we don't want to be doing that.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:36):**  We want to be limiting the risks in the production business every year, which we can do that  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:42):**  with this insurance policy.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:44):**  And being able to take all the emotional decisions out of this and put some metrics in our production  
**[0:10:52-0:11:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:10:52):**  business so that we can grow both these businesses quick as we possibly can for the next generation.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:00):**  That kind of Excel noodling and stuff you talked about there, what skills you already  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:04):**  had, was that stuff that came from your kind of business and marketing background, that  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:07):**  just interested in that willingness to really dig in and use the data to build a model that  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:12):**  then helps you buy the parametric insurance things less common?  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:18):**  I think you've got to want to delve into numbers like that.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:21):**  I know it's not for everyone.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:22):**  Everyone's very different in that aspect.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:24):**  That's just something that I enjoy doing.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:27):**  And I love taking the emotion out of things.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:29):**  I'm not an emotional decision maker at all.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:32):**  The numbers never lie.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:33):**  If it's making money with your numbers, then yeah, emotion has a little part to play in  
**[0:11:38-0:11:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:38):**  it, but not a lot.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:39):**  There's no room for emotion like that in farming, I don't think.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:43):**  It's probably come from a bit of my background, but yeah, basically it's just the want to  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:47):**  make sure that you're not losing out in those big years and not losing out in the really  
**[0:11:52-0:11:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:52):**  poor years either.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:53):**  Do you see, you mentioned where there's a big difference between you being willing to  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:11:58):**  do this yourself versus helping other people to do it and the degree to which they're actually  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:03):**  motivated to do that?  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:04):**  If you're at a barbecue, having a chat with friends and family, are you kind of, there  
**[0:12:09-0:12:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:09):**  goes time without insurance again, or is it a sort of thing that would come up in conversation?  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:17):**  Would people say that it's a bit of an obsession of yours or just interested to know how it  
**[0:12:21-0:12:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:21):**  goes?  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:22):**  It comes into a fair bit of it.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:23):**  Like when you're doing planning, harvest, logistics and stuff like that, geez, we can't  
**[0:12:28-0:12:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:28):**  get that extra header for harvest this year.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:30):**  Say to put it into context, if we're struggling to find that extra header, so we'll, okay,  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:35):**  we've got this insurance policy.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:37):**  So we've hedged against part of the risk that if we don't get it all off, we are still covered.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:43):**  We will cover that downgrade.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:46):**  So it does come into the logistical and operational talk all the time.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:51):**  And yeah, it has become not so much an obsession.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:12:56):**  It's just a tool to help us with our planning of what goes on in this farm.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:03):**  Sometimes when I'm using tools that I'm not super familiar with, the experience can be  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:07):**  a bit suboptimal on other occasions or what have you learnt with using parametric as a  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:11):**  tool that are maybe some positives or some notable negatives in terms of how it works  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:17):**  or not fully understanding the edge cases of how it works.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:23):**  The guys that are offering these policies in Australia, they're fantastic with helping.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:30):**  Like all I want to see is this go big in ag.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:33):**  So they're very happy to help tailor things for you.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:36):**  But again, they'll sit there and say, I don't know what's going to make your business tick.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:41):**  I don't know the backstory of why you're trying to do this.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:43):**  Even if I did, I probably can't tailor it anymore.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:46):**  You've got to put the legwork in and work out what you are trying to do.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:50):**  But I suppose the unknown in the past was they plug everything into their software and  
**[0:13:56-0:13:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:56):**  spit out a quote for you.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:13:58):**  If it's, say, you're trying to insure for too much rainfall, moving your insurance period  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:14:04):**  by a matter of days, either side of where you want it to be could be the difference  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:14:08):**  of five or 10% in premium, given what's happened in the past.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:14:13):**  So being able to talk to those guys and explain what we're trying to do and then them trying  
**[0:14:19-0:14:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:14:19):**  to build your policy where you can get the best value for money and what percent premium  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:14:26):**  you're willing to pay to cover that risk.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:14:28):**  Now that can change every year, depending on what your situation is.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:14:33):**  I've been a part of, I suppose a bit more backstory, a part of the New South Wales Farmers  
**[0:14:39-0:14:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:14:39):**  Grains Committee for a number of years.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:14:41):**  I'm not on it this year, but have been in the past.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:14:44):**  And a part of me being on there was trying to see where this could go.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:14:49):**  Instead of giving out money for the drought, what appetite did the government have to step  
**[0:14:54-0:15:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:14:54):**  in and say, yeah, let's help underwrite these policies and these products so that we're  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:01):**  not handing out money in droughts or floods, or let's let everyone, educate everyone to  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:07):**  take the step and do it themselves.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:09):**  We ended up getting money out of the New South Wales government to run a pilot program and  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:15):**  do a bit of research into this.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:16):**  The NFF got the money and ran it.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:19):**  I was a little bit disappointed with the outcome.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:21):**  And I don't know whether there's only a certain percentage of the population who are worried  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:26):**  about insuring this.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:28):**  Some guys put money in FMDs as a bit of risk management.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:31):**  Some guys will hedge currency.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:34):**  Some guys will have off-farm investments, however they want to play it.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:38):**  So there's a bit of discussion to be had there about how everyone is hedging their risk.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:43):**  And everyone is different too.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:45):**  But no one's really hedging their risk in a production sense, like with the weather.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:51):**  And the weather and emotional decision making are the two biggest risks we have.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:55):**  A couple of things that seem worth digging into there.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:15:57):**  The first would be the farm data side.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:01):**  You mentioned obviously there, people do have it, maybe they don't manage it or it's not  
**[0:16:06-0:16:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:06):**  all brought together.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:07):**  One of the things that we talk about is there's probably a lot more to gain from being less  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:13):**  worried about bringing data together than there is to be lost.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:16):**  You see there being possibilities for these services to extend in that idea of parametric  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:22):**  insurance, like helping with that problem of bringing all that data together in a way  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:27):**  that you can do more of this kind of scenario modeling to save people having to get in and  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:32):**  jump into Excel and do it on themselves.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:35):**  I was only talking about this the other day.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:39):**  Farm data, it's like Isobus, hooking tractors to implements.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:42):**  It all sounds great until you actually go and do it and then it sounds horrible and  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:47):**  it is horrible.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:48):**  There's no platform where we can store all of this stuff nicely.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:51):**  Like I understand why, not having a go at anyone.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:55):**  It's all in different formats where everyone wants different things and there's different  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:16:59):**  outputs and inputs.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:17:03):**  Until we've got a place where we can store all of this stuff, I think we've really got  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:17:10):**  our heads in the sand.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:17:11):**  We're trying to integrate some of these things.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:17:13):**  So we've got some Goanna private weather stations.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:17:17):**  Now with the guys who do our parametric insurance, we said to them, we put a, last year we put  
**[0:17:24-0:17:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:17:24):**  our interpolated grid over one of the grid points was right on top of our weather station.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:17:32):**  So we said, let's do a bit of a trial and let's see how this plays out because the parametric  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:17:36):**  insurance is done on interpolated data.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:17:39):**  Our rain gauge said one thing, the interpolated data said another thing and that cost us about  
**[0:17:45-0:17:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:17:45):**  $250,000 because our rain gauge physically recorded what happened, but the interpolated  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:17:53):**  data didn't agree.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:17:56):**  So what we're trying to do, and my point is that everyone is sceptical in agriculture,  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:00):**  aren't they?  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:01):**  I think we can throw a blanket over everyone and say everyone's pretty sceptical, especially  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:04):**  of new things.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:05):**  And we've got the same scepticism in our business.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:08):**  Now I'm sitting there saying, no, we signed a contract on interpolated data.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:12):**  So now we're doing a retrospectively looking at what the interpolation said and what our  
**[0:18:16-0:18:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:16):**  Goanna station said.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:17):**  So we're trying to get the reinsurers to come to the party and go, well, okay, that's correlated  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:22):**  enough in the past to progress this forward.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:26):**  Let's now say let's come up with an agreement that if the interpolated data and the private  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:33):**  weather station data correlate within X percent, then everyone's happy.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:39):**  We'll use the data off the weather station.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:42):**  If there is a big discrepancy, how do we handle that discrepancy?  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:46):**  And I think once we push through that barrier, then everyone can go, my rain gauge is there,  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:52):**  it's rained, so that's my policy.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:55):**  And you're really still sceptical, go and put a manual gauge next to it.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:18:59):**  Like if you really want to make the data more credible in your own eyes.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:04):**  But yeah, I think we need to push through some of those data barriers yet to really  
**[0:19:08-0:19:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:08):**  make all this stuff on, but we're just not there yet.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:10):**  There's no platform to make this work.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:12):**  I don't know.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:13):**  And I don't know what the answer is.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:14):**  I'd love it if someone could tell me.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:16):**  It is a tough one, as you say, and the scepticism that's there.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:19):**  We try to dig into that too, in terms of what is this fear that sometimes attends the whole  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:24):**  people back and you pointed to one problem or another class of problems, which is that  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:29):**  it's actually technically hard.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:30):**  Like the data isn't in the same format and ones in inches and ones in millimetres and  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:34):**  all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:35):**  But then secondarily that, I suppose, fear to some extent of, well, if I share it with  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:42):**  this mob, then is that going to come back to bite me?  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:45):**  I think you've just given a really positive example of if the reinsurer is prepared to  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:51):**  take yours and nearby weather station data to improve their model, it's a better result.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:55):**  Right.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:56):**  It gives you a better result.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:19:57):**  That's the point we're making about the difference between generally sharing data in a supply  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:02):**  chain sense versus specifically for insurance, because it's pretty clear in your, that example  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:07):**  you just gave where, okay, the reinsurer has got to get comfortable, but once they're comfortable,  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:12):**  it's clearly better for both parties that we agree on what is more accurate, more regional,  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:17):**  more local and therefore properly represents the risk that you're exposed to.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:23):**  That's right.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:24):**  There is positives and negatives to sharing data.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:26):**  As you said, that's a positive example.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:28):**  A negative example is private stocks reporting of grain supplies, but they can't be, they're  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:34):**  not one and the same.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:35):**  You can't just say data and then, oh, I know data is bad because of this.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:40):**  It's all specific to what you're trying to do.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:44):**  Another kind of question I had is, so you talked there, another fantastic example of  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:49):**  that incidence of where the rain event that you were actually exposed to was different  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:54):**  and we know that weather is variable, especially sub-regions and all that sort of thing, but  
**[0:20:59-0:21:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:20:59):**  also we have this overlay of increased variability that is coming along with a changing climate.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:21:07):**  And you talked about before, like sliding the dialer up and a two week change made a  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:21:12):**  very significant policy difference.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:21:14):**  What are your thoughts there about that sort of unpredictability of pricing?  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:21:19):**  There was an article yesterday on ABC news about insurance policy prices in areas just  
**[0:21:25-0:21:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:21:25):**  becoming too much for people.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:21:27):**  What are your thoughts there in terms of parametric and that idea of pricing A being hard to know  
**[0:21:33-0:21:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:21:33):**  upfront and B as whether risk likelihoods increase, surely policy prices have to go  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:21:40):**  up?  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:21:42):**  Insurance can be as cheap or as expensive as you want it to be, especially if parametric  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:21:46):**  because you're coming up with metrics.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:21:49):**  So how much risk do you want to ensure that will reflect the price of the policy?  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:21:55):**  You know, house insurance sense, if you live somewhere where they have recorded a flood  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:00):**  two times in every 10 years, of course your insurance is going to be expensive.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:05):**  If expensive insurance is your main concern, sell and go and live on top of a hill.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:11):**  Your insurance will be cheaper every time.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:13):**  It's the same in parametric insurance.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:15):**  If you want to ensure you're going to get above average rainfall five years out of 10,  
**[0:22:20-0:22:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:20):**  then your insurance will be very expensive.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:22):**  But if you want to ensure decile one and decile 10 or both of them, then it will be cheap  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:27):**  because its incidence is so low.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:29):**  So you can make it whatever you like.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:31):**  And I can say, I want to make sure we're going to have an 800 mil rainfall this year.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:36):**  We're already at 580.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:38):**  So probably not much point me ensuring that because A we're halfway through the year and  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:44):**  we're nearly there, our moisture profile will carry us through anyway.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:49):**  And the chance of us getting 800 mil a year is like two out of 10.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:54):**  It is going to be expensive.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:22:55):**  The way I can see us pricing these policies, and this is after a bit of experience with  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:00):**  them, our main risk is no rain.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:03):**  That's if you look back in history, we are drier than we are wetter.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:06):**  And you can't get too cute with how we work this out because you'll drive yourself insane.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:11):**  You won't be able to find an answer.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:12):**  So we've got to be a little bit broad with that and say, okay, if we don't get 60 mil  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:17):**  of rain every quarter, then every quarter is a payout situation.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:22):**  So we pay a premium every quarter, and that might be a bank guaranteed premium over five  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:27):**  years.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:28):**  And if we get our 60 mil, great, that's fantastic.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:31):**  We're halfway to average every quarter if we get that.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:35):**  If we don't, then we know that there'll be whatever the value of the policy will be,  
**[0:23:41-0:23:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:41):**  $250,000 every quarter coming in.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:43):**  That makes me think you talked about people's, whether it's interest or skill ability, you  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:50):**  also referred to the company that you work with there.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:52):**  They're pretty good at helping out.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:23:54):**  It feels like there is a kind of role there where the digitally native version of an agronomist  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:03):**  should have just as much familiarity with these tools as on the agronomy side because  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:08):**  of those increased production risks that everybody's going to be exposed to.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:13):**  Do you think that's where as this grows, people will source that kind of skill from?  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:18):**  As the appetite grows, there will have to be someone sitting in the middle there, I  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:22):**  suppose.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:23):**  I've asked this of a state agribusiness manager, where do you guys see yourselves fitting into  
**[0:24:29-0:24:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:29):**  this?  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:30):**  We're spending money to ensure that paying back any liabilities to you.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:35):**  We don't have to do that, we have no obligation to do that.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:39):**  His answer was, look, we really don't know anything about this.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:42):**  I said, okay, let's put it in a different term.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:45):**  If we're spending this money to ensure you're getting your money back, can you give us a  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:48):**  cut in your margin?  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:50):**  Because we're being more responsible.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:52):**  He said, we've really got no appetite for that.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:56):**  We already know we can get our money back and you're not a risk to us anyway, so it  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:24:59):**  doesn't really matter.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:00):**  So that is a really poor answer to what's trying to happen here.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:05):**  Would you lend harder if we had a five year policy to ensure that we had X money coming  
**[0:25:11-0:25:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:11):**  in if it didn't rain?  
**[0:25:12-0:25:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:12):**  He said, no, probably not.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:13):**  That's what I wish we'd go and find someone who does align with their values.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:18):**  And another one of the things we imagine with parametric, because it's easy to deliver visually,  
**[0:25:23-0:25:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:23):**  is whether or not the extension of parametric style insurance might shift to somewhere else.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:30):**  In your supply universe, one of the things that seems at least logical would be if you're  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:36):**  forward contracting your grain, the aggregator or whoever you're striking that forward contract  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:42):**  with, they know obviously what grain, what variety, they know where you are, they know  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:46):**  roughly what abiotic stress is at what point in your season will represent a risk to them.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:52):**  Can you see a world potentially where we move to that sort of more embedded style of insurance?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:25:58):**  Like when you check out at an airline booking service and it says, do you want travel insurance  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:03):**  with that kind of thing?  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:04):**  Yes.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:05):**  So that's already happening, but I suppose to put it in broad terms, like that grain  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:10):**  Corp say in the drought a couple of years ago, they had a parametric product where if  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:15):**  East Coast grain production dropped below X hundreds of thousands of tonnes, I can't  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:20):**  remember exactly what the parameter was, then they received a payout.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:25):**  And I think it was somewhere in excess of $80 million.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:28):**  Yes, I do remember that one.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:31):**  Yep.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:33):**  And that was otherwise had a pretty bad time leading up to that, I think.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:36):**  And then that was a significant payday.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:38):**  That was a pretty crafty insurance policy.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:40):**  So they're doing that on their scale in terms that they don't need to come down to individual  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:46):**  scale.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:47):**  There's a lot of admin involved in trying to do that.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:50):**  So I can't see how that, I suppose it could work.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:56):**  You can never say, can't see how it would work.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:26:58):**  We can't see how it would work now, but there'd be a solution to it for sure.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:03):**  That's one thing that we often wonder about too, which is that sometimes after people  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:09):**  like yourself start using this product, you actually end up using it in a different way  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:14):**  than what you thought you were going to do with it when you started, because these products  
**[0:27:18-0:27:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:18):**  often by their nature are actually more adaptable.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:21):**  And then at some point you'll go, Oh, wait on, I could do X and Y.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:27):**  Have you had any experiences like that, where you've found that that kind of additional  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:33):**  level of flexibility suited a scenario that you wasn't necessarily one of the ones you  
**[0:27:38-0:27:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:38):**  were thinking about from the outset?  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:40):**  Hail, traditional hail and we all know traditional hail and fire insurance.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:44):**  We had a conversation about hail and it's already happening parametrically.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:49):**  So it's very hard to independently measure hail size and intensity that's done after  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:54):**  the fact with traditional hail and fire.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:27:57):**  Someone says it comes out, has a look generally trying to take them to the worst part of the  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:00):**  paddock.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:01):**  So you don't get excessed out of your pay app, but with the parametric insurance growing  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:06):**  they are trialing hail sensing pads in orchards in the States.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:12):**  And that's measuring intensity and size of hail.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:17):**  So we are hopefully going to be trialing that this year on one paddock.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:22):**  We're just working out what it'll cost traditionally compared to what it'll cost with these sensing  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:27):**  pads.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:28):**  And yeah, we'll do a trial on it this year.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:30):**  I never ever thought that would be a possibility because how do you measure hail size intensity  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:36):**  rather than standing out in it or seeing that your crops wiped out the next day.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:41):**  And that was another thing that seemed pretty fundamental in terms of just the economics  
**[0:28:45-0:28:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:45):**  of how parametric insurance could eventually work that you don't need an assessor to go  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:52):**  out there, right?  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:53):**  You don't need someone to come and estimate the actual loss that occurred.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:57):**  It's simply the event did or did not occur.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:28:59):**  And you have previously agreed that what you'll get paid when that event happens.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:04):**  And it'll be a whole lot cheaper to do that at large scale if lots of people want to jump  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:08):**  on board.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:09):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:10):**  We're not waiting around for an assessor or with the multi peril running a header through  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:15):**  a paddock to get yield data to say that you didn't have enough there to bother harvesting  
**[0:29:19-0:29:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:19):**  it.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:20):**  Like that's antiquated, isn't it?  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:22):**  So yeah, it is adaptable to big scale.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:25):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:26):**  Because you don't need that manpower where the data comes in.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:28):**  If everyone can trust the data and there's a platform for trusting the data, then there's  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:32):**  no reason it can't be scaled very quickly.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:35):**  A kind of final question, you briefly touched on what the future of parametric might look  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:41):**  like.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:42):**  You've obviously had more experience with it the most and you've referred to needing  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:46):**  kind of strong service providers who can help.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:49):**  Looking a little further ahead, do you have a vision for what the future of parametric  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:54):**  can be?  
**[0:29:55-0:29:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:55):**  Are you touched on the hail thing?  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:29:56):**  Is there stuff that's further out on the horizon that you're pretty keen to see?  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:00):**  I hope I don't know the answer to that question.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:03):**  I'm glad I don't because there's someone smarter than me thinking about it somewhere, hopefully.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:08):**  The options are endless.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:09):**  If you can find a way to measure it independently and the reinsurer is happy with it, that's  
**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:15):**  the only limits.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:18):**  One of the things that we've also thought a bit about there is almost like the emergence  
**[0:30:22-0:30:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:22):**  of kind of really specialised reinsurers.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:25):**  The more data you can get access to, the more likely it seems that you can build pretty  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:30):**  specific models that aren't just generally about weather but specifically might be kilos  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:36):**  of weight gain in a particular breed of cattle on a grassland system.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:41):**  Do you see it going that far potentially?  
**[0:30:44-0:30:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:44):**  I don't think it can go that far.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:47):**  Again, not being negative, I hope it could get to that but just from what I know of how  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:52):**  the reinsurers like their data, that's not going to be measured and it's not going to  
**[0:30:57-0:31:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:30:57):**  be specific and independently measured unless it's a walkover weighing system or something  
**[0:31:04-0:31:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:04):**  like that.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:05):**  I think probably where it's going to stay until there's enough uptake in that situation  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:10):**  is, well, that producer knows what he can do if he's got grass.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:14):**  As far as weight gain goes, grass production is driven by rain and sunlight so if we don't  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:20):**  have rain, we don't get grass, we don't get weight gain.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:22):**  So I think if you're measuring that weight gain to that point, you'll be able to work  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:26):**  it backwards and go, the rain is the easiest one at the moment.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:29):**  If they want to come to the party and do walkover weighing some sort of an algorithm to work  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:34):**  that into a policy, I'd love to see that.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:36):**  That'd be great.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:38):**  This conversation was so absolutely jam-packed with insight, it was honestly hard to choose  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:43):**  but a couple of things that Tom mentioned have really stuck with us.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:46):**  First, I really like the distinction Tom made between his land business and his production  
**[0:31:50-0:31:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:50):**  business and the trap that it's easy to fall into of subsidizing an unnecessarily high-risk  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:31:56):**  production operation with the margins and equity of a land business.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:00):**  It seems that this conscious division of the businesses helped Tom understand the need  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:04):**  and the opportunity in limiting his risk on the farming side, which is helping him make  
**[0:32:09-0:32:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:09):**  both sides of his business be more successful.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:12):**  Then I loved the idea that the greatest risks to Tom's farm are weather and emotion, especially  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:17):**  because those two things are so often caught up together.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:21):**  Tom has been able to use parametric insurance products to mitigate his risk on both fronts,  
**[0:32:25-0:32:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:25):**  but it's taken a lot of effort and learning.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:28):**  Which brings me to a final takeaway about how important the data, the knowledge, and  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:32):**  the deep understanding of his business have been in Tom's journey into the parametric  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:36):**  insurance world.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:38):**  Despite the significant upside that's possible with these products, I think it's clear that  
**[0:32:42-0:32:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:42):**  they are not for the casual dabbler.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:44):**  In my mind, two pressures are going to alter that over time.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:47):**  On the one hand, I think economic and financial pressure will continue to favor farmers like  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:51):**  Tom and disempower others who don't want to make the investments in data and know-how.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:32:57):**  On the other hand, I also think the current wave of ag tech we're in will require, and  
**[0:33:01-0:33:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:33:01):**  maybe even bring with it, a serious upskilling for farmers and their teams of staff and advisors.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/changing-the-risk-profile-of-agriculture-a-farmers-perspective-on-parametric-insurance#t=0:33:07):**  So that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.

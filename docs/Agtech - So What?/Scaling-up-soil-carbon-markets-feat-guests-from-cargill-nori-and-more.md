### Agtech - So What?  (2020-12-02)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to Ag Tech So What, brought to you by the Ag Then Day Group.  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  Carbon is one of the most exciting and yet most complex topics in ag tech at the moment.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:00:14):**  Carbon markets, where farmers on one side can sell credits that represent the carbon  they sequester in soil through management practices, to buyers on the other side that  range from governments to large private emitters to individuals, are a hot topic.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:00:30):**  Public and private market administrators around the world are being criticized for running  inefficient carbon markets with too many costs that make it sub-economic for farmers to participate.  Meanwhile, the race is on, as a number of private sector players, in some cases backed  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:00:44):**  by serious money, are developing technologies and new business models to make it simpler  and more worthwhile for farmers to get rewarded for storing carbon in soil.  Recently, we teamed up with the Australian AgriTech Association, SproutX and Plat Farm  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:01:00):**  to get a group of soil carbon experts together for a panel discussion on what it will take  to scale up soil carbon markets.  I think what we're starting to see now is a broader recognition that environmental markets  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:01:12):**  and agriculture are one and the same thing.  They're not mutually exclusive elements on a different track.  So the question I'm asking is why are we spending tons and tons and tons and tons of taxpayer  
**[0:01:23-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:01:23):**  resources to build a methodology that costs $15 to $50 a ton to maintain when there's  an option available to us that's going to cost a buck.  You just heard from Alden Donnelly, co-founder of Nori, a carbon marketplace startup based  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:01:39):**  in Seattle, Washington.  And before that was Dave Moore from Green Collar, an Australian carbon project developer  that helps landholders access the government's carbon market.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:01:49):**  They're both passionate about rewarding farmers for the environmental benefits they provide,  but have different views about how to scale up the markets that do this in the long run.  You also hear from Sam Duncan, founder of FarmLab, an Australian ag tech startup that  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:02:03):**  helps farmers keep track of their soil carbon levels.  There almost needs to be a cheaper, no cost mechanism to reward people that are already  doing the right thing because there's also a lot of information we can draw from what  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:02:15):**  they're doing to bring back into the mainstream carbon markets.  And to round out the discussion, we've gone to the big end of town to learn how multinational  agribusinesses are bridging the gap between consumers' demand for carbon neutral food  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:02:28):**  and fiber and the realities of complex natural systems and supply chains.  This is Matt Schmidt from Cargill.  Carbon is the lingua franca of sustainability.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:02:40):**  It comes up in so many areas and touches on so many elements.  And that's often what we find ourselves being asked about externally.  But when talking with farmers, it's as much farmer resilience as it is anything.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:02:55):**  We start out the discussion jumping into a big question on everyone's mind.  How do we lower the costs for producers to participate while still ensuring the credits  are legit?  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:03:05):**  Alden from Nori shares her views first.  She's a true pioneer in the industry.  In fact, she was the first person acting for a buyer's group ever to sign a contract to  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:03:14):**  buy carbon credits from farmers back in the 1990s.  In doing this, Alden learned a lot about market inefficiencies and costs and what governments  and the private sector can do to overcome these challenges.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:03:27):**  And at the time, we originally went to the science community and said, what do farmers  have to do to provide us credible credits demonstrating soil organic carbon stock change  in the world's leading soil scientists, including Rattan, Lal, Cezar, Zerald, and Keith Postion,  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:03:43):**  put a lot of work into it and proved to us that it was going to cost farmers $80 a ton  or credit if we think one ton per acre per year on average to quantify and verify their  otherwise valid claims.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:03:56):**  So we financed an exercise of getting the scientists together to come up with a better  plan.  And the plan they came up with after four years of research, which we funded, was the  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:04:08):**  following proposal.  Collaborate government and the private sector to set up what we call a network of soil sample  reference or experimental sites.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:04:18):**  So step back and look at your soil maps, your land use mixes, precipitation zones, and say  what's the smallest number of sites that you want to do very, very, very, very comprehensive  and expensive soil sampling and testing on a predictable and good cycle.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:04:37):**  So that the data that is coming out of those sites informs a model and enables you to extrapolate  the information you get out of that reference network to the extent that you can really  be producing with the related model.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:04:52):**  Estimates of soil organic carbon stock change in response to different land use changes.  With uncertainties, uncertainties of plus or minus 25% to 40% are acceptable.  We can make a market work with uncertainties that large if we know the uncertainties.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:05:07):**  It's not knowing the uncertainties that shuts us down.  We do believe that if you set up such a network and then you are filling in data gaps with  the data that's being reported by the market project participants over time, it doesn't  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:05:20):**  take more than 10 years to get the uncertainties that measure plus model strategy to just as  you down to 12% to 20%.  In fact, the way that is being prescribed by new protocols in the United States and  
**[0:05:33-0:05:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:05:33):**  in Australia, you're still getting estimates that have plus or minus 20 to 40% uncertainties.  You're just paying somewhere between 15 and 50.  The first 15 to $50 a ton that you get paid for your credits or your aggregator gets paid  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:05:49):**  is just paying for those exercises of quantification and verification.  Alden's original work was in Canada, but she's now seeing this approach work in the US where  Nori is using Comet Farm, a US Department of Agriculture endorsed methodology based  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:06:04):**  on the same principles.  And Alden believes it has potential for other voluntary and compliance markets, including  in Australia, if implemented correctly.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:06:13):**  I'll give you some numbers.  I want to challenge you with my last slide.  In the United States, if we set up a network of 6,000 experimental test sites to inform  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:06:25):**  a model like Comet Farm, which right now only has 1,200 experimental test sites, and we  found ourselves with a carbon market where the annual turnover was 20 million credits,  they're NRTs in Nori language, then the cost of maintaining the infrastructure that is  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:06:43):**  giving us what we consider reliable enough estimates actually runs down to about $0.69  a ton.  So the question I'm asking is, why are we spending tons and tons and tons and tons of  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:06:54):**  taxpayer resources to build a methodology that costs $15 to $50 a ton to maintain when  there's an option available to us that's going to cost a buck?  I also am adamant in my assertions that all of us in the marketplace should be encouraging  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:07:10):**  our governments to put their seed funding into establishing that infrastructure so that  it's up and that the private sector can take on the cost of carrying it when the government  funding dries up, because we got the prescription right in Canada in the 1990s, and the US Comet  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:07:26):**  Farm team got the prescription right in 2002.  And in every case, sorry about my doggy, in every case, even though the business plan  was right, government cut the funding before it was executed completely.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:07:40):**  And let's just assume government funding is going to dry up before it's executed completely.  Let's not get the government funding very expensive site-specific soil sampling and  testing because when the government funding dries up, we haven't created the infrastructure  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:07:57):**  that is efficient enough for the private sector to take it over and keep it rolling.  Alden has looked a bit at the Australian context and has a challenge to put to us.  I want to challenge Australia.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:08:09):**  I love that there's 2000 sites where soil samples have been taken to date.  And what I see of the 2500 sites that Australia has already got sampling data, 1% to 2% of  the total sites overlap the regions that have the greatest potential and the greatest population  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:08:31):**  of projects.  So I think if you step back and did a very sort of intentional statistical analysis saying,  how do we set up the representative reference of sites, you'll need way less soil sampling  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:08:46):**  and testing sites than you are maintaining already.  Sam from FarmLab is operating in the Australian market, helping farmers and agronomists view  and manage their soil.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:08:57):**  We provide sort of the architecture that Alden was talking about.  What we do is we work with the soil testing labs to integrate the data into the cloud  system, so that for a farmer, they can see all their soil test results across their farm.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:09:11):**  Normally, it's done through agribusinesses and advisors.  We work through them.  What we're looking at specifically in terms of carbon are helping to build these hybrid  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:09:21):**  models to lower the cost of soil carbon measurement in particular.  But we really believe that it goes hand in hand with a lot of the standard sort of agronomy  that takes place across a farm because you don't just set out to farm carbon.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:09:36):**  Most of the time, you also farm something else like cattle or crops.  So these two things really need to go hand in hand.  When it comes to managing the soil, we need to be realistic here.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:09:46):**  We're not just managing carbon across the landscape.  We're also managing fertility and other bits and pieces.  Fortunately for us, and the science is pretty clear on this, is they go hand in hand.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:09:55):**  Sam is intimately familiar with the significant risks, costs and challenges that farmers are  facing in participating in the government's soil carbon market here in Australia.  The last I saw, which is probably a few months old now, but there are only 68 soil carbon  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:09):**  projects across Australia accumulating carbon credits.  Now that's soil carbon, not carbon credits generated through other things.  But it's not a whole lot, particularly given the Australian methodology has been in existence  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:20):**  since 2012.  Why is that the case?  It's really important that we look at some of the real behavioural challenges around  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:28):**  sequestering soil carbon and entering into these projects.  Now there's two things I've flagged here.  First is that soil carbon projects are relatively expensive, which Oleson has gone through in  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:37):**  a lot of detail.  I think he said $80 a hectare to improve soil carbon.  We estimate the projects we see are about, it costs about $50,000 to undertake baselining  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:46):**  as part of those soil carbon projects.  So it's not cheap.  And then the risk reward itself is also not proven.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:52):**  We have had some soil carbon credits be issued.  Some of the first carbon credits were issued probably 6-12 months ago now, I think through  projects down in Victoria, which was absolutely fantastic.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:02):**  So that's starting to change.  We're starting to see, I guess, our heroes in this space, the producers that are actually  able to go out and say this worked for me, which is a real fundamental barrier to overcome  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:13):**  in terms of the adoption of these projects, but they're still super expensive.  And the reason for that is because the Australian method for measurement is very conservative.  You know, for producers, it's like, I know as a small business owner, if I came to you  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:26):**  and I said, hey, look, if you pay me $80,000, I might give you a million dollars 10-15 years  down the track, right?  Now that's really good, but are you going to, for a small business owner, are you going  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:37):**  to be around 10-15 years down the track?  What do you have to do to get that?  And there's all these regulatory things in place that are really restrictive.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:44):**  So putting this back into the farmer's perspective, for the farmer to enter into these 15-20-25  projects, there's a lot of risk there, which can be really, really off-putting.  Alden says it's not just Australia's government regulated market that's plagued with inefficiencies.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:12:00):**  Existing carbon markets, including the leading ones, including when you look at the newest  approaches people have, are promoting, still have a three to five year lag between when  you pay to register your project and what you get your first credit issuance and a one  
**[0:12:16-0:12:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:12:16):**  to two year lag before your first credit sales.  And to date worldwide, if you look at all of the carbon registries, including Gold Standard,  Vera, and Carr, just 36-48% of all the credits that have ever been issued for sale have not  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:12:30):**  been retired or bought.  So it's not exactly what you call a success story.  Another challenge is that all too often, the discussion on carbon markets misses the fact  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:12:40):**  that farmers are already sequestering carbon in soil without an extra incentive, just because  it's good business.  Here's Sam again.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:12:48):**  There are a large portion of farmers that are already doing this without the monetary  reward.  And I'm talking about the Regent Ag farmers, the ones that have seen the benefits, the  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:12:58):**  environmental benefit of improving soil carbon.  And that's great, but how do we reward them for what they've already been doing?  And so there almost needs to be a cheaper, no cost mechanism to reward people that are  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:13:10):**  already doing the right thing, because there's also a lot of information we can draw from  what they're doing to bring back into the mainstream carbon markets.  Given the complexities of these markets, there are intermediaries, called project developers,  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:13:23):**  popping up to help landowners register for and get carbon credits.  David Moore is the COO of one of these, called Greencaller.  Greencaller does do more than just carbon projects, but they are Australia's largest  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:13:35):**  participant in the federal government scheme, having secured contracts to supply about 65  million carbon credit units, or tons of abatement.  They also just received an investment from private equity firm KKR through its billion  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:13:48):**  dollar Global Impact Fund.  Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.  So we partnered with landholders, land managers, we worked with government agencies, corporate  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:13:59):**  agricultural companies, mining companies, to develop environmental markets projects.  We're a specialist in environmental accounts.  We do the end-to-end life cycle management of those projects, but we're predominantly  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:14:11):**  a supply-based organization.  So we're looking to supply carbon credits and other offsets for corporate buyers, government  buyers, to meet either their ESG obligations, sustainable development ambitions, or compliance  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:14:25):**  obligations that they may have under different legislative arrangements.  Dave argues that to capitalize on this opportunity at scale, we need a mindset shift from just  measuring the value of generating and selling carbon credits to a more whole-of-farm approach  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:14:40):**  that factors in other environmental and productivity benefits, and in doing so, creates more benefits  for farmers.  What we're starting to see now is a broader recognition that environmental markets and  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:14:51):**  agriculture are one and the same thing.  They're not mutually exclusive elements on a different track.  What we're about is saying to a landholder, what can we do to extract the most value out  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:15:02):**  of the land use decisions you're looking to undertake?  So for example, we looked in Queensland quite a few years ago around how do we try and use  carbon markets in high-value landscapes, high-value production landscapes?  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:15:15):**  And what we realized quite quickly is carbon alone, as the only measurement of an ecosystem  service in the Australian context, was not enough to incentivize land use changes that  needed to happen to have consequential benefits around things like water quality and improved  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:15:30):**  ground cover and avoiding erosion and things like that.  So what we had to do was go, well, we're only pricing half the environmental benefit.  We actually need to start pricing the other ecosystem services that come as a consequence  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:15:43):**  of those land use decisions.  So we actually spent the last four years designing and developing a whole new environmental market  around water quality that's dedicated to the Great Barrier Reef catchments that will actually  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:15:56):**  pay landholders for management changes that they undertake on the ground that improve  water quality.  And what you can do is you can stack that with the carbon benefit and that starts to  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:16:06):**  actually go up the cost curve to incentivize landholders to want to make those required  decisions.  But for farmers, as Sam said earlier, the journey often doesn't start with carbon credits.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:16:16):**  And further, credits alone for sure won't be the only incentive scheme available to  farmers.  Here's Sam again.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:16:23):**  That's a really good point there.  And I don't want to ignore one of the other major incentives here, Dave.  I know today is focusing on carbon markets, but there is massive incentive in terms of  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:16:33):**  consumer driven carbon neutrality.  And that's something that maybe we're ignoring a little bit is that consumers, I mean, we're  all consumers anyway, we all eat soup.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:16:42):**  But how often do we look at how that beef or how that box of corn flakes was produced  in terms of sustainability and carbon neutrality or carbon positive if you were requesting  carbon negative, positive if you were requesting more carbon into the ground than you are emitting.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:16:58):**  And this is actually, I think, a really fundamental thing, right?  Because let's look at the market in terms of producers, 110,000 producers across Australia.  How many of those are realistically going to enter into carbon projects, right?  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:17:08):**  And this is a broad spectrum from high end to hobby farmers.  Now we need another incentive outside of just carbon credits because, you know, I answered  a question just before from a flower grower, which is actually, you know, you've got three  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:17:26):**  hectares worth of land, it's never going to be under the current schemes profitable to  enter into a carbon credit project to improve carbon over three hectares.  You know, we're talking, we see projects here in New England of minimum 200, 250 hectares,  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:17:40):**  at least given the risk, given the climate, climate thick conditions, and given what you  need to do, given the small increase of carbon we normally get up here in New England anyway.  So you need this other incentive.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:17:50):**  We need the government looking at this other incentive.  We need consumers pulling stuff off the shelves because it's carbon neutral or carbon positive.  And I think that's a huge challenge there because that all comes back to provenance  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:18:03):**  and knowing where the stuff is actually coming from.  This point is absolutely critical in our view, at least.  Soil carbon projects won't suit all farmers, but there are other ways for farmers to get  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:18:13):**  rewarded for the environmental benefits they produce, including through pull from the consumer  end of the value chain.  That's why we also brought Matt Schmidt, Senior Director of Commercial Carbon at Cargill onto  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:18:25):**  the panel to talk about the range of new opportunities, many of them digital, that exist for farmers.  Just a little bit about Cargill.  If you haven't heard of us before, we are an invisible giant in Pudanag.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:18:38):**  We are about 155 years old.  We do business in something like 125 countries with 160,000 employees around the world.  And depending on how you measure it, we impact about a quarter of the world's food supply  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:18:52):**  throughout the year in lots of different ways.  One area that I will call out here that we do not do is we are not in the business of  manufacturing traditional ag inputs.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:19:01):**  So no seeds, no fertilizers, nothing like that.  Farmers choose to do business with us every day.  We are the revenue side of a farming business, and we see a lot of opportunities to take  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:19:13):**  some of those same frameworks and apply them to opportunities for farmers to engage in  new, let's call them digital crops, be they carbon credits, other ecosystem services,  water credits, et cetera.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:19:27):**  We recognize that there is a richness to farmers everywhere.  Every farm is different.  Every year is different for every farmer.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:19:35):**  And just like we bring market opportunities to farmers for grain, so we want to respect  that richness and that diversity in bringing future opportunities to farmers in new areas.  And really at the center of all this, we see the farmer as critical.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:19:52):**  This is an entity at the core who has not just Cargill, but their financing and their  equipment and their labor and their culture and their community and their knowledge and  their expertise.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:20:04):**  And for deep systemic change to happen, we feel more than just point solutions are needed.  So carbon is the lingua franca of sustainability.  It comes up in so many areas and touches on so many elements.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:20:19):**  And that's often what we find ourselves being asked about externally.  But when talking with farmers, it's as much farmer resilience as it is anything.  How do we ensure that farming operations have a chance to continue in the future as they  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:20:36):**  might face increasingly extreme weather events and increasingly extreme market conditions?  We need to have resilience built into systems to offer that.  So we have done a lot of work looking at different soil health programs and opportunities and  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:20:54):**  a couple of kind of consensus points there.  One is that nailing down any particular outcome to any particular practice on any particular  field is really difficult.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:21:04):**  But two, the more farmer engages, the more practices that they might choose to stack  on top of one another, or the more they lean into the opportunity, the more powerful the  outcomes we see.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:21:15):**  So hard to measure and yet sometimes easy to see.  And it really just comes down to let's help farmers be successful because when farmers  succeed, the rest of us are successful too.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:21:28):**  While the focus for Cargill is very much on the farmer, does consumer demand and changing  preferences for sustainable food play a role?  Yeah, it's tricky.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:21:41):**  There's a lot of debate about where is the consumer preference, where is it driving,  where is it headed.  I think that we have seen a lot of shifts that track with changing demographics.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:21:54):**  And so there are certainly shifts that are predictable.  But some of the sort of equally powerful demographic shifts are that rising GDP leads to rising  protein demand in countries everywhere.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:22:07):**  And so I think that it's important to bring in that language for consumers and give people  a way to navigate it.  I look at the relative success of calorie labeling in the US and love it or hate it.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:22:23):**  What has been produced is a number that goes on food that people more or less account with  good and bad.  And I think that there is something like that that can be paralysed here perhaps.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:22:34):**  And you see certain brands are leaning into that in the US right now.  It's clear that governments, food and agribusinesses, tech developers and even farmers all have  a role to play in scaling up carbon markets.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:22:47):**  But how exactly this happens is still up for debate, of course.  Let's jump back to the panel discussion.  Talking about incentives here and I think the point around for a farmer, do I participate  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:22:57):**  in a carbon market?  Do I participate in something in my supply chain?  Do I do a course to improve management practices?  
**[0:23:02-0:23:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:23:02):**  Should my agronomist help me?  Who do I sell to?  Like it is really confusing, increasingly so.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:23:08):**  I wanted to go back to the cost to participate point, though, that's been made a couple of  times.  There's new technologies to onboard farmers into these markets.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:23:17):**  But could you talk a little bit just about the challenge of cost to participate and how  you see that changing in the future?  It really depends on how you go about it.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:23:27):**  Between 2005 and 2015, worldwide, crop and livestock producers sold just under 14 million  carbon credits over all markets, 13.7 of which were sold in one market, the Alberta, Canada  large emitters market, where the prices buyers paid ranged from $12 Canadian through $30  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:23:51):**  Canadian.  But on average, the actual crop producers net out of that marketplace was running about  $50 to $3 per acre.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:24:04):**  The government went to fix that and in their fix, with all the best intentions, create  a market that became not viable at all.  So it died.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:24:13):**  In our marketplace right now, and I got to say our numbers are really anecdotal because  our volumes are small and we can't make any guarantees.  But for NRTs right now in our marketplace in the US, buyers have paid on average US  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:24:28):**  $17.25 a ton, $17.25 a ton.  And our costs cover the cost of quantification, are running $2.25 a ton.  The average project is generating one ton per acre per year, ranging from 0.7 to 1.1.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:24:47):**  And verification costs are running between $0.25 and $0.50 a ton.  And in our marketplace, our verifier is the world's leading verifier in the traditional  markets.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:24:58):**  We are not compromising quality.  And the difference is how we do it.  Do you want to talk a little bit more about that?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:25:04):**  I imagine the next question will be like, what do you mean?  All those numbers mean so far we're delivering the farmer on average, say $12 to $13 an acre,  which is a good return.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:25:17):**  Average US crop producer through $27 to $40 an acre to the bottom line over the last five  seasons.  So if you add $13 to that, it's a pretty good deal.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:25:27):**  It's not a good deal for really small operators.  So to make the market work, they've got to work with aggregators and data managers.  In our marketplace, quantification and verification costs are much lower than traditional markets  
**[0:25:41-0:25:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:25:41):**  because we are using the reference network model informed estimation method, which means  you don't have to hire a consultant and pay them $50,000 to interpret the 145-page protocol.  And in verification, our verification costs are running about 10% of the norm in traditional  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:26:01):**  places because we are using open source, continuously peer reviewed and upgraded quantification  model Comet Farm.  So we don't ask the verifiers to verify the quantification method.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:26:15):**  Our quantification method is a method that informs the US national inventory.  So all the verifiers are quantifying is that the people who claim they own the project  actually do or have been assigned authority to control the project by the owners of the  
**[0:26:30-0:26:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:26:30):**  land, and that the operating data they've supplied us is reasonable and replicable.  So when you go from very complex protocols that have three or four different approaches  available to you to figure out how to set your baseline and estimate your incremental  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:26:50):**  solar organic carbon stock change and shift to an open source, continuously reviewed,  as parents informed model, then a whole bunch of verification and quantification costs are  reduced.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:02):**  I'm curious, Dave, that's a little bit different than how you guys work.  Do you want to kind of explain how what you guys do fits in?  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:10):**  I mean, there's a whole range of different ways that you can account for carbon.  And we work very much under the compliance market in an Australian context.  So I guess in more of the traditional type carbon markets where I guess offsets integrity  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:24):**  standards, so legislative standards around sort of transparency and measurement.  And it's very much a regulated framework that we work under.  So we apply methodologies that are all peer reviewed, and then we apply them working with  
**[0:27:37-0:27:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:37):**  landholders in particular properties.  We create Australian carbon credits units that are all independently audited.  And then we generally sell those units either to the government as a buyer, and they report  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:48):**  on them for the United Nations targets, or as Sam mentioned, what we're starting to see  a lot more of in the last 6-12 months is corporate organisations globally starting to take a  very strong interest in net zero emissions targets or sustainable development goal targets.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:04):**  And so we're starting to see significant buying in that part of the market for voluntary reasons.  But the key bit that buyers are looking to see is the integrity of the offset.  And what are the co-benefits?  
**[0:28:16-0:28:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:16):**  There's this term co-benefits that everyone talks about.  And it's critically important to be able to explicitly measure and verify and demonstrate  what the impact of that carbon project has been in relation to social and community benefits,  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:31):**  if it's working with traditional owner communities, biodiversity benefits, water quality benefits.  It's not enough to say, oh, these are these sort of amorphous nice benefits that come  from our carbon project.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:43):**  You need to measure and verify how those co-benefits are being generated.  And that will increase the value of the offset.  Sam, do you want to just close the loop kind of on how FarmLab fits into this?  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:53):**  So we see the journey of the farmer in terms of their soil management journey starting  before they even start to think about carbon, right?  So a lot of our users come to us before they enter into a carbon project, the consultants  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:04):**  start using the software, they'll upload a bunch of historic results, because they've  already been playing with soil carbon and trying to improve it and trying to improve  it in line with yields and reduction of inputs, right?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:14):**  And then, you know, what was found is that they'll seek out somebody like Green Collar  to embark on a, you know, formally registered project, Green Collar will then go and provide  all the information around the different markets out there, the different ways you can improve  
**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:28):**  carbon.  And then we just sit there and we kind of act as a communication tool between somebody  like Green Collar, the consultants and the farmer.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:34):**  So the farmer can actually see what's changing and get the visual picture rather than just  hearing about carbon credits.  And, you know, because there's a lot of complex, especially when you start to actually dive  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:43):**  into the calculations, you know, there's a lot of complex calculations that go into determining  how much carbon has been improved per hectare based on a single soil sample, right?  So it's very statistical.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:55):**  So we try and take a lot of that statistical maths out of it by just showing a picture  and showing the changes of carbon over time and giving the, you know, improving that communication.  So there was a few points raised there, but I wanted to go to Matt actually, and there's  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:09):**  a question in the audience that relates to this, like if KPMG or Qantas are paying $40,  there's different ways for corporates to participate in this space and Cargill is a corporate with  farmers in their supply chain.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:21):**  How are you guys thinking about kind of voluntary versus compliance markets and how to kind  of play in the space?  Sure.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:29):**  So I mentioned earlier that I think framing carbon as a crop for a farmer is an important  place to start, especially when you consider that, you know, on a farm by farm basis, it's  likely that carbon as a source of revenue will never be the major source of revenue.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:44):**  It's going to be something that they can, that an individual producer can produce and  it requires, you know, inputs and expertise and, you know, you worry about yield and pricing  and so on.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:54):**  But all of these carbon products are fundamentally data products at their core.  And so whether the data that you use to create the credit and you call a credit a representation  of data, according to some protocol, whether you take that credit into a voluntary market  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:12):**  or a compliance market or an insetting market or some other scheme, you know, I would love  to get to a point where there is flexibility and we can bring different market options  to farmers, you know, where maybe the rigor of measurement and verification from one program  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:26):**  is different than what a farmer might align with for, you know, what they're ready to  do.  And so that's fine because there's another program that's ready in there.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:34):**  In general, we like to say that the quality of data is only something that can be measured  against fitness for commercial purpose.  And we see a lot of black and white data quality discussions out there around soil carbon that  
**[0:31:49-0:31:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:49):**  I think misses the potential just richness of commercial purposes out there.  So KPMG at $40 a ton, great.  You know, the government at a lower price per ton, you know, maybe that's fine for farmers  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:32:03):**  to pursue and different markets are fine because they can value that data to different degrees,  much like different markets value different crops or different quality to different degrees  today.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:32:17):**  I just wanted to make a controversial remark.  We are focused on voluntary market.  We think this is an important opportunity for food and fiber producers to get new revenues  
**[0:32:26-0:32:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:32:26):**  from outside the food supply chain.  And we think that's really important because I don't know of any culture in the world where  food and fiber consumers actually pay prices sufficient to cover the full cost of producing  
**[0:32:37-0:32:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:32:37):**  what they eat and where.  So this is a one time in history opportunity to diversify revenues in a way that could  change everything for the food and fiber industry.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:32:52):**  That's the first thing.  The second thing is we are very focused on our market being a voluntary market, but we're  hoping to inform how compliance markets work.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:33:01):**  And the things that you have to be really, really careful about and pay attention to,  and here's the controversial thing, is traditional cap and trade as we know it cannot possibly  scale up for this purpose.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:33:13):**  I'm saying that as someone who was convinced for 20 years that we could scale it up.  The reality is that in every existing cap and trade type compliance market that's been  built by any government to date, every allowance or credit is counted at least twice.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:33:33):**  And in the California compliance market, 68% of the credits are counted or credited three  times.  So the dilemma we face is in California, buyers and compliance operators think they're paying  
**[0:33:47-0:33:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:33:47):**  $15, say $20 per ton CO2 equivalent, but they're paying $20 per certificate, the underlying  value of which is no more than a third of a ton.  So the actual market price being paid in California right now is 60 bucks a ton, but nobody knows  
**[0:34:05-0:34:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:34:05):**  it.  Drives me crazy.  One of the things we're trying to do is create a market that shows how you can get true price  
**[0:34:14-0:34:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:34:14):**  discovery and actual credit tracing so you can see that it isn't double counted in our  marketplace.  One of the topics that's not talked about much is the issue of permanence.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:34:26):**  And it seems like with soil carbon market participation, it can create challenges that  will make it more complex for farmers to decide between alternatives.  You know, thinking about covenants over land and data access rights.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:34:36):**  Do you have any comments?  And Dave, maybe we'll start with you on challenges and opportunities here.  That's a really good point.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:34:44):**  And that, and particularly sort of speaking in the traditional market that we have in  Australia when you're looking at soil carbon.  So as a commercial developer, looking at how you can scale up carbon, when you look at  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:34:55):**  the soil carbon method in particular, and I guess the complexity around testing, operational  costs to actually validate the sequestration that's occurring in the soil, and you're playing  that against the risks around permanence and the requirement legally to need to have some  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:35:13):**  level of, I guess, security in relation to the asset to make sure that that carbon is  being sequestered for a period of time.  It does, that's where it starts to get a bit tricky because you're selling a financial  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:35:24):**  instrument.  That's what you're selling.  It's personal property.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:35:27):**  It's like a share, right?  And so you need to be able to demonstrate quite clearly that there's permanence, that  there's integrity, and that if you're a developer taking on that risk, given the cost of development  
**[0:35:40-0:35:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:35:40):**  at scale, you need to have some level of understanding that that is going to be there over time,  right, to manage that risk.  And so I don't have a specific answer for that at the moment, other than to say it's  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:35:53):**  a challenge that is currently being worked through and it has been a pressure point in  terms of scaling up soil carbon at the moment.  Alden, do you want to quickly comment on that?  
**[0:36:02-0:36:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:36:02):**  I saw you nodding.  Dave's exactly right.  We work very closely to get guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:36:09):**  and Commodity Futures Trading Commission to the best of our ability, make sure that we're  in compliance with their rules.  I do want to say that we do need to help our governments figure out how to be part of the  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:36:22):**  process of building a market where apples are traded for apples and not necessarily  plums.  And I'll give you an example.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:36:31):**  In most compliance markets, a whole bunch of emitters are allocated freely greenhouse  gas allowances if their emission intensity is below an industry standard benchmark.  So farmers who are being required to comply with a permanence test are competing in a  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:36:52):**  market against free allowances that were issued to large emitters who haven't had to even  reduce emissions to have that marketable allowance.  I'm not saying that way of trading emission entitlements is wrong.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:37:07):**  I'm saying it's not an apple.  It's a plum.  And any kind of carbon drawdown and retention that meets even short-term retention tests  
**[0:37:18-0:37:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:37:18):**  is a more valuable commodity.  We have to figure out how to make that evident and their exchange rates emerge in our market  places.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:37:27):**  So there's a lot still to be done to scale up carbon markets.  But for sure, in doing so, we have to remain farmer-centric to develop viable incentives  where the cost of participating matches the rewards.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:37:40):**  While the markets and tech are still evolving, Sam argues that farmers need to be given access  to accurate and simplified information about soil carbon so they can start to make decisions  today.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:37:51):**  Now, taking out the carbon credit market thing, you can start thinking about carbon long before  you enter into a carbon project because there are so many unknowns for a producer.  Well, climate, which is always unknown, but you'll have a general understanding of your  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:38:05):**  climate, although I think we'll be growing bananas here in Arletale soon with climate  change.  But that's a major factor.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:38:12):**  And then what you actually need to do to improve carbon.  And I think part of addressing the risk to get more producers into carbon markets is  giving them information and data and first-hand experience on what actually works to improve  
**[0:38:23-0:38:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:38:23):**  carbon.  Some of our users have come to us and said, I've taken soil carbon tests for the last  few years for my farm.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:38:30):**  Here's the picture.  I don't know what's going on.  I thought I was improving carbon and then it dropped off.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:38:35):**  And there's a big education piece there because carbon isn't always going to improve linearly  in a straight line, even if you do the exact right thing.  Climate is often the biggest factor, especially in Australia with drought.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:38:46):**  So I really emphasise the communication piece, whether you're using farm lab or not, it's  so important just to understand, to just start thinking about it now and start taking those  measurements.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:38:56):**  People are asking why is it so conservative and so expensive to measure carbon and model  well, carbon in the soil isn't like carbon in the atmosphere.  You can't send a weather balloon up and measure carbon in one spot and get an answer for the  
**[0:39:08-0:39:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:39:08):**  southern hemisphere, right?  Because carbon doesn't work like that in the ground.  Soil carbon doesn't move around.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:39:15):**  It's usually paddock specific.  So it depends on what you're doing in that specific paddock.  Even beyond that, it's soil type specific.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:39:21):**  So there are a lot of complexities that right now, the easiest way to solve that for carbon  markets is just to measure everywhere, right?  But we know there's a huge cost involved.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:39:32):**  So understanding what you can do and to extrapolating that out across the farm, maybe use a paddock  as a test site, take some measurements, building up that picture will help, I think, people  get more into carbon.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:39:46):**  And that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.

**[0:01:23-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:01:23):**  resources to build a methodology that costs $15 to $50 a ton to maintain when there's

**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:02:20):**  And to round out the discussion, we've gone to the big end of town to learn how multinational  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:02:23):**  agribusinesses are bridging the gap between consumers' demand for carbon neutral food

**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:02:44):**  And that's often what we find ourselves being asked about externally.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:02:48):**  But when talking with farmers, it's as much farmer resilience as it is anything.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:02:55):**  We start out the discussion jumping into a big question on everyone's mind.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:02:59):**  How do we lower the costs for producers to participate while still ensuring the credits  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:03:04):**  are legit?  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:03:05):**  Alden from Nori shares her views first.

**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:03:14):**  buy carbon credits from farmers back in the 1990s.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:03:18):**  In doing this, Alden learned a lot about market inefficiencies and costs and what governments  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:03:23):**  and the private sector can do to overcome these challenges.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:03:27):**  And at the time, we originally went to the science community and said, what do farmers  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:03:32):**  have to do to provide us credible credits demonstrating soil organic carbon stock change  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:03:38):**  in the world's leading soil scientists, including Rattan, Lal, Cezar, Zerald, and Keith Postion,

**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:03:48):**  or credit if we think one ton per acre per year on average to quantify and verify their

**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:04:10):**  Collaborate government and the private sector to set up what we call a network of soil sample  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:04:15):**  reference or experimental sites.

**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:04:25):**  what's the smallest number of sites that you want to do very, very, very, very comprehensive  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:04:31):**  and expensive soil sampling and testing on a predictable and good cycle.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:04:37):**  So that the data that is coming out of those sites informs a model and enables you to extrapolate

**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:05:07):**  It's not knowing the uncertainties that shuts us down.

**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:05:40):**  You're just paying somewhere between 15 and 50.

**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:07:46):**  Let's not get the government funding very expensive site-specific soil sampling and

**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:08:25):**  the total sites overlap the regions that have the greatest potential and the greatest population

**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:08:40):**  how do we set up the representative reference of sites, you'll need way less soil sampling

**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:09:21):**  models to lower the cost of soil carbon measurement in particular.

**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:09:31):**  that takes place across a farm because you don't just set out to farm carbon.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:09:36):**  Most of the time, you also farm something else like cattle or crops.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:09:40):**  So these two things really need to go hand in hand.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:09:43):**  When it comes to managing the soil, we need to be realistic here.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:09:46):**  We're not just managing carbon across the landscape.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:09:48):**  We're also managing fertility and other bits and pieces.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:09:51):**  Fortunately for us, and the science is pretty clear on this, is they go hand in hand.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:09:55):**  Sam is intimately familiar with the significant risks, costs and challenges that farmers are

**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:05):**  The last I saw, which is probably a few months old now, but there are only 68 soil carbon  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:09):**  projects across Australia accumulating carbon credits.

**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:16):**  But it's not a whole lot, particularly given the Australian methodology has been in existence  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:20):**  since 2012.

**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:28):**  sequestering soil carbon and entering into these projects.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:30):**  Now there's two things I've flagged here.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:33):**  First is that soil carbon projects are relatively expensive, which Oleson has gone through in  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:37):**  a lot of detail.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:38):**  I think he said $80 a hectare to improve soil carbon.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:41):**  We estimate the projects we see are about, it costs about $50,000 to undertake baselining  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:46):**  as part of those soil carbon projects.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:47):**  So it's not cheap.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:49):**  And then the risk reward itself is also not proven.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:52):**  We have had some soil carbon credits be issued.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:54):**  Some of the first carbon credits were issued probably 6-12 months ago now, I think through  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:10:59):**  projects down in Victoria, which was absolutely fantastic.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:02):**  So that's starting to change.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:03):**  We're starting to see, I guess, our heroes in this space, the producers that are actually  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:08):**  able to go out and say this worked for me, which is a real fundamental barrier to overcome  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:13):**  in terms of the adoption of these projects, but they're still super expensive.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:16):**  And the reason for that is because the Australian method for measurement is very conservative.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:22):**  You know, for producers, it's like, I know as a small business owner, if I came to you  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:26):**  and I said, hey, look, if you pay me $80,000, I might give you a million dollars 10-15 years  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:32):**  down the track, right?  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:33):**  Now that's really good, but are you going to, for a small business owner, are you going  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:37):**  to be around 10-15 years down the track?  
**[0:11:39-0:11:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:39):**  What do you have to do to get that?  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:40):**  And there's all these regulatory things in place that are really restrictive.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:44):**  So putting this back into the farmer's perspective, for the farmer to enter into these 15-20-25  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:50):**  projects, there's a lot of risk there, which can be really, really off-putting.  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:11:54):**  Alden says it's not just Australia's government regulated market that's plagued with inefficiencies.

**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:12:40):**  that farmers are already sequestering carbon in soil without an extra incentive, just because

**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:12:54):**  And I'm talking about the Regent Ag farmers, the ones that have seen the benefits, the

**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:20:10):**  So carbon is the lingua franca of sustainability.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:20:15):**  It comes up in so many areas and touches on so many elements.

**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:21:41):**  There's a lot of debate about where is the consumer preference, where is it driving,  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:21:45):**  where is it headed.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:21:46):**  I think that we have seen a lot of shifts that track with changing demographics.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:21:54):**  And so there are certainly shifts that are predictable.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:21:56):**  But some of the sort of equally powerful demographic shifts are that rising GDP leads to rising

**[0:22:14-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:22:14):**  a way to navigate it.

**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:22:34):**  And you see certain brands are leaning into that in the US right now.

**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:22:51):**  Let's jump back to the panel discussion.

**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:23:22):**  you see that changing in the future?

**[0:25:02-0:25:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:25:02):**  Do you want to talk a little bit more about that?

**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:25:17):**  Average US crop producer through $27 to $40 an acre to the bottom line over the last five

**[0:25:48-0:25:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:25:48):**  you don't have to hire a consultant and pay them $50,000 to interpret the 145-page protocol.

**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:26:15):**  Our quantification method is a method that informs the US national inventory.

**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:26:25):**  actually do or have been assigned authority to control the project by the owners of the

**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:06):**  Do you want to kind of explain how what you guys do fits in?  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:09):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:10):**  I mean, there's a whole range of different ways that you can account for carbon.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:13):**  And we work very much under the compliance market in an Australian context.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:18):**  So I guess in more of the traditional type carbon markets where I guess offsets integrity  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:24):**  standards, so legislative standards around sort of transparency and measurement.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:28):**  And it's very much a regulated framework that we work under.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:33):**  So we apply methodologies that are all peer reviewed, and then we apply them working with  
**[0:27:37-0:27:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:37):**  landholders in particular properties.

**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:43):**  And then we generally sell those units either to the government as a buyer, and they report  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:48):**  on them for the United Nations targets, or as Sam mentioned, what we're starting to see  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:52):**  a lot more of in the last 6-12 months is corporate organisations globally starting to take a  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:27:58):**  very strong interest in net zero emissions targets or sustainable development goal targets.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:04):**  And so we're starting to see significant buying in that part of the market for voluntary reasons.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:10):**  But the key bit that buyers are looking to see is the integrity of the offset.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:15):**  And what are the co-benefits?  
**[0:28:16-0:28:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:16):**  There's this term co-benefits that everyone talks about.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:19):**  And it's critically important to be able to explicitly measure and verify and demonstrate  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:26):**  what the impact of that carbon project has been in relation to social and community benefits,  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:31):**  if it's working with traditional owner communities, biodiversity benefits, water quality benefits.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:36):**  It's not enough to say, oh, these are these sort of amorphous nice benefits that come  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:41):**  from our carbon project.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:43):**  You need to measure and verify how those co-benefits are being generated.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:47):**  And that will increase the value of the offset.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:49):**  Sam, do you want to just close the loop kind of on how FarmLab fits into this?  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:53):**  So we see the journey of the farmer in terms of their soil management journey starting  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:28:58):**  before they even start to think about carbon, right?  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:00):**  So a lot of our users come to us before they enter into a carbon project, the consultants  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:04):**  start using the software, they'll upload a bunch of historic results, because they've  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:07):**  already been playing with soil carbon and trying to improve it and trying to improve  
**[0:29:11-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:11):**  it in line with yields and reduction of inputs, right?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:14):**  And then, you know, what was found is that they'll seek out somebody like Green Collar  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:18):**  to embark on a, you know, formally registered project, Green Collar will then go and provide  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:23):**  all the information around the different markets out there, the different ways you can improve  
**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:28):**  carbon.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:29):**  And then we just sit there and we kind of act as a communication tool between somebody  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:32):**  like Green Collar, the consultants and the farmer.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:34):**  So the farmer can actually see what's changing and get the visual picture rather than just  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:38):**  hearing about carbon credits.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:39):**  And, you know, because there's a lot of complex, especially when you start to actually dive  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:43):**  into the calculations, you know, there's a lot of complex calculations that go into determining  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:49):**  how much carbon has been improved per hectare based on a single soil sample, right?  
**[0:29:53-0:29:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:53):**  So it's very statistical.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:29:55):**  So we try and take a lot of that statistical maths out of it by just showing a picture  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:01):**  and showing the changes of carbon over time and giving the, you know, improving that communication.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:05):**  So there was a few points raised there, but I wanted to go to Matt actually, and there's  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:09):**  a question in the audience that relates to this, like if KPMG or Qantas are paying $40,  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:15):**  there's different ways for corporates to participate in this space and Cargill is a corporate with  
**[0:30:19-0:30:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:19):**  farmers in their supply chain.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:21):**  How are you guys thinking about kind of voluntary versus compliance markets and how to kind  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:26):**  of play in the space?  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:28):**  Sure.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:29):**  So I mentioned earlier that I think framing carbon as a crop for a farmer is an important  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:35):**  place to start, especially when you consider that, you know, on a farm by farm basis, it's  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:39):**  likely that carbon as a source of revenue will never be the major source of revenue.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:44):**  It's going to be something that they can, that an individual producer can produce and  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:49):**  it requires, you know, inputs and expertise and, you know, you worry about yield and pricing  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:53):**  and so on.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:54):**  But all of these carbon products are fundamentally data products at their core.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:30:59):**  And so whether the data that you use to create the credit and you call a credit a representation  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:06):**  of data, according to some protocol, whether you take that credit into a voluntary market  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:12):**  or a compliance market or an insetting market or some other scheme, you know, I would love  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:16):**  to get to a point where there is flexibility and we can bring different market options  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:21):**  to farmers, you know, where maybe the rigor of measurement and verification from one program  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:26):**  is different than what a farmer might align with for, you know, what they're ready to  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:30):**  do.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:31):**  And so that's fine because there's another program that's ready in there.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:34):**  In general, we like to say that the quality of data is only something that can be measured  
**[0:31:41-0:31:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:41):**  against fitness for commercial purpose.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:44):**  And we see a lot of black and white data quality discussions out there around soil carbon that  
**[0:31:49-0:31:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:49):**  I think misses the potential just richness of commercial purposes out there.  
**[0:31:56-0:31:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:56):**  So KPMG at $40 a ton, great.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:31:59):**  You know, the government at a lower price per ton, you know, maybe that's fine for farmers  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:32:03):**  to pursue and different markets are fine because they can value that data to different degrees,

**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:38:35):**  And there's a big education piece there because carbon isn't always going to improve linearly  
**[0:38:39-0:38:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:38:39):**  in a straight line, even if you do the exact right thing.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:38:42):**  Climate is often the biggest factor, especially in Australia with drought.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:38:46):**  So I really emphasise the communication piece, whether you're using farm lab or not, it's

**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:39:03):**  You can't send a weather balloon up and measure carbon in one spot and get an answer for the

**[0:39:13-0:39:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:39:13):**  Soil carbon doesn't move around.

**[0:39:16-0:39:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:39:16):**  So it depends on what you're doing in that specific paddock.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:39:20):**  Even beyond that, it's soil type specific.

**[0:39:27-0:39:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/2/scaling-up-soil-carbon-markets#t=0:39:27):**  markets is just to measure everywhere, right?

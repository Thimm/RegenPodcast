### Agtech - So What?  (2019-10-23)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:22-0:00:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:00:22):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. Today's guest is Murray Scholes. Murray farms  
**[0:00:44-0:00:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:00:44):**  with his wife, Emma, in southern New South Wales and the eastern Riverina on the foothills  of the snowy mountains of Australia. They grow wheat, canola, lupins, and barley and  run beef cattle and prime lambs. Murray's family has been on this land a while. His  
**[0:00:59-0:01:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:00:59):**  great grandfather came to the area in 1919, so they're celebrating their hundredth year  this year. They've always been an innovative family, adopting new practices and striving  to improve. Murray shares a number of stories on how his thinking has changed and how he's  
**[0:01:14-0:01:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:01:14):**  using data and technologies to make decisions. We start off with Murray telling me about  what it was like to grow up with a father who was also innovative and pushed the boundaries.  It was probably a really great asset to have because it encouraged me to have the ethos  
**[0:01:30-0:01:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:01:30):**  of probably always questioning what we're doing and trying to find a better way of doing  things. And so that's how we've always sort of run our farm. We've always tried to find  better ways of doing things and ways that either reduce work or give us better agronomic  
**[0:01:47-0:02:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:01:47):**  outcomes or more profit, and ideally all three if we can. In 2008 Murray received a Nuffield  scholarship and he set off on a global trip to explore how genetically modified herbicide-tolerant  crops were impacting weed management. But how'd he get the idea for this? It was actually  
**[0:02:04-0:02:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:02:04):**  my wife's fault. She encouraged me to apply. She knew I was probably looking to extend  myself. I was probably a bit restless and wanted to get out and try and find some more  information and grow myself. She's an educator. She actually teaches at a university and we  
**[0:02:24-0:02:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:02:24):**  place a great deal of value on education. And she really felt I had the urge to want  to improve myself. And so I'm glad she did. It was one of the better things that she's  talked me into. I think a lot of good ideas could be accredited that way. I'm maybe not  
**[0:02:43-0:03:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:02:43):**  surprised. Although I won't say that for myself. My partner never has any good ideas. One of  the things that I could imagine was that some of your work was potentially controversial  in that you looked at a lot of the genetic modification technologies coming online during  
**[0:03:01-0:03:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:03:01):**  that time. Did you get pushback or interest or were you right in the middle of that controversy  at all? Yeah, I got a lot of both actually. So with my Nuffield topic, I decided to have  a look at how genetically modified herbicide tolerant crops, what impact they had had on  
**[0:03:19-0:03:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:03:19):**  weed management. And it was quite timely because it was 2008, which was the year that both  New South Wales and Victoria lifted the moratorium on growing GM canola. So I couldn't have timed  it better for people to be interested. So I went and had a look at GM crops in North  
**[0:03:38-0:03:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:03:38):**  America, in Canada and the US. And I also went and looked at organic farming in Europe  to see what sort of things that they were doing where they weren't using herbicides.  And it was a really interesting time because at that stage there were a lot of issues with  
**[0:03:56-0:04:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:03:56):**  resistance building to glyphosate and the farming community weren't very aware of it.  The researchers certainly were, but the farmers really weren't. It seems confusing to me that  if that was the case, wouldn't the farmers be seeing that or is it that it hadn't shown  
**[0:04:15-0:04:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:04:15):**  up? How is that possible? So it was starting to show up. So farmers were starting to notice  that they had glyphosate resistant weeds, things like kosher and water hemp, Parma amaranth  was a big one, especially in the cotton in the South, the US South. But they had sort  
**[0:04:34-0:04:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:04:34):**  of been dealing with it by changing GM technologies, if that makes sense. So using a different  moving to a glyphosate resistant crop. But it was quite interesting at that time there  was also very little herbicide resistance in the GM crops in Canada versus the US. And  
**[0:04:54-0:05:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:04:54):**  so my findings really came back at the end of the day, it didn't really matter whether  the crop was a GM crop or not. It was more about the management and how farmers were  dealing with weeds. So the experience that I saw in North America, especially in the  
**[0:05:11-0:05:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:05:11):**  US was that farmers had walked away from what were a lot of integrated weed management techniques.  We didn't call them that at the time, like things like cultivation, crop competition,  all those sorts of things that they were doing. And they just sort of threw all of that out  
**[0:05:31-0:05:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:05:31):**  and just embraced using glyphosate for their total weed control. And so they put this extraordinary  reliance on one herbicide and it was just starting to really fail in the US. Whereas  in Canada, they had more diverse rotations. They were still using pre-emergent herbicides  
**[0:05:52-0:06:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:05:52):**  and glyphosate resistance really wasn't showing up very much at all. And so it was a real  eye-opener for me that at the end of the day, it's quality of management that dictates success  in especially things like weed management. Herbicide resistance is usually a failure  
**[0:06:10-0:06:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:06:10):**  of management. We've put too much emphasis on one technology and not used multiple efforts  to deal with the problem. And weeds are very clever. If you keep hitting them in one way,  they're going to work out how to get around it. And that's what's happened in North America  
**[0:06:31-0:06:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:06:31):**  and it's happened here in Australia too. Australia's got lots of herbicide resistance, not much  of it because of GM crops, almost none of it actually. But at the end of the day, it's  usually because we've been, herbicides work so well. They're cheap and they're effective  
**[0:06:49-0:07:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:06:49):**  and they're easy. And so it's not surprising that as a group, we've embraced them because  they did such a good job, but then we got lazy and forgot about doing other things so  that they kept being useful.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:07:04):**  Murray's findings that there aren't any silver bullet solutions, especially in natural systems,  landed him right in the middle of a global controversy that's still a big one today.  So when I released my report, it really, I actually had two phone calls the day it was  
**[0:07:20-0:07:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:07:20):**  released. One was from a major company that is renowned for their GM products, who will  remain nameless, but who really wanted me to change my report. They didn't like the  fact that I'd put about GM crops in there and the fact that the technology could fail,  
**[0:07:42-0:07:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:07:42):**  even though I really wasn't saying that, I was saying it was the management of the technology  that was the issue. And then I also had, on the other side of the GM debate, I had people  who are very anti GM wanting me to change my report to say, no, it wasn't the management,  
**[0:07:57-0:08:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:07:57):**  it was the fact that it was GM. So I was in the middle and getting it from both sides.  When those phone calls happened, how did that make you feel?  I wasn't very happy actually, because I felt that neither side of the argument had actually  
**[0:08:14-0:08:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:08:14):**  taken the time to look and see what I'd actually said. I was very clear that I wasn't talking  about GM technology. I was talking about how people use technology and just happened to  be that the technology was GM.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:08:29):**  Yeah, some interesting parallels with technology in general. It's not just GM that the tech  can get the criticism, but like anything, it's just a tool and it depends much more  how you use it and where it's applied in the system.  
**[0:08:42-0:09:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:08:42):**  Yeah, I totally agree. And for me, the epiphany moment for me on my scholarship was when I  was standing in a wheat field in Denmark. It was an organic crop and it was a beautiful  location. The Baltic Sea was right at the edge of the field. So literally three metres  
**[0:09:03-0:09:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:09:03):**  from where the wheat grew was actual Baltic Sea. And they had a real issue with perennial  thistles and they couldn't control them anymore with cultivation because they were too deep-rooted  and they couldn't cultivate deep enough to kill them. And so they actually had weeds  
**[0:09:24-0:09:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:09:24):**  resistant to cultivation. And it really opened my mind to that where you use one technology  to fix a problem, whether it be a management or some piece of technology, if you're only  using the one thing to do it, eventually it's going to fail.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:09:43):**  Murray says this experience was life-changing, really challenging him to be a better farmer  and businessman by looking at issues from multiple perspectives. So did he come back  with any specific technologies to implement?  
**[0:09:56-0:10:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:09:56):**  Probably not a lot. It was probably more a gradual evolution thing, not revolution. Certainly  it helped me become a better business manager and it really showed me the importance of  that. As farmers, while we do a lot of things, like we're agronomists and we take a lot of  
**[0:10:17-0:10:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:10:17):**  pride in growing our crops or raising our livestock, we are also a business and it really  showed me the importance of really having good quality business skills. And that's something  I put a lot of effort into afterwards of improving my skills and trying to lift at another level.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:10:38):**  Murray has made one pretty big change in his operation that came from this approach of  finding ways to turn challenges into opportunities. This one required a bit of humility as well.  He changed his mind about something, adopting a practice that he said he'd never do.  
**[0:10:53-0:11:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:10:53):**  Yes, if you search on YouTube you can find videos of me saying how much I hate sheep  and we now run several thousand sheep. So it was one of those things that watching my  next door neighbour turn his herbicide resistant rye grass into very valuable prime lambs really  
**[0:11:13-0:11:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:11:13):**  set me thinking. What made me interested in choosing the topic of looking at weed management  for my scholarship was the fact that we'd been dealing with a herbicide resistance issue  in our cropping program. It was taking a lot of effort and a lot of money and having an  
**[0:11:33-0:11:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:11:33):**  impact on our profitability. And here's my neighbour, he's just turning it into something  quite profitable and desirable in prime lamb. And so that really got me thinking and I went  and did the executive program for agricultural producers at Texas A&M a few years back and  
**[0:11:54-0:12:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:11:54):**  that encouraged me to think about where's opportunities in problems. And so we sort  of looked at it and decided maybe we should be running sheep. And when we sat down we  thought why is it that we don't like sheep? And it was usually because it was hard work.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:12:14):**  Every time you did something with them it was stressful and gut busting. So we looked  at it and went well what's the price of a new set of sheep yards? And it actually wasn't  that expensive. It was less than the price of a new you. So we put in a new set of sheep  
**[0:12:31-0:12:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:12:31):**  yards when we bought some sheep and suddenly they weren't that much hard work. And the  profitability and the ability to deal with issues like the resistant ryegrass and make  it into a more profitable product has been quite a success for us. And it's probably  
**[0:12:52-0:13:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:12:52):**  led us down the road of evolving our farming system to be probably less risk based as the  climate seems to be evolving and becoming a little bit more variable. Growing crop as  a main enterprise has become more and more risky because you're putting in a lot of,  
**[0:13:16-0:13:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:13:16):**  spending a lot of money and running livestock is probably, as part of the business, is sometimes  it's probably maybe a little less profitable on a per hectare basis. So the last few years  it hasn't been. But it's also much lower risk because you're not spending so much money  
**[0:13:34-0:13:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:13:34):**  up front and then having to wait six months or longer to get an outcome that's dependent  on the weather. It's interesting, I think the cold hard facts approach to some of these  decisions would lead to quicker change. I think doing the calculation on the yards and  
**[0:13:53-0:14:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:13:53):**  then buying the sheep and looking at this. But that's not really how people make decisions,  right? There's lots of emotion wrapped up in it. For you, were you thinking about the  YouTube videos where you had said that you didn't like sheep when you were getting sheep?  
**[0:14:06-0:14:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:14:06):**  Was there any element of pride in that? Oh yes, very much so. I still get mocked when  I go into town sometimes and people stir me up and say, how do you like that wool check?  I quite enjoy it to be honest. That's one of the things I say. I still don't terribly  
**[0:14:26-0:14:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:14:26):**  love sheep but gosh I like the check at the end of the day. At the end of the day we're  running a business and while it's important to be doing what you like in your workplace,  at the end of the day it's also got to be a profitable business. For us, we looked at  
**[0:14:44-0:15:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:14:44):**  it as part of a system and so our farming system has evolved and sheep have let us make  some changes that we think have increased the profitability and certainly reduced the  risk. While I don't totally enjoy being mocked, changing my mind quite so dramatically, I  
**[0:15:07-0:15:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:15:07):**  do know that for us it's been a very successful outcome and I would do it again. I should  have probably done it earlier. It's such an interesting theme because when we started  talking here before where you were talking about your dad and how that kind of challenging  
**[0:15:23-0:15:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:15:23):**  different mindsets and that was something you learned from your enough field as well  and then you've actually implemented it in the business. It's quite a theme actually.  I imagine it's not easy to make tough decisions and it's not easy to push the envelope. Have  
**[0:15:36-0:15:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:15:36):**  you taught this kind of thick skinned and evidence-based decision making to your kids?  Are they learning some of the same lessons?  Yeah definitely. We're very much believers in data and using data and evidence to make  
**[0:15:51-0:16:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:15:51):**  decisions and we've certainly encouraged them to do the same thing with their own lives  and to make their own choices but to encourage them to look and not just look at one source  because we all get quite passionate about various things that we care about and we can  
**[0:16:09-0:16:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:16:09):**  often we can sometimes gild the lily a little bit in how good things are and so it's really  yeah we've really encouraged our kids that if you're going to think about something and  take a position make sure you've considered it from multiple points of view not just the  
**[0:16:25-0:16:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:16:25):**  first one you've heard.  This theme of data-driven decision making is a big one in ag right now at a time when  emotions are running hot and decisions are not always evidence-based. One especially  
**[0:16:38-0:16:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:16:38):**  complicated area is ecosystem services and natural capital. Recently Murray took a hiking  trip to Switzerland with his family and this has shaped some of his views.  Yeah we had a very enjoyable family holiday and part of that was we went for a hike through  
**[0:16:54-0:17:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:16:54):**  the Swiss Alps. We got out of a train at the top of the path and walked down a valley through  the forests and then down through the fields the meadows through a couple villages where  there was milking cows with their bells ringing and it was an incredibly beautiful landscape  
**[0:17:14-0:17:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:17:14):**  and an incredibly enjoyable afternoon but my wife and I spent a fair bit of it discussing  about what was going on around us. The fact that there was a lot of these small farms  you know that the houses were in the villages and the barns for the cows were in the back  
**[0:17:31-0:17:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:17:31):**  of the houses so the cows were actually coming through the village and it was a really interesting  place and it showed we did a bit of research and I discovered that you know most farms  in Switzerland are incredibly small like I believe the average is only 23 cows per farm  
**[0:17:50-0:18:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:17:50):**  but they still are quite from what we could see they look like they were doing quite well  financially and apparently they paid quite a bit of money to provide ecosystems and social  outcomes so that the farms are still occupied and they get paid not to spray the flowers  
**[0:18:09-0:18:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:18:09):**  out of the meadows and it was a really interesting experience because it showed that there are  successful models out there. The society has chosen they want people to be living in the  country areas and they want them to manage that countryside so it's pretty and not only  
**[0:18:29-0:18:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:18:29):**  pretty but it's providing environmental services like protecting the wildlife and the flowers  and the trees and all that sort of stuff and here in Australia we've got a very different  culture and I'm not suggesting that we're about to do that we should go down the road  
**[0:18:48-0:19:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:18:48):**  of getting direct payment to manage ecosystems but it does sort of temper the argument that  there aren't people out there that aren't successfully doing it you know it can be done  and it can be done very well.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:19:02):**  This is a complex issue for sure and there aren't easy answers or solutions. One thing  that we believe can help is maybe not surprisingly technology because with new technology comes  new business models and the ability to break trade-offs so I wanted to ask Murray about  
**[0:19:18-0:19:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:19:18):**  the tech that he's using how he's using data to make decisions and how it's changed over  time.  Yeah we've been a big user of technology I like my gadgets I must admit and so we've  
**[0:19:32-0:19:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:19:32):**  been keeping electronic records of what we do on the farm since 1997 which has been for  the first 10 years we sort of wondered why I was doing it but it's given us a massive  database that we can go in and have a look at and take a long-term view of what different  
**[0:19:55-0:20:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:19:55):**  practices give us financially as well as agronomically which has been it's the value of big data  if you haven't got that data set you can't find the information and building up the data  set was hard work but as we go forward it's been a really really useful tool and it's  
**[0:20:13-0:20:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:20:13):**  been to make some of those more difficult decisions it's been very valuable because  we can look in and go every paddock on our farm I've done a gross margin of for 15 years  so I can tell you how much money we've made off that paddock in the last 15 years profit  
**[0:20:32-0:20:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:20:32):**  and you know so that's given us the ability to pick out some of our paddocks that are  lower performers and go okay we're probably better off turning these into pastures long-term  pastures because they are too high risk because they're actually the thing that actually knocks  
**[0:20:49-0:21:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:20:49):**  the profitability of those paddocks is that they get too wet that's not the dry because  in dry years every paddock gets hammered but in the wet years the paddocks that get really  really wet also get hammered so we've sort of taken that strategic decision because we've  
**[0:21:06-0:21:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:21:06):**  got the data to back it up it gives us a lot more confidence to make the decision to change  Murray says that having all these data has allowed him to ask and answer questions that  he didn't even know he had the ability to go in and ask questions and find out information  
**[0:21:24-0:21:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:21:24):**  is really really quite valuable and when we started I didn't think I'd be wanting to know  all sorts of things you know you sort of you don't know what you want to ask until you've  got the database and you realize you can ask the question is there an example of something  
**[0:21:42-0:21:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:21:42):**  like that where you never would have imagined asking that of the data and now you've found  it useful to have things like just sitting down and working out say how much fertilizer  we've put in and taken out over the last 20 something years if I had to do it manually  
**[0:21:57-0:22:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:21:57):**  I wouldn't take the time whereas because I've got the database I can actually do it in about  30 seconds wow that's I feel like that's everyone's dream now is they want a system that they  like that does analytics but they also want uploading of the records for the past 20 years  
**[0:22:16-0:22:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:22:16):**  and no one unfortunately gets that unless someone enters in all those back of the envelope  calculations somewhere exactly yeah exactly and like I wouldn't like to be start trying  to start where I am get to where I am now starting from scratch it's it's really difficult  
**[0:22:33-0:22:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:22:33):**  to you know it just takes time there's no other way you can do it really another technology  that Murray has used with some pretty great results is variable rate so we've been using  things like auto steer and yield mapping for a long time and about five or six years ago  
**[0:22:51-0:23:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:22:51):**  we actually got into pH mapping and we've we now do variable rate line which has been  a big win-win for us because it's helped reduce our costs and we've gotten a better outcome  because we'd have places where traditionally we just put say two ton of lime per hectare  
**[0:23:12-0:23:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:23:12):**  every so many years and now with the testing we can find spots that actually need four  tonne to the hectare so if we put the two tonne on it still was going to have issues  and at the same time there was other areas that maybe only needed one tonne or half a  
**[0:23:30-0:23:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:23:30):**  tonne so we've been able to reduce our overall consumption of lime but get a much better  outcome and we're seeing that flow through then with the yield maps we're seeing a lot  more evenness and the other thing that we're seeing out of it is where the really really  
**[0:23:48-0:24:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:23:48):**  acid patches in the paddocks were tended to be where we'd have issues with weeds because  weeds often tend to be slightly more acid tolerant than the crops we were trying to  grow so it's been also an integrated weed management technique which we weren't at all  
**[0:24:04-0:24:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:24:04):**  expecting but it was a great outcome.  A positive example of unintended consequences.  Murray has also looked at software to help him and his team manage tasks and keep a shared  
**[0:24:19-0:24:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:24:19):**  to-do list of the jobs that need to get done.  We certainly use a number of apps we're just using a new one now.  I've got several people work for me and we have a management app that lets any of us  
**[0:24:33-0:24:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:24:33):**  put on tasks they see that need to do and if I'm not on the farm I can actually just  look up my phone and see what's been done and what hasn't been done and so that's been  a real help to us to improve our efficiency and it lets me not be on the farm quite as  
**[0:24:50-0:25:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:24:50):**  much as I used to be which is also helpful so that's been a winner.  In looking at so many different technologies including apps Murray has some advice for  ag tech companies that are developing or trying to develop new tools for farmers.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:25:06):**  We've probably wasted a bit of money and time trying stuff over the years but I think one  of the things I've worked out is that if you've got a problem the technology is probably going  to be a lot more useful to you if the technology that's providing a solution is going to be  
**[0:25:25-0:25:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:25:25):**  a lot more useful to us.  It's one of the things I see a lot in technology is that in people trying to sell software  or apps they're trying to sell solutions to problems that might not even really exist.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:25:39):**  I think if I could give a message to software developers is to actually go out and find  the issue and work out how to fix that first and really get that working really well and  then move on then.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:25:54):**  Another thing that he's come to appreciate is the importance of simplicity.  One thing I found is because I spent about six months trying to find something that was  workable because a lot of the programs that are made for city-based businesses have a  
**[0:26:12-0:26:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:26:12):**  degree of complexity, some of them are quite complex and difficult to use for, you know,  and I didn't want my staff having to sort of be afraid to use it because they were worried  they would stuff something up or they were higher cost or yeah they just weren't really  
**[0:26:31-0:26:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:26:31):**  working that well for us because they don't need to be as complex because we're not shifting  lots of data around and that sort of thing.  So yeah I reckon there's probably a market in the Ag sector for more of those task sharing  
**[0:26:46-0:26:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:26:46):**  software that is simple to use but has the ability to get more complex, to add complexity  to it if you need it.  Great, well we'll have to get you more involved in the Ag Tech space.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:26:58):**  I know there are a lot of startups that would really benefit from your knowledge and your  open mind and your approach to start with problems and find solutions so I think there's  a big opportunity there.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:27:08):**  I guess I'll, if it's alright with you, I'll share your Twitter handle as a place for people  to look or follow or find more out about you.  Is there anywhere else that they should look to other than the videos that I'm sure they'll  
**[0:27:19-0:27:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:27:19):**  Google to hear you criticising sheep?  Anywhere else they should look to find you?  Yeah, you can also follow into our business on Facebook at Shoals Farming.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:27:29):**  We probably don't update it quite as much as we should but we like to share with some  of the interesting stuff we're doing.  Yeah, great, I will include a link to that as well in the show notes.

### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 18:54:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:00:12):**  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:00:17):**  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:00:22):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:00:27):**  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  
**[0:00:31-0:00:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:00:31):**  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. Today's guest is Murray Scholes. Murray farms  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:00:44):**  with his wife, Emma, in southern New South Wales and the eastern Riverina on the foothills  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:00:48):**  of the snowy mountains of Australia. They grow wheat, canola, lupins, and barley and  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:00:53):**  run beef cattle and prime lambs. Murray's family has been on this land a while. His  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:00:59):**  great grandfather came to the area in 1919, so they're celebrating their hundredth year  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:01:03):**  this year. They've always been an innovative family, adopting new practices and striving  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:01:09):**  to improve. Murray shares a number of stories on how his thinking has changed and how he's  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:01:14):**  using data and technologies to make decisions. We start off with Murray telling me about  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:01:19):**  what it was like to grow up with a father who was also innovative and pushed the boundaries.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:01:23):**  It was probably a really great asset to have because it encouraged me to have the ethos  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:01:30):**  of probably always questioning what we're doing and trying to find a better way of doing  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:01:35):**  things. And so that's how we've always sort of run our farm. We've always tried to find  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:01:41):**  better ways of doing things and ways that either reduce work or give us better agronomic  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:01:47):**  outcomes or more profit, and ideally all three if we can. In 2008 Murray received a Nuffield  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:01:53):**  scholarship and he set off on a global trip to explore how genetically modified herbicide-tolerant  
**[0:01:58-0:02:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:01:58):**  crops were impacting weed management. But how'd he get the idea for this? It was actually  
**[0:02:04-0:02:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:02:04):**  my wife's fault. She encouraged me to apply. She knew I was probably looking to extend  
**[0:02:11-0:02:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:02:11):**  myself. I was probably a bit restless and wanted to get out and try and find some more  
**[0:02:17-0:02:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:02:17):**  information and grow myself. She's an educator. She actually teaches at a university and we  
**[0:02:24-0:02:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:02:24):**  place a great deal of value on education. And she really felt I had the urge to want  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:02:31):**  to improve myself. And so I'm glad she did. It was one of the better things that she's  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:02:37):**  talked me into. I think a lot of good ideas could be accredited that way. I'm maybe not  
**[0:02:43-0:02:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:02:43):**  surprised. Although I won't say that for myself. My partner never has any good ideas. One of  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:02:50):**  the things that I could imagine was that some of your work was potentially controversial  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:02:56):**  in that you looked at a lot of the genetic modification technologies coming online during  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:03:01):**  that time. Did you get pushback or interest or were you right in the middle of that controversy  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:03:06):**  at all? Yeah, I got a lot of both actually. So with my Nuffield topic, I decided to have  
**[0:03:11-0:03:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:03:11):**  a look at how genetically modified herbicide tolerant crops, what impact they had had on  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:03:19):**  weed management. And it was quite timely because it was 2008, which was the year that both  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:03:25):**  New South Wales and Victoria lifted the moratorium on growing GM canola. So I couldn't have timed  
**[0:03:31-0:03:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:03:31):**  it better for people to be interested. So I went and had a look at GM crops in North  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:03:38):**  America, in Canada and the US. And I also went and looked at organic farming in Europe  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:03:44):**  to see what sort of things that they were doing where they weren't using herbicides.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:03:50):**  And it was a really interesting time because at that stage there were a lot of issues with  
**[0:03:56-0:04:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:03:56):**  resistance building to glyphosate and the farming community weren't very aware of it.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:04:04):**  The researchers certainly were, but the farmers really weren't. It seems confusing to me that  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:04:10):**  if that was the case, wouldn't the farmers be seeing that or is it that it hadn't shown  
**[0:04:15-0:04:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:04:15):**  up? How is that possible? So it was starting to show up. So farmers were starting to notice  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:04:22):**  that they had glyphosate resistant weeds, things like kosher and water hemp, Parma amaranth  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:04:28):**  was a big one, especially in the cotton in the South, the US South. But they had sort  
**[0:04:34-0:04:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:04:34):**  of been dealing with it by changing GM technologies, if that makes sense. So using a different  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:04:41):**  moving to a glyphosate resistant crop. But it was quite interesting at that time there  
**[0:04:46-0:04:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:04:46):**  was also very little herbicide resistance in the GM crops in Canada versus the US. And  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:04:54):**  so my findings really came back at the end of the day, it didn't really matter whether  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:04:59):**  the crop was a GM crop or not. It was more about the management and how farmers were  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:05:05):**  dealing with weeds. So the experience that I saw in North America, especially in the  
**[0:05:11-0:05:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:05:11):**  US was that farmers had walked away from what were a lot of integrated weed management techniques.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:05:19):**  We didn't call them that at the time, like things like cultivation, crop competition,  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:05:25):**  all those sorts of things that they were doing. And they just sort of threw all of that out  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:05:31):**  and just embraced using glyphosate for their total weed control. And so they put this extraordinary  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:05:38):**  reliance on one herbicide and it was just starting to really fail in the US. Whereas  
**[0:05:45-0:05:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:05:45):**  in Canada, they had more diverse rotations. They were still using pre-emergent herbicides  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:05:52):**  and glyphosate resistance really wasn't showing up very much at all. And so it was a real  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:05:58):**  eye-opener for me that at the end of the day, it's quality of management that dictates success  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:06:05):**  in especially things like weed management. Herbicide resistance is usually a failure  
**[0:06:10-0:06:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:06:10):**  of management. We've put too much emphasis on one technology and not used multiple efforts  
**[0:06:18-0:06:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:06:18):**  to deal with the problem. And weeds are very clever. If you keep hitting them in one way,  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:06:26):**  they're going to work out how to get around it. And that's what's happened in North America  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:06:31):**  and it's happened here in Australia too. Australia's got lots of herbicide resistance, not much  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:06:36):**  of it because of GM crops, almost none of it actually. But at the end of the day, it's  
**[0:06:42-0:06:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:06:42):**  usually because we've been, herbicides work so well. They're cheap and they're effective  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:06:49):**  and they're easy. And so it's not surprising that as a group, we've embraced them because  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:06:55):**  they did such a good job, but then we got lazy and forgot about doing other things so  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:07:01):**  that they kept being useful.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:07:04):**  Murray's findings that there aren't any silver bullet solutions, especially in natural systems,  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:07:09):**  landed him right in the middle of a global controversy that's still a big one today.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:07:15):**  So when I released my report, it really, I actually had two phone calls the day it was  
**[0:07:20-0:07:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:07:20):**  released. One was from a major company that is renowned for their GM products, who will  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:07:29):**  remain nameless, but who really wanted me to change my report. They didn't like the  
**[0:07:35-0:07:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:07:35):**  fact that I'd put about GM crops in there and the fact that the technology could fail,  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:07:42):**  even though I really wasn't saying that, I was saying it was the management of the technology  
**[0:07:45-0:07:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:07:45):**  that was the issue. And then I also had, on the other side of the GM debate, I had people  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:07:52):**  who are very anti GM wanting me to change my report to say, no, it wasn't the management,  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:07:57):**  it was the fact that it was GM. So I was in the middle and getting it from both sides.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:08:03):**  When those phone calls happened, how did that make you feel?  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:08:07):**  I wasn't very happy actually, because I felt that neither side of the argument had actually  
**[0:08:14-0:08:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:08:14):**  taken the time to look and see what I'd actually said. I was very clear that I wasn't talking  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:08:21):**  about GM technology. I was talking about how people use technology and just happened to  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:08:27):**  be that the technology was GM.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:08:29):**  Yeah, some interesting parallels with technology in general. It's not just GM that the tech  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:08:35):**  can get the criticism, but like anything, it's just a tool and it depends much more  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:08:39):**  how you use it and where it's applied in the system.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:08:42):**  Yeah, I totally agree. And for me, the epiphany moment for me on my scholarship was when I  
**[0:08:48-0:08:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:08:48):**  was standing in a wheat field in Denmark. It was an organic crop and it was a beautiful  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:08:58):**  location. The Baltic Sea was right at the edge of the field. So literally three metres  
**[0:09:03-0:09:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:09:03):**  from where the wheat grew was actual Baltic Sea. And they had a real issue with perennial  
**[0:09:11-0:09:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:09:11):**  thistles and they couldn't control them anymore with cultivation because they were too deep-rooted  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:09:18):**  and they couldn't cultivate deep enough to kill them. And so they actually had weeds  
**[0:09:24-0:09:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:09:24):**  resistant to cultivation. And it really opened my mind to that where you use one technology  
**[0:09:32-0:09:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:09:32):**  to fix a problem, whether it be a management or some piece of technology, if you're only  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:09:39):**  using the one thing to do it, eventually it's going to fail.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:09:43):**  Murray says this experience was life-changing, really challenging him to be a better farmer  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:09:48):**  and businessman by looking at issues from multiple perspectives. So did he come back  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:09:53):**  with any specific technologies to implement?  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:09:56):**  Probably not a lot. It was probably more a gradual evolution thing, not revolution. Certainly  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:10:03):**  it helped me become a better business manager and it really showed me the importance of  
**[0:10:09-0:10:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:10:09):**  that. As farmers, while we do a lot of things, like we're agronomists and we take a lot of  
**[0:10:17-0:10:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:10:17):**  pride in growing our crops or raising our livestock, we are also a business and it really  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:10:24):**  showed me the importance of really having good quality business skills. And that's something  
**[0:10:29-0:10:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:10:29):**  I put a lot of effort into afterwards of improving my skills and trying to lift at another level.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:10:38):**  Murray has made one pretty big change in his operation that came from this approach of  
**[0:10:42-0:10:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:10:42):**  finding ways to turn challenges into opportunities. This one required a bit of humility as well.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:10:49):**  He changed his mind about something, adopting a practice that he said he'd never do.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:10:53):**  Yes, if you search on YouTube you can find videos of me saying how much I hate sheep  
**[0:10:58-0:11:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:10:58):**  and we now run several thousand sheep. So it was one of those things that watching my  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:11:06):**  next door neighbour turn his herbicide resistant rye grass into very valuable prime lambs really  
**[0:11:13-0:11:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:11:13):**  set me thinking. What made me interested in choosing the topic of looking at weed management  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:11:21):**  for my scholarship was the fact that we'd been dealing with a herbicide resistance issue  
**[0:11:25-0:11:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:11:25):**  in our cropping program. It was taking a lot of effort and a lot of money and having an  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:11:33):**  impact on our profitability. And here's my neighbour, he's just turning it into something  
**[0:11:38-0:11:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:11:38):**  quite profitable and desirable in prime lamb. And so that really got me thinking and I went  
**[0:11:45-0:11:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:11:45):**  and did the executive program for agricultural producers at Texas A&M a few years back and  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:11:54):**  that encouraged me to think about where's opportunities in problems. And so we sort  
**[0:12:00-0:12:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:12:00):**  of looked at it and decided maybe we should be running sheep. And when we sat down we  
**[0:12:07-0:12:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:12:07):**  thought why is it that we don't like sheep? And it was usually because it was hard work.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:12:14):**  Every time you did something with them it was stressful and gut busting. So we looked  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:12:21):**  at it and went well what's the price of a new set of sheep yards? And it actually wasn't  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:12:25):**  that expensive. It was less than the price of a new you. So we put in a new set of sheep  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:12:31):**  yards when we bought some sheep and suddenly they weren't that much hard work. And the  
**[0:12:36-0:12:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:12:36):**  profitability and the ability to deal with issues like the resistant ryegrass and make  
**[0:12:45-0:12:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:12:45):**  it into a more profitable product has been quite a success for us. And it's probably  
**[0:12:52-0:13:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:12:52):**  led us down the road of evolving our farming system to be probably less risk based as the  
**[0:13:02-0:13:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:13:02):**  climate seems to be evolving and becoming a little bit more variable. Growing crop as  
**[0:13:09-0:13:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:13:09):**  a main enterprise has become more and more risky because you're putting in a lot of,  
**[0:13:16-0:13:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:13:16):**  spending a lot of money and running livestock is probably, as part of the business, is sometimes  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:13:24):**  it's probably maybe a little less profitable on a per hectare basis. So the last few years  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:13:29):**  it hasn't been. But it's also much lower risk because you're not spending so much money  
**[0:13:34-0:13:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:13:34):**  up front and then having to wait six months or longer to get an outcome that's dependent  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:13:41):**  on the weather. It's interesting, I think the cold hard facts approach to some of these  
**[0:13:47-0:13:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:13:47):**  decisions would lead to quicker change. I think doing the calculation on the yards and  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:13:53):**  then buying the sheep and looking at this. But that's not really how people make decisions,  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:13:57):**  right? There's lots of emotion wrapped up in it. For you, were you thinking about the  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:14:02):**  YouTube videos where you had said that you didn't like sheep when you were getting sheep?  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:14:06):**  Was there any element of pride in that? Oh yes, very much so. I still get mocked when  
**[0:14:12-0:14:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:14:12):**  I go into town sometimes and people stir me up and say, how do you like that wool check?  
**[0:14:19-0:14:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:14:19):**  I quite enjoy it to be honest. That's one of the things I say. I still don't terribly  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:14:26):**  love sheep but gosh I like the check at the end of the day. At the end of the day we're  
**[0:14:32-0:14:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:14:32):**  running a business and while it's important to be doing what you like in your workplace,  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:14:39):**  at the end of the day it's also got to be a profitable business. For us, we looked at  
**[0:14:44-0:14:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:14:44):**  it as part of a system and so our farming system has evolved and sheep have let us make  
**[0:14:52-0:14:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:14:52):**  some changes that we think have increased the profitability and certainly reduced the  
**[0:14:59-0:15:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:14:59):**  risk. While I don't totally enjoy being mocked, changing my mind quite so dramatically, I  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:15:07):**  do know that for us it's been a very successful outcome and I would do it again. I should  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:15:13):**  have probably done it earlier. It's such an interesting theme because when we started  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:15:19):**  talking here before where you were talking about your dad and how that kind of challenging  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:15:23):**  different mindsets and that was something you learned from your enough field as well  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:15:26):**  and then you've actually implemented it in the business. It's quite a theme actually.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:15:31):**  I imagine it's not easy to make tough decisions and it's not easy to push the envelope. Have  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:15:36):**  you taught this kind of thick skinned and evidence-based decision making to your kids?  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:15:41):**  Are they learning some of the same lessons?  
**[0:15:44-0:15:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:15:44):**  Yeah definitely. We're very much believers in data and using data and evidence to make  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:15:51):**  decisions and we've certainly encouraged them to do the same thing with their own lives  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:15:57):**  and to make their own choices but to encourage them to look and not just look at one source  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:16:03):**  because we all get quite passionate about various things that we care about and we can  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:16:09):**  often we can sometimes gild the lily a little bit in how good things are and so it's really  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:16:15):**  yeah we've really encouraged our kids that if you're going to think about something and  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:16:21):**  take a position make sure you've considered it from multiple points of view not just the  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:16:25):**  first one you've heard.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:16:27):**  This theme of data-driven decision making is a big one in ag right now at a time when  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:16:32):**  emotions are running hot and decisions are not always evidence-based. One especially  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:16:38):**  complicated area is ecosystem services and natural capital. Recently Murray took a hiking  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:16:44):**  trip to Switzerland with his family and this has shaped some of his views.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:16:48):**  Yeah we had a very enjoyable family holiday and part of that was we went for a hike through  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:16:54):**  the Swiss Alps. We got out of a train at the top of the path and walked down a valley through  
**[0:17:00-0:17:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:17:00):**  the forests and then down through the fields the meadows through a couple villages where  
**[0:17:07-0:17:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:17:07):**  there was milking cows with their bells ringing and it was an incredibly beautiful landscape  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:17:14):**  and an incredibly enjoyable afternoon but my wife and I spent a fair bit of it discussing  
**[0:17:19-0:17:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:17:19):**  about what was going on around us. The fact that there was a lot of these small farms  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:17:26):**  you know that the houses were in the villages and the barns for the cows were in the back  
**[0:17:31-0:17:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:17:31):**  of the houses so the cows were actually coming through the village and it was a really interesting  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:17:39):**  place and it showed we did a bit of research and I discovered that you know most farms  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:17:44):**  in Switzerland are incredibly small like I believe the average is only 23 cows per farm  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:17:50):**  but they still are quite from what we could see they look like they were doing quite well  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:17:55):**  financially and apparently they paid quite a bit of money to provide ecosystems and social  
**[0:18:02-0:18:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:18:02):**  outcomes so that the farms are still occupied and they get paid not to spray the flowers  
**[0:18:09-0:18:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:18:09):**  out of the meadows and it was a really interesting experience because it showed that there are  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:18:17):**  successful models out there. The society has chosen they want people to be living in the  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:18:23):**  country areas and they want them to manage that countryside so it's pretty and not only  
**[0:18:29-0:18:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:18:29):**  pretty but it's providing environmental services like protecting the wildlife and the flowers  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:18:37):**  and the trees and all that sort of stuff and here in Australia we've got a very different  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:18:42):**  culture and I'm not suggesting that we're about to do that we should go down the road  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:18:48):**  of getting direct payment to manage ecosystems but it does sort of temper the argument that  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:18:55):**  there aren't people out there that aren't successfully doing it you know it can be done  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:19:00):**  and it can be done very well.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:19:02):**  This is a complex issue for sure and there aren't easy answers or solutions. One thing  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:19:07):**  that we believe can help is maybe not surprisingly technology because with new technology comes  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:19:13):**  new business models and the ability to break trade-offs so I wanted to ask Murray about  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:19:18):**  the tech that he's using how he's using data to make decisions and how it's changed over  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:19:23):**  time.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:19:24):**  Yeah we've been a big user of technology I like my gadgets I must admit and so we've  
**[0:19:32-0:19:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:19:32):**  been keeping electronic records of what we do on the farm since 1997 which has been for  
**[0:19:40-0:19:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:19:40):**  the first 10 years we sort of wondered why I was doing it but it's given us a massive  
**[0:19:47-0:19:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:19:47):**  database that we can go in and have a look at and take a long-term view of what different  
**[0:19:55-0:20:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:19:55):**  practices give us financially as well as agronomically which has been it's the value of big data  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:20:03):**  if you haven't got that data set you can't find the information and building up the data  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:20:08):**  set was hard work but as we go forward it's been a really really useful tool and it's  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:20:13):**  been to make some of those more difficult decisions it's been very valuable because  
**[0:20:18-0:20:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:20:18):**  we can look in and go every paddock on our farm I've done a gross margin of for 15 years  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:20:26):**  so I can tell you how much money we've made off that paddock in the last 15 years profit  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:20:32):**  and you know so that's given us the ability to pick out some of our paddocks that are  
**[0:20:37-0:20:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:20:37):**  lower performers and go okay we're probably better off turning these into pastures long-term  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:20:43):**  pastures because they are too high risk because they're actually the thing that actually knocks  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:20:49):**  the profitability of those paddocks is that they get too wet that's not the dry because  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:20:54):**  in dry years every paddock gets hammered but in the wet years the paddocks that get really  
**[0:20:59-0:21:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:20:59):**  really wet also get hammered so we've sort of taken that strategic decision because we've  
**[0:21:06-0:21:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:21:06):**  got the data to back it up it gives us a lot more confidence to make the decision to change  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:21:13):**  Murray says that having all these data has allowed him to ask and answer questions that  
**[0:21:17-0:21:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:21:17):**  he didn't even know he had the ability to go in and ask questions and find out information  
**[0:21:24-0:21:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:21:24):**  is really really quite valuable and when we started I didn't think I'd be wanting to know  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:21:32):**  all sorts of things you know you sort of you don't know what you want to ask until you've  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:21:37):**  got the database and you realize you can ask the question is there an example of something  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:21:42):**  like that where you never would have imagined asking that of the data and now you've found  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:21:46):**  it useful to have things like just sitting down and working out say how much fertilizer  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:21:51):**  we've put in and taken out over the last 20 something years if I had to do it manually  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:21:57):**  I wouldn't take the time whereas because I've got the database I can actually do it in about  
**[0:22:04-0:22:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:22:04):**  30 seconds wow that's I feel like that's everyone's dream now is they want a system that they  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:22:11):**  like that does analytics but they also want uploading of the records for the past 20 years  
**[0:22:16-0:22:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:22:16):**  and no one unfortunately gets that unless someone enters in all those back of the envelope  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:22:20):**  calculations somewhere exactly yeah exactly and like I wouldn't like to be start trying  
**[0:22:25-0:22:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:22:25):**  to start where I am get to where I am now starting from scratch it's it's really difficult  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:22:33):**  to you know it just takes time there's no other way you can do it really another technology  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:22:39):**  that Murray has used with some pretty great results is variable rate so we've been using  
**[0:22:44-0:22:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:22:44):**  things like auto steer and yield mapping for a long time and about five or six years ago  
**[0:22:51-0:23:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:22:51):**  we actually got into pH mapping and we've we now do variable rate line which has been  
**[0:23:00-0:23:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:23:00):**  a big win-win for us because it's helped reduce our costs and we've gotten a better outcome  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:23:07):**  because we'd have places where traditionally we just put say two ton of lime per hectare  
**[0:23:12-0:23:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:23:12):**  every so many years and now with the testing we can find spots that actually need four  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:23:19):**  tonne to the hectare so if we put the two tonne on it still was going to have issues  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:23:25):**  and at the same time there was other areas that maybe only needed one tonne or half a  
**[0:23:30-0:23:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:23:30):**  tonne so we've been able to reduce our overall consumption of lime but get a much better  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:23:38):**  outcome and we're seeing that flow through then with the yield maps we're seeing a lot  
**[0:23:42-0:23:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:23:42):**  more evenness and the other thing that we're seeing out of it is where the really really  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:23:48):**  acid patches in the paddocks were tended to be where we'd have issues with weeds because  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:23:54):**  weeds often tend to be slightly more acid tolerant than the crops we were trying to  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:24:00):**  grow so it's been also an integrated weed management technique which we weren't at all  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:24:04):**  expecting but it was a great outcome.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:24:07):**  A positive example of unintended consequences.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:24:14):**  Murray has also looked at software to help him and his team manage tasks and keep a shared  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:24:19):**  to-do list of the jobs that need to get done.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:24:22):**  We certainly use a number of apps we're just using a new one now.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:24:26):**  I've got several people work for me and we have a management app that lets any of us  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:24:33):**  put on tasks they see that need to do and if I'm not on the farm I can actually just  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:24:39):**  look up my phone and see what's been done and what hasn't been done and so that's been  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:24:43):**  a real help to us to improve our efficiency and it lets me not be on the farm quite as  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:24:50):**  much as I used to be which is also helpful so that's been a winner.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:24:56):**  In looking at so many different technologies including apps Murray has some advice for  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:25:00):**  ag tech companies that are developing or trying to develop new tools for farmers.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:25:06):**  We've probably wasted a bit of money and time trying stuff over the years but I think one  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:25:12):**  of the things I've worked out is that if you've got a problem the technology is probably going  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:25:19):**  to be a lot more useful to you if the technology that's providing a solution is going to be  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:25:25):**  a lot more useful to us.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:25:27):**  It's one of the things I see a lot in technology is that in people trying to sell software  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:25:33):**  or apps they're trying to sell solutions to problems that might not even really exist.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:25:39):**  I think if I could give a message to software developers is to actually go out and find  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:25:46):**  the issue and work out how to fix that first and really get that working really well and  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:25:52):**  then move on then.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:25:54):**  Another thing that he's come to appreciate is the importance of simplicity.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:25:59):**  One thing I found is because I spent about six months trying to find something that was  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:26:05):**  workable because a lot of the programs that are made for city-based businesses have a  
**[0:26:12-0:26:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:26:12):**  degree of complexity, some of them are quite complex and difficult to use for, you know,  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:26:19):**  and I didn't want my staff having to sort of be afraid to use it because they were worried  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:26:25):**  they would stuff something up or they were higher cost or yeah they just weren't really  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:26:31):**  working that well for us because they don't need to be as complex because we're not shifting  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:26:36):**  lots of data around and that sort of thing.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:26:39):**  So yeah I reckon there's probably a market in the Ag sector for more of those task sharing  
**[0:26:46-0:26:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:26:46):**  software that is simple to use but has the ability to get more complex, to add complexity  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:26:53):**  to it if you need it.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:26:54):**  Great, well we'll have to get you more involved in the Ag Tech space.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:26:58):**  I know there are a lot of startups that would really benefit from your knowledge and your  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:27:02):**  open mind and your approach to start with problems and find solutions so I think there's  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:27:07):**  a big opportunity there.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:27:08):**  I guess I'll, if it's alright with you, I'll share your Twitter handle as a place for people  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:27:12):**  to look or follow or find more out about you.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:27:16):**  Is there anywhere else that they should look to other than the videos that I'm sure they'll  
**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:27:19):**  Google to hear you criticising sheep?  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:27:22):**  Anywhere else they should look to find you?  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:27:24):**  Yeah, you can also follow into our business on Facebook at Shoals Farming.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:27:29):**  We probably don't update it quite as much as we should but we like to share with some  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:27:33):**  of the interesting stuff we're doing.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=449713#t=0:27:35):**  Yeah, great, I will include a link to that as well in the show notes.

    ### Agtech - So What?  (2019-02-25)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly changing  the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting started.  But there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between Ag and  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:00:35):**  AgTech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring you the  story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where Ag and Tech  meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Welcome to our latest episode of the AgTech  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:01:00):**  So What podcast. This week's guest is Matt Rosener coming to us from Western Australia.  When we recorded this episode, we had a bit of trouble with the recording conditions.  So it's a bit hard to hear Matt in the beginning, but please stick with it. We thought the conversation  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:01:14):**  was still worthwhile to bring to you and the recording conditions do get better after the  first couple minutes. So please hang in there. I loved chatting with Matt because he is such  a good example and the product that he's talking about is such a good example of how innovation  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:01:29):**  in agriculture can come from all different areas and can be brought to market by all  different kinds of businesses. So Matt talks about the Marshall Multispread product, which  is quite famous in Australia. He also talks about the evolution of that product, some  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:01:44):**  of the software that they're building, and more broadly, how the AgTech space is evolving.  What's the future of data, of standards, and even of agronomy itself. Really enjoyed this  episode with Matt and I hope you do too. Matt Rosener, welcome to the podcast. Thanks  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:01:59):**  so much for joining me. Thanks for having me, Sarah.  So I wanted to start with, like I usually do, a bit of your background. Tell me how  you got to where you are today, what is currently in your repertoire of various plays which  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:02:19):**  I've seen in the Ag and AgTech space.  Okay, so I studied mechanical engineering, being from an engineering background that  made sense to me. I finished up my studies in the 90s and that's when I joined the family  
**[0:02:41-0:02:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:02:41):**  business. So that's Rosen Proprietary Limited. So synonymous in Australian agriculture with  the Marshall multi-spread fertilizer spread of ground. So the family company was started  by my great-grandfather in 1900. They started off as a blacksmith business and that grew  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:03:05):**  over the years. In the 1960s they started building the Marshall range of fertilizer  spreaders. So when I came into the business in the mid 90s that was sort of the dawn of  precision farming. It was when GPS was really starting to take off and the whole proposition  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:03:28):**  of variable rate was starting to get some early traction in the market. So my role in  the business is on the technical director of Rosen Proprietary Limited. So my role stretches  from engineering and design through to product testing through to some marketing as well.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:03:52):**  Sounds like quite a few hats to wear. Is it still very much a family business? Are there  other family members involved with you?  Yes, so the company is still family owned. My father is the managing director. He's still  
**[0:04:03-0:04:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:04:03):**  involved in the business and my brother Mark is also in the business as well.  It's interesting the kind of succession gets talked about a lot in farming, right, for  farming properties. I imagine some of the both issues and opportunities are the same  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:04:21):**  in a technology or other business. Do you see any parallels or big differences between  the succession conversation in farming and in business or in tech?  I definitely think it is very similar between the family farm as opposed to a manufacturing  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:04:41):**  or a technology business. The same questions that need to be asked and the same sort of  careful planning needs to be applied.  Yeah, makes sense. When you went to uni and studied mechanical engineering, did you always  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:04:54):**  know that you would come work in the business or did you ever have a thought of going off  and doing something else?  I think initially I had thought that I would do something else before coming back to the  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:05:11):**  family business but in the mid 90s the business was really starting to grow quite rapidly  mainly because of the lime and gypsum spreading that was starting to gain popularity for soil  amelioration. At the time it was pretty much a no brain decision that needed to be made  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:05:36):**  to come back and help out.  How is it working with your family? I had a guest on recently and she was talking about  working in the family business and how it's easy and how they separated things. I know  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:05:51):**  that I love my parents, I'm really close with them but I would struggle to work with them.  Do you ever find it challenging?  It is a challenge. I think communication is the key thing and also trying to delineate  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:06:06):**  like your family life to your business life is pretty, whilst it's challenging it really  needs to be done.  I can imagine it's easy to work all the time or talk about work all the time.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:06:21):**  That can take over and you just really need to be mindful that on the weekends if you're  catching up with your family that work should be left at work.  Probably easier said than done. Tell me and for those listening that might not be familiar  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:06:37):**  about the spreader and the story or history of the Marshall spreader.  The Marshall brand was first introduced in the 1960s. In the early 1980s we built the  Marshall Mouldy spread. The Marshall Mouldy spread was at the time the first Australian  
**[0:06:58-0:07:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:06:58):**  made all-purpose machine. I just touched on lime and gypsum as being key products that  really took off in the in the 90s. The Mouldy spread was the first machine that could do  both lime and gypsum along with your traditional granulated fertilizers.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:07:19):**  The popularity grew quite rapidly. In fact we've just finished our 10,000th unit so we  built 10,000 since the 1980s which is quite an achievement we think.  We would have a significant share of the Australian market that's built up during that time.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:07:48):**  How have we stayed relevant? We spent a lot of time trying to keep in touch with our customer  base understanding how their needs are changing and things like controlled traffic and variable  rate have really fundamentally changed what the Mouldy spread does look like now.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:08:11):**  Modern spreaders are variable rate ready. It's got load cells to accurately measure  calibration so no product is wasted and to improve efficiency. They've physically got  larger with larger hopper capacities. We really concentrate on being in control of our user  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:08:36):**  experience as well so making sure that we've got good support services for machines in  the field, a good network of dealers and spare parts backup as well.  One of the things that gets talked about in AG is the difference between point solutions  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:08:56):**  and platforms. The share has lots of different functionality and is flexible and like you  said taking on new farming systems but in some ways you guys have stuck to a solution  made it really simple, really good support, really focused on one core area of expertise.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:09:14):**  Have you ever been tempted to build out more of a platform? Do customers ask you to expand  more horizontally than you've wanted to and have you made that decision?  We do get a lot of requests for customization. In some cases it can be done. In others it  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:09:34):**  just doesn't make commercial sense to spend a lot of time and effort in building a particular  machine that might only have one application. I think in farming simplicity is very important  and we've tried and we continue to do so to build really simple systems that are easily  
**[0:09:58-0:10:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:09:58):**  maintained and have a long service life as well. I think one of the big challenges for  farmers today is just the cost of capital equipment. It's continually rising and they're  spending large amounts of money on machinery that's only used for two or three months of  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:10:22):**  the year and then it's put in the shed. We really concentrate on building something simple,  easy to maintain that will last multiple seasons and have a long service life.  That makes total sense. Do you have an example of a feature that you thought about building  
**[0:10:44-0:10:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:10:44):**  that you guys didn't build or a path you could have gone down that you didn't go down?  In the early 2000s we looked at combining a fertilizer spreader with a chaser bin in  one unit and we built some prototypes and put them in the field but they weren't really  
**[0:11:08-0:11:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:11:08):**  successful. We also did look at using our core technology for a couple of mining applications  as well but that wasn't successful either.  How did you imagine it's hard when you've taken the time to build out a prototype and  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:11:32):**  you tried to go with the chaser bins as well and then it didn't work. Was it really obvious  that it didn't work or was there a bit of loss aversion where you wanted to keep going  down that path and hoped it would work or was it easy to let go?  
**[0:11:48-0:11:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:11:48):**  As an engineer it's always difficult to let go of your ideas. They become a bit like babies  I suppose, like children. There's also inventor syndrome as well where you obviously think  that what you're building is going to rule the world. It wasn't a difficult decision  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:12:15):**  with those two projects to walk away from because commercially you could see that they  weren't going to make sense. I had such a small share of the market you've got a way  up spending a lot of time thinking about a small share of your market rather than the  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:12:35):**  other 97% that are changing rapidly.  I wanted to ask about the changes you mentioned, control traffic before. Tell me more about  how the market has fragmented, maybe not be the right word, in terms of who's adopting  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:12:55):**  different kinds of practices that are maybe making them more suited to use new technologies  versus others who haven't changed practices and how do you as a supplier think about your  market? Have you started to segment more readily? Have you started to help people adopt different  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:13:12):**  practices so that they're more ready for the technology, do that market education piece?  How has that impacted the business?  I do see that the market is segmenting to a degree. You've got your early adopters and  
**[0:13:28-0:13:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:13:28):**  they've probably got the latest control systems and control traffic, so three metre wheel  spacings, load cells, the fully optioned up machine and they've probably been, the last  25 years there's been a certain group of early adopters. Then there's a whole lot of growers  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:13:57):**  that can see the benefits in doing something like variable rate or control traffic but  they're a bit scared to take the steps. I think they're concerned by having the support  from OEMs, equipment suppliers and potentially they're agronomists as well. It does take  
**[0:14:18-0:14:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:14:18):**  a bit of education to move people to the new practices and in some respects there are some  growers that are quite happy just to stick with a simple machine and they don't have  the need to do variable rate. Perhaps their soils aren't variable enough to justify the  
**[0:14:41-0:14:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:14:41):**  investment or that they're on top of their management and their costs.  Really interesting. I think that you hit on the right point that I hear a lot around fear  and that lack of support. Just not wanting to go on the journey alone and if I get stuck  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:15:00):**  like who am I going to call and what does that full ecosystem look like and if things  don't work out or if I have questions.  Yep.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:15:09):**  I'm curious, you guys work across industries as I understand it, a lot in broadacre but  livestock and in vineyards as well. Do you see differences in how each of those industries  are changing in terms of both practices and technology?  
**[0:15:27-0:15:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:15:27):**  There's one overarching thing that's happening across all the industries and that's just  the need to be competitive. They've got to get higher yields or be in control of their  costs and that's happening across agriculture, all the subsets of agriculture. The days of  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:15:53):**  being able to put out fertilizer or spray and know that you're going to get a return,  they've disappeared.  Is that pretty true? It sounds like in all the industries are there nuances that have  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:16:08):**  impacted technology adoption? I guess one thing that's interesting to me that we talk  to entrepreneurs about is based on the market size or commodity value, you might pick different  markets. If you have a technology that could be applied to a bunch of different industries,  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:16:22):**  you might use market size as a reason to pick one over the other. Some industries get more  technology than others. I think even if the problems are the same in all the different  industries.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:16:38):**  I think the broadacre and large livestock operations operate on a smaller margin. The  lower value crops probably need technology that's got all the features but it's at a  lower cost point. Something like viticulture, horticulture, market gardening, higher value  
**[0:17:07-0:17:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:17:07):**  crops, they may be prepared to pay a little bit more. They can immediately see the benefits  of adopting a technology. It's maybe because those sort of enterprises are much smaller  in scale, it's immediately obvious to them how a certain technology would improve their  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:17:31):**  bottom line.  I think also if you think about a broadacre or larger livestock, it might take a few seasons  for them to actually realise the value in going to controlled traffic or variable rate  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:17:51):**  because it's so heavily dependent on the climate in Australia.  I was having that conversation with someone today around how the visibility of the industry  improvement matters a lot and you can't always control the factors around that. You might  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:18:06):**  do something that worked super well but the other conditions meant that you didn't know  and so then you don't stick with it. It actually would have been really beneficial. I think  that will improve with more sensors and data etc. but right now it's hard to isolate the  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:18:24):**  experiment and know what worked and what didn't.  The digital space has obviously grown a ton. Tell me about your guys' play in that space  and the background story of the app and what you're now doing on the digital side.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:18:43):**  We decided a few years ago that we would build a mobile app for sending out calibration data  to our client base. Previously, the calibration data was all in a manual. It was a fairly  static thing so different products would change, fertilisers would change and manuals weren't  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:19:11):**  updated. What we decided to do was to put all that information in a really flexible  iOS and Android app and put that out to the market. We got a really good response. It  was quite surprising because you would go to a field day and a lot of the clients would  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:19:30):**  come up and say I've got your Marshall app on my phone now. I don't need to look at my  manual. I can be in the field and set my machine up exactly how I need it. The calibration  is quite accurate. We then thought mobile is moving quickly. Sensors are becoming cheaper  
**[0:19:53-0:20:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:19:53):**  as is hardware. Let's see if we can build a controller app to run on an iPad that would  make it easier to do variable rate. This was about 2016. Immediately there was a lot of  uptake of that product. Compared to a Tier 1 OEM, we were able to do a variable rate  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:20:18):**  on a fertiliser spreader for half the cost. Immediately there was a lot of interest in  it. At that time, Precision Agronomics Australia were building our hardware. They're an Air  Esperance based company we were working with to do hardware development. Earlier this year  
**[0:20:41-0:20:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:20:41):**  in 2018, Precision Agronomics was purchased by Roseness. As an equipment manufacturer,  we see that we're still going to be building products into the future. The importance of  all the services and the data ecosystems that exist around the product are going to really  
**[0:21:06-0:21:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:21:06):**  increase. It's this whole idea of managing the user experience from start to finish.  As part of that acquisition, Precision Agronomics and Roseness have formed the I4M brand. The  whole idea of I4M is to take what each company was previously doing and to form a single  
**[0:21:33-0:21:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:21:33):**  brand that aims to have really flexible and open systems that are cost effective and independent  from the larger OEMs. They can work with any tractor. It's really streamlined data transfer.  No nasty unlock codes and subscription fees. That's in a bit of a nutshell of where we're  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:21:58):**  moving in the digital space.  Right. Maybe I'm being an idiot here. What does I4M stand for or what does it mean?  It means Internet for Machines. That's how the name came about. Our whole plan is to  
**[0:22:17-0:22:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:22:17):**  be able to have equipment talking back to the Internet to transfer and receive operational  data, prescription maps as applied data.  When you guys started down the path of building this app, how did you find doing more on the  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:22:39):**  software side and that direct user interface? It's not necessarily the same skill set or  capabilities as what core business was. How did you find entering in the software world  and managing that space?  
**[0:22:53-0:23:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:22:53):**  Look, it was a very steep learning curve. At times, it has been quite difficult. I think  in the digital realm, specification documents like road maps, etc., are really important,  particularly when you're a company that's used to dealing with things that are tangible  
**[0:23:22-0:23:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:23:22):**  and physical. It's a bit abstract to then have your team start thinking about the software  and code and the value is in the code, not something that's physically able to be touched,  etc.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:23:40):**  Yeah, it's really different too from that kind of visibility of results. We made a bunch  of progress today. We got these functions and it's like, well, let me see it. It's like,  well, you can't.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:23:52):**  Yeah. Yeah.  So, I'm curious about the kind of variable rate space in terms of you guys get, so as  I understand it, you can get different maps from different providers, like third-party  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:24:06):**  providers. Do you see that space becoming more standardized? I imagine that kind of  translation into a shape file or whatever is still a bit piece by piece. Do you see  it becoming more standardized? Who's going to, if anyone, kind of own that space or do  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:24:22):**  that in a more standardized way or how do you see that evolving?  I think that the shape file format is a proxy at the moment for a standard. Most systems  can interpret a shape file. My thoughts are that eventually the industry is going to have  
**[0:24:45-0:24:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:24:45):**  to embrace data exchange and that perhaps the shape file will be that default format.  I think one of the biggest challenges at the moment with moving prescription maps around  is the whole USB transfer and having to have directories set up properly on USB drives.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:25:12):**  That is really limiting the use of prescription maps. The way our system works is that there's  a website that the user can create their own username and password for. No lock codes and  subscription costs. You buy the hardware, you get access to the website. Then it's as  
**[0:25:35-0:25:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:25:35):**  simple as just dropping a shapefile onto the server and then syncing it to your device.  It's a very simple process. I feel that the larger OEMs do make it a little bit too difficult  for most growers to get their head around the transfer and file formats etc.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:26:05):**  Just so I understand, is the challenge that you need a bit of a technical skill set to  manage the process and exchange that? You mentioned the codes and access so that's definitely  one that you need to change. Is it a technical issue or a skills issue or just help me understand  
**[0:26:24-0:26:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:26:24):**  more easily? I think it's more of a skills issue and time issue. Technically it's definitely  a lot easier now than what it has been. It's just having the grower to have the skills  to transfer the files correctly and then them having the time. If you're a busy seeding  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:26:48):**  and agronomist sends you a new map, you don't want to spend, you want to minimize the amount  of time that you're spending transferring files. You don't want to have to go back to  the office, pick up a USB stick, take it out to the machine, load the map. That's just  
**[0:27:03-0:27:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:27:03):**  too time consuming. Whereas with our system you can put a file on the server and it's  immediately synced to the device. Do you see, you mentioned the kind of technical  capabilities, do you see the role of agronomists or service providers more broadly I guess  
**[0:27:23-0:27:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:27:23):**  changing to be more technical and tech savvy and including more of those capabilities?  Most definitely. Agronomists and service providers need to be more tech savvy. If they don't  they're not going to be relevant in five to ten years. They have to have that strong technical  
**[0:27:48-0:28:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:27:48):**  background in the digital space. I think one of the challenges that the industry faces  is the fact that agronomist service providers are needing to learn more technically at a  time when all the platforms they use are marching along rapidly and it's hard to keep up for  
**[0:28:11-0:28:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:28:11):**  them. We also see the fact that if you're using a system for let's say yield data processing  for instance, you might only use that for two months of the year so that at every harvest  you've got the advisors have to relearn those tools.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:28:33):**  Yeah and what do you think the solution is there? Where does this education come from?  Is it just kind of those that invest in learning it and build the capabilities and excel in  a space will stay ahead and will continue to exist or do you see a more systemic intervention  
**[0:28:52-0:28:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:28:52):**  to build some of these skills?  I think artificial intelligence will be when that arrives that'll help everyone out but  until we get to that point where say yield data processing is automated, prescription  
**[0:29:12-0:29:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:29:12):**  map creation etc. There's huge promise there for the industry but before we can get there  we've got the whole standardization question that needs to be answered. You mentioned before  about is SHAPE file a standard format? The industry's got to sort out standardization.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:29:35):**  We need to learn how to deal with much larger data sets as well so until we can teach machines  to make decisions on agricultural systems that are inherently complex we really need  to have the standardization of the data sets so we can start teaching machines. We need  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:29:58):**  an agronomist to buy into that process because what works in one region of the country may  not work in other regions of the country so we need to have that sort of interaction with  agronomists to learn how they manage certain farming situations.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:30:16):**  It's interesting. Go ahead Matt.  Probably the fourth thing that needs to happen is trust. Growers are very suspicious of new  products that come out that promise a lot but don't deliver the value. So I think as  
**[0:30:37-0:30:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:30:37):**  service providers for instance precision agronomics business our goal is really to bring advisors  or the end users along with us so to educate them, make sure they see value in what we're  doing and to look a few years ahead and to be able to say we can't implement precision  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:31:06):**  farming in one season but how do we get to where we want to be in three years? I actually  see part of our business maybe in the future is that sort of planning steps of how to get  to the end goal.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:31:19):**  Yeah I think it's really interesting the kind of evolving role of agronomy and service provision.  It's not that it's going away and I think there's a lot of fear that oh when this technology  comes online you know we won't put agronomists and we'll replace them and I think your point  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:31:34):**  is a really good one. It's actually more that the skill set will change and evolve and almost  kind of vertically integrate like more of the process will be human plus technology  and covered by perhaps a single company than before but it's not that the human won't actually  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:31:50):**  be in the loop.  Yeah I agree with that. We won't be able to replace agronomists. Their expertise is very  valuable and they'll just evolve to do some other task.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:32:07):**  Speaking of replacing people, what do you see in the autonomy space more broadly for  equipment you know robots and swarm farms and that kind of end of the spectrum and then  also just you know retrofit solutions to maybe get rid of one person or one task. How do  
**[0:32:29-0:32:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:32:29):**  you see that space evolving?  I think there's a massive potential for a country like Australia to be leaders in the  adoption of autonomous equipment. I still see the whole, technically it's feasible now  
**[0:32:47-0:32:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:32:47):**  it can be done but there's this whole question of legality. If something does go wrong who's  responsible for it? I don't think the framework for dealing with autonomous vehicles in general,  the legal framework has been well thought through yet. It's a bit of those classic technologies  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:33:15):**  moving faster than what governments are to regulate these industries.  It's interesting right like you wonder whether take Uber for an example like they didn't  wait until the policy around you know various things kind of got they just went ahead foolishly  
**[0:33:32-0:33:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:33:32):**  and I think drones are an interesting example like you have the line of sight regulations  but if it's proving valuable enough you know people are happy to fly them around a corner  over a hill or whatever so I wonder about the like will we will technology just actually  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:33:45):**  practically get ahead and be adopted before regulations actually change or will it become  a barrier that has to change before these solutions are available?  My thoughts are that the industry will just move. They just can't wait for regulators  
**[0:34:04-0:34:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:34:04):**  to sort out how we deal with the localities of tractor driving onto a public road, those  sorts of things. I think also there's a certain degree of control that may be lost by the  large OEMs that may also slow things down. For instance aftermarket steering kits that  
**[0:34:35-0:34:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:34:35):**  get put on brand new tractors, how do warranties work then, who's responsible for the service  and to a greater extent who has the skill set to service an autonomous tractor because  it's quite a niche thing that's got to be mechanically minded, electrically minded and  
**[0:34:59-0:35:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:34:59):**  also have some sort of software bent as well and if anything the precision ag industry  currently is really struggling for the staff that have those skill sets.  Yeah I totally agree. I wonder where that will come from like I think the poll will  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:35:19):**  be great therefore the wages will be good and therefore people will study it or people  figure out how to teach it. I wonder too if it will be something that comes through bank  colleges or kind of the traditional pathways or is that something that people will learn  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:35:32):**  more in a trade school type sense or even online or like kind of what is the supply  chain almost look like for that skill set because I could imagine it being really different  than the current one.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:35:45):**  Yeah that is very true. In my mind it's a tertiary level thing but there's got to be  a certain degree of practicality in it as well. Like I see this on a almost a daily  basis where we've got staff that are learning as we go and you can do lots of training but  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:36:09):**  you really need that hands-on experience to connect it all together.  Yeah that's right. It's interesting there's been a bit of talk of like virtual reality  and augmented reality to do some of this training. Like would you have someone remote and then  
**[0:36:24-0:36:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:36:24):**  just have augmented reality kind of pull up the you know equipment in the paddock and  send it back to a technician that's sitting in a city or whatever and help walk through  it and diagnose it. Do you do you give kind of weight to any of those types of solutions?  
**[0:36:39-0:36:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:36:39):**  Look I think it's going to be a necessity that those solutions evolve. We are looking  at a really simple way of being able to log into a controller and just to get back some  key calibration data to help over the phone for both our technicians and our clients.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:37:04):**  So that is high on our development road roadmap at the moment.  Interesting I wanted to ask about you guys obviously have lots of technical capabilities  you do your own manufacturing from the standards business perspective and obviously software  
**[0:37:21-0:37:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:37:21):**  as well. Do you like now that there's this whole ag tech kind of scene developing and  more startups and new entrants kind of building technology and thinking about solving these  problems from different perspectives. Do you guys think about partnering with some of these  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:37:34):**  new entrants? Do you kind of give credit to any of the solutions you're seeing or is it  still more like you know do it ourselves because we have the capabilities and the expertise?  We do keep a close eye on what's happening and we're definitely open to collaborate with  
**[0:37:52-0:38:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:37:52):**  new players in the market but we do have a core base that has the experience of the ag  space so we can quickly build new products and get them to market but at the same time  you have to make a decision whether it's that more economically viable to partner with someone  
**[0:38:20-0:38:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:38:20):**  or build it yourself and we have quite a strict regime of working out the answer to that question.  Are there any examples of either opportunity areas or specific companies that you're looking  at or that you think the kind of startup world is doing a good job of addressing and that  
**[0:38:38-0:38:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:38:38):**  you're keeping close watch on? So a good example is we've got a distribution agreement through  a UK based company, it's an agronomy platform. They came to us and said we need some hardware  built and we'd like to be able to interface with your hardware using APIs so that was  
**[0:39:03-0:39:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:39:03):**  a partnership that we formally finalised in August this year. So that's a good example  of us having the ability to build our own cloud-based platform for handling data but  understand it's probably not really our strength so let's partner with a third party to do  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:39:27):**  something together. Definitely keeping an eye on things like drones and any sense of  technology is something that's interesting to us. We've got a company here in Perth that  we work quite closely with for provision of some drone-based services that had some stratus  
**[0:39:47-0:39:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:39:47):**  imagery, you might be aware of them. Yeah cool, it's interesting in some ways there  obviously are potential collaborations and really good alignment and looking to solve  similar problems for similar customers between say a business like Rosner that's been around  
**[0:40:03-0:40:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:40:03):**  for a long time and a startup that's just kind of starting. I wonder do you see tension  despite that alignment, tension in the kind of venture capital type of funding models  and some of the incentives or business models of these new startups that maybe make it incompatible  
**[0:40:21-0:40:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:40:21):**  or are there opportunities there? How do you see that space? Yeah look that is a bit of  a challenge having an older company that's well established. Any sort of venture capital  company is going to be looking at us thinking why are these guys trying to play in this  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:40:44):**  market that's just emerging or the other way they might think is well they've got some  money behind them might be a larger play here. So there's definitely something that we look  at a case to case basis and I think it just comes comes back to trust again. Yeah that  
**[0:41:08-0:41:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:41:08):**  makes sense I can imagine it from the other side too like if they're saying you know what's  this company that's been around a long time and playing in this new space and you're like  what are these new people playing in this space that we've been in for so long? Yeah  
**[0:41:24-0:41:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:41:24):**  and to be fair to most VC guys they particularly in this is from a West Australian perspective  they're used to dealing in mining like agriculture is something that's yeah they're not they're  not au fait with how the market works. Yeah that's definitely something we've seen in  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:41:46):**  our work that there's a kind of getting up to speed on the space process and you know  maybe even more complicated by the fact like we were talking about before that each industry  is different you know how it works in broadacre would be different than vineyards would be  
**[0:41:59-0:42:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:41:59):**  different than livestock etc. So it's you know pretty complex but if you stick with  it there are obviously as I'm sure you believe as well big opportunities. Yep. So tell me  about where you see I guess kind of a couple part question where you see yourself and where  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:42:20):**  you see the precision ag space in let's call it 10 years what do you think it is happening  what's different from from today that will be happening then? I think in 10 years time  there's going to be huge sensor networks that are operating across farms in all different  
**[0:42:41-0:42:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:42:41):**  industries collecting data in real time that's being sent to cloud-based systems that have  some degree of artificial intelligence to help growers make better decisions. I hope  that we see better system interoperability so the large players all talking to each other  
**[0:43:02-0:43:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:43:02):**  I'd like to see that happen whether it does or not we won't really know until the future  comes. I like to think that support becomes a lot easier to deliver and less of a challenge  and that what will drive that is better skills in the industry as well. It would be great  
**[0:43:34-0:43:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:43:34):**  to see young people seeing precision agriculture as a great career to get involved in like  one of those sort of cool careers that they know that they're going to be able to work  in the industry for the next 40 years and always be challenged. Yeah I think that those  
**[0:44:00-0:44:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:44:00):**  are common things I'm curious on the sensors and the kind of rollout of the networks who  do you think's behind that like in this vision you've created is it a bunch of different  companies are they startups are they existing providers like how does that happen? I think  
**[0:44:15-0:44:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:44:15):**  we're going to see initially there'll be quite innovative sensors that come on the market  but I see that they'll probably start to get gobbled up by the bigger players if they can  see as soon as they see some value then they're going to want to acquire those smaller companies.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:44:37):**  The more complicated sensors probably the larger companies are going to start building  because they obviously cost quite a lot to develop but it may not be your traditional  manufacturing companies or OEMs that start building the sensors it might actually come  
**[0:44:58-0:45:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:44:58):**  the other way. So companies that have cloud-based systems and they want to get a certain piece  of data to add value to their system they actually might start building sensors. I think  that's a big possibility. I mean these days with sensor technology it's all almost like  
**[0:45:19-0:45:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:45:19):**  a commodity and it's becoming much easier to develop a particular type of sensor for  a particular system. Yeah we're definitely seeing that I think the my sense is that space  will get commoditized and there'll be some winners in the process and acquisitions as  
**[0:45:37-0:45:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:45:37):**  you said and some wins but my guess is that's not the space you you probably want to be  in. And how about yourself Matt where will you be in in 10 years what will your day-to-day  look like? Look I'm hoping in 10 years time that we've got the I4M brand is really well  
**[0:45:56-0:46:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:45:56):**  established and that we are a business that continues to evolve and stay true to our sort  of core values. Like I often say that it would be amazing if in 50 years time Precision Agronomics  is known as a business that's well trusted, high level of customer satisfaction, being  
**[0:46:22-0:46:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:46:22):**  able to deliver value and that essentially it's got a good name in the market in the  same way that the Marshall Mouldy spread brand has. As far as where where do I see myself  fit in I'll be hoping that I can pass on a lot of my knowledge and educate the younger  
**[0:46:42-0:46:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:46:42):**  generation to to be able to use the use the new tools but also use a lot of that knowledge  it has that I've been able to build up over the years. I know you said you have some kids  I think they're probably too young to be fully working in the business in even 10 years but  
**[0:47:03-0:47:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:47:03):**  have they shown any inclination or do you have aspirations for them to join the business  one day as well? Look it would be a great story if you could say that it was the fifth  generation involved in the family company. I think that if I look at say the big European  
**[0:47:23-0:47:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:47:23):**  family companies they've always continued to succeed because they push the next generation  to learn more and I think that's probably the way that I would approach it. I want my  children to go and do something different learn from other industries and then bring  
**[0:47:40-0:47:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:47:40):**  that skillset back. I think that's very important. Yeah and I mean I guess it's consistent with  what we said before around the kind of different skills that we'll need in the future that  it might be tech skills you know it might be yeah very different kinds of capabilities  
**[0:47:56-0:48:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:47:56):**  than folks have today so that that makes a lot of sense and probably they won't always  be learned in the current business or in this industry right it might have to come from  other experiences or other places. Yep yep. Well very cool Matt I really appreciate you  
**[0:48:13-0:48:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:48:13):**  coming on the podcast I think it's such an amazing story of what you guys have been able  to do and build and the brand that you do have and how modern the thinking is becoming  it's really cool from my perspective to talk to a company that's been around for so long  
**[0:48:27-0:48:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:48:27):**  but that is yet still on the kind of cutting edge of what's coming and I asked the question  about where it is where do you see things in 10 years often and even from people who  are working on the cutting edge of tech I get a yeah it'll probably look a bit the same  
**[0:48:40-0:48:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357327#t=0:48:40):**  as it does today so I commend the future forward-looking view and I think it's a sign of how you guys  have been able to kind of be successful this long and hopefully we'll continue to in the  future. Yeah thanks for having me I've enjoyed talking. No worries.

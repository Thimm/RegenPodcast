### Agtech - So What?  (2023-01-18)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Ag Tech So What, brought to you by Tenacious Ventures.  I'm Sarah Nolet.  A reminder, don't forget to stick around until the end of the show for some fresh insights  
**[0:00:12-0:00:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:00:12):**  on our fundraising out loud journey.  And make sure you check in with us on social media and visit our website in the show notes  for more info.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:00:19):**  Now onto the show.  When we think about the future of farming, one of our key convictions is that the future  leaders in production agriculture will be much more highly integrated into their products,  
**[0:00:29-0:00:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:00:29):**  supply chains, than they are today.  We think tech will be a big enabler of this, though the bigger motivator is the essential  economics of farm businesses.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:00:38):**  The goal of doing this is to remove our business from the volatile global market, right?  I'm not a price taker, I'm a price setter.  And that's where I feel that we can maintain a multi-generational healthy family business.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:00:54):**  So yeah, of course, that's a lot more work.  That's Michael Bosworth, a California rice farmer and the founder and CEO of Next Generation  Foods.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:01:03):**  Since he took over the farm years ago, Michael has set out to do things differently.  For the past 16 years, he's been marketing his rice and other locally grown foods through  his distribution company.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:01:13):**  And recently he launched True Origin Foods, his in-house rice brand.  And finally, he also owns and operates a co-packing company to help bring farm products to market.  I connected with Michael to discuss his outlook on the value and limitations of integrating  
**[0:01:28-0:01:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:01:28):**  farm operations with business further along the supply chain, and to dig into his perspectives  on consumer trends, climate pressures, and where tech solutions might most lucratively  serve his group of businesses and others like it going forward.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:01:43):**  This journey started for Michael quite early in his career.  When I was in college at UC Davis, I took an ag marketing class and one of our projects  was to track an agricultural product through the supply chain, figure out who's making  
**[0:01:58-0:02:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:01:58):**  money where.  And we were growing organic rice and it became apparent that there was opportunity to capture  more of that value stream.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:02:08):**  And so we started a brand and started marketing to food service customers, sushi restaurants,  universities, tech campuses, folks like that.  And it was very difficult to find distribution.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:02:20):**  And so I started a distribution business called Next Generation Foods to facilitate that growth  of that business.  And I had a lot of my customers saying, hey, this is great.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:02:30):**  I love knowing where my food comes from.  Can you find me dry beans?  Can you find me olive oil?  
**[0:02:35-0:02:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:02:35):**  I know you have a network of farmers in your area.  Tell me what else you can find.  If it works for us, why don't you carry it?  
**[0:02:43-0:02:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:02:43):**  And that'll make things more efficient for everybody to buy local.  And all that came out of a project in college?  Yeah, pretty much.  
**[0:02:51-0:03:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:02:51):**  It was kind of an inspiration.  I was doing that project and then I went to the local sushi restaurant and looked in the  kitchen and there was about 500 pounds of Calrose rice sitting on their shelves.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:03:02):**  And I said, okay, we might be able to make this thing work.  I guess a little bit about that demand from the customer side.  Are they excited about local?  
**[0:03:09-0:03:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:03:09):**  Are they excited about just knowing where it comes from?  Is it more about a kind of differentiated product in some ways?  What are those conversations like?  
**[0:03:17-0:03:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:03:17):**  Yeah.  So when I started in 2006, the focus was heavily into organic at that time.  And I've seen a shift over time to people just wanting a connection with the farm and  
**[0:03:29-0:03:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:03:29):**  understanding where it's coming from, who's growing it, what kind of farming practices  that they're doing on their farm, what kind of sustainability initiatives they have.  And so that's been a pretty interesting transition over time because that's allowed us to scale  
**[0:03:45-0:03:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:03:45):**  into other varieties more quickly without having to transition land into organic.  We still grow organic, but we also grow conventionally.  Tell me a little bit more about the farm and the rice operation side of things.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:03:57):**  Paint me a picture of it, and then we can double click on some of the strategies and  practices.  My family has been farming rice since the seventies.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:04:05):**  We've been farming organic rice since 1997, but primarily produce conventional rice.  But for decades, it's always been a focus to grow different varieties of rice to try  and capture premiums in the market, whether that's through traditional marketing and milling  
**[0:04:24-0:04:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:04:24):**  companies or more of a direct relationship.  So currently we grow Calrose, which is the most popular variety of rice in California.  It's in every sushi roll in America, essentially.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:04:36):**  Some higher end sushi restaurants are using a short grain variety, which we also grow.  We grow jasmine, we grow basmati, long grain, premium Calrose.  So yeah, quite a few different varieties.  
**[0:04:49-0:05:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:04:49):**  How different are the production systems for those different varieties?  They're very similar.  You might change how much fertilizer you're going to use, particularly for a basmati.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:05:00):**  It's a very low yielding variety, but it's extremely high quality.  That's our focus always is not just to grow something that's called basmati, but to grow  the best variety available.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:05:11):**  And it yields probably about 30% less than other basmati varieties out there, but it's  the only true basmati grown in the United States.  It elongates when it cooks.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:05:20):**  It has amazing aroma.  For that variety, we have to back off the fertilizer quite a bit.  Otherwise, the plant has just too much and you'll get blank kernels and sterilized kernels  
**[0:05:30-0:05:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:05:30):**  and the yield doesn't go well.  Is the supply chain downstream of you guys different for each of those different varieties?  I'm trying to imagine the range of different varieties you grow and then is it some varieties  
**[0:05:42-0:05:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:05:42):**  are for one particular customer?  Is it that low level of detail?  And if so, how does processing end up working?  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:05:49):**  What's the kind of mapping of different varieties to how they end up downstream into mouths  eventually?  Yeah.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:05:55):**  So for Calrose, we grow a fair amount of Calrose and that is traditionally marketed through  mills and marketing organizations.  So it's a homogenous product.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:06:05):**  There's no opportunity to differentiate.  There's no opportunity for a premium, a very little opportunity for a premium.  We have higher costs of doing business than large distributors do.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:06:16):**  I don't really deal with Calrose.  I do a little bit, but I don't deal with it a lot.  So that kind of leaves the farm and goes on about its way.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:06:24):**  We do organic Calrose.  So that's something that we would handle throughout the supply chain.  Any premium products that have an opportunity for differentiation, we handle those all the  
**[0:06:34-0:06:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:06:34):**  way through the supply chain.  Once they're harvested, they go to a dryer.  Then once they're ready to be milled, we will ship them to a mill where we can have them  
**[0:06:43-0:06:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:06:43):**  toll milled so we don't have to own a mill, which is fantastic.  And then we'll have them either packaged into our food service bags, which are 25 pound  bags.  
**[0:06:52-0:07:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:06:52):**  Sometimes we have them put in bulk totes, 2,000 pound totes.  We're going to put them under our True Origin Foods brand.  We'll just bring them to our packing facility in West Sacramento and pack them off in our  
**[0:07:02-0:07:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:07:02):**  two pound bags with our rotary pouch machine.  And then the food service product goes over to our cold storage warehouse at Next Generation  Foods and we deliver that directly to our customers.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:07:14):**  We work a lot with tech campuses in the Bay Area.  We work with universities, sports arenas, hospitals, things like that.  How have you thought about trade-offs between sort of simplicity and complexity versus,  
**[0:07:27-0:07:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:07:27):**  I imagine, economics and potentially environmental considerations as well?  I don't know.  We'll have to get into the environmental part of it.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:07:35):**  But the goal of doing this is to remove our business from the volatile global market.  I'm not a price taker.  I'm a price setter.  
**[0:07:45-0:08:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:07:45):**  And that's where I feel that we can maintain a multi-generational healthy family business.  So yeah, of course, it's a lot more work.  It took a long time to get where we are, but I believe in our vision and want to see it  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:08:00):**  through.  And we're definitely getting to the scale where it's really working and I'm excited  about the future.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:08:06):**  But yeah, can you expand on your environmental question?  I'm curious what the drivers are.  One lens would be purely economic premiums that can come from being a price setter.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:08:15):**  Another might be the downstream supply chain cares about some of the environmental credentials.  There might be around just climate resilience and volatility and water prices and availability.  Or it might be more around resilience, could be more around biodiversity.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:08:29):**  So everyone's got different drivers and there's always trade offs to consider.  Absolutely.  People are interested in buying local.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:08:38):**  So my rice goes from my farm to a mill 60 miles north and then goes from that mill to  West Sacramento, which is 100 miles away.  And then it goes to our customers that are less than a hundred miles away.  
**[0:08:51-0:09:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:08:51):**  So if you want jasmine rice, you're going to get it from Thailand.  You want basmati rice, you're getting it from India.  So there's a multitude of potential issues with that kind of a supply chain, environmental  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:09:03):**  impacts, less regulation in some of these countries, all the transportation costs and  impacts there.  And then, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:09:10):**  We have a great environmental story to tell with the way that we think about lowering  our inputs and using technology to create efficiencies and improve yield.  We do a lot of work with environmental organizations to create habitat for migratory waterfowl and  
**[0:09:25-0:09:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:09:25):**  shorebirds.  I think people are attracted to a lot of those different benefits of working with our company.  Yeah.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:09:32):**  I imagine that with a unique model that you guys run, there's a lot of probably challenges  and maybe even like false starts or failures or pivots.  Any stories you can share of things that maybe didn't work out?  
**[0:09:44-0:09:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:09:44):**  Yeah.  Straight out of the gate, got into Whole Foods in 2006.  So they had this buy local and gave their store directors autonomy to bring in new products  
**[0:09:56-0:10:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:09:56):**  and it was awesome.  So I got walnuts and pasta sauce that we were distributing and rice and almonds.  I got 10 products in there just out of one meeting.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:10:06):**  I said, oh, here we go.  We're off to the races.  Well, they'd order like one case of rice, brown rice.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:10:13):**  So you're driving all the way down there and delivering it.  And then the next week, hey, we want a case of white rice.  And you say, hey, how about we just bundle all this together?  
**[0:10:22-0:10:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:10:22):**  Well, we can't do that.  So I'm losing money every single delivery down to there.  So I pulled out of Whole Foods with all those products.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:10:31):**  I thought that was going to be a big deal.  The biggest hurdle is predicting sales from...  So when we plant rice and when we start planning what acreage we're going to plant per variety,  
**[0:10:46-0:10:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:10:46):**  that's in January, February, that's when the planning is.  And then when you're actually planting the crop, it's April, May, and you're going to  harvest into September and October.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:10:54):**  You have to predict your sales through basically that following December.  So you have about 20 months of sales predictions on each variety with our businesses growing  pretty fast.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:11:08):**  And that's been a huge challenge.  And we've been overly optimistic on certain varieties and we've underproduced other varieties.  And a lot of people just don't understand that the actual nature part of farming.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:11:20):**  And then when you have a supplier that can major broadliner, it's pretty rare that you're  going to run out of jasmine rice because there's multiple suppliers and that's just not an  issue.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:11:31):**  And having to communicate that with customers at times can be challenging, but I think people  are starting to understand it more.  How about the complexity of working in the distribution business with other suppliers?  
**[0:11:42-0:11:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:11:42):**  You tend to be a large portion of their sales or are you a kind of side premium product  for many producers that are growing other things?  We're growing.  
**[0:11:52-0:12:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:11:52):**  We work with a really great farm that's a neighbor of ours and they do really interesting  crop rotations and they have, it's all organic.  They do a lot of dry beans and popcorn and things like that.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:12:03):**  So we've integrated them in our food service distribution business and that's really growing.  And then our True Origin Foods brand, the way that we've set that up is to really be  able to expand the folks that we work with.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:12:16):**  Initially, we just had a farm name brand, but that limits what other products you can  bring in.  True Origin Foods is set up where you can just go on the website and then enter the  
**[0:12:26-0:12:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:12:26):**  farmer ID that's printed underneath the best by date and then track it to your farm.  And so we have organic black beans and then two types of organic popcorn from them in  our brand.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:12:38):**  So I'd say that's probably our strongest relationship where I don't know, maybe 10% of their sales.  It's not huge, but it's growing.  But others are really folks that are just saying, Hey, look, I want to create a brand,  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:12:51):**  right?  I want to be proud of what we're doing.  I want to potentially isolate us from the volatility of the market.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:12:58):**  This is a great way for us to do that efficiently, right?  I don't need to do my driving around or whatever.  And in a lot of cases, I don't need to do my packaging.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:13:08):**  This guy can pack it for me and he can warehouse it and everything.  And so we just try and make it easy for people to develop those types of markets.  That's such an interesting insight about the brand.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:13:18):**  Are you a farm brand and what does that mean to whoever your consumer is and how many things  could they plausibly believe that one farm is producing versus a higher level brand where  each farm actually gets the chance to brand their own product or are they branding the  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:13:33):**  variety?  I hadn't really thought about that challenge.  Yeah, that's been cool.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:13:37):**  So I think it's really been hard to kind of noodle that through because we spent a lot  of time building our farm brand, but at the same time, it doesn't allow you to scale and  it doesn't allow you to offer really cool products from other growers.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:13:54):**  And it took a long time, I think, through that, but we're really happy with it, happy  how it turned out.  People can enter those farmer ID codes on the website and learn about exactly where  
**[0:14:03-0:14:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:14:03):**  the popcorn came from, or we do organic garbanzo beans.  And even from a rice standpoint, it allows us to scale up our production there, but still  maintaining that direct connection with the growers.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:14:16):**  I know there's, I end up at ag conferences.  I'm sure you do too, and people talk about what a consumers want.  And I always find those panels probably the most frustrating because it's a lot of like  
**[0:14:26-0:14:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:14:26):**  spin market data on what consumers say they want.  How would you answer that question around what a consumers want or are there things  that aren't talked about enough on panels like that in terms of what consumers really  
**[0:14:37-0:14:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:14:37):**  say and do and pay for?  I think number one is probably clean label, high quality food that's grown sustainably  and has grown in the United States.  
**[0:14:48-0:15:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:14:48):**  Those are the customers that I'm interested in.  Mothers and my demographic is probably 22 to 50 and generally the primary shopper.  And so, yeah, I think environmental sustainability, delicious food, right?  
**[0:15:04-0:15:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:15:04):**  That's important.  And something that's just clean and healthy.  I think it's pretty simple and a lot of people try and overcomplicate it, but that's their  
**[0:15:11-0:15:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:15:11):**  job.  So learn about new technologies, tools, practices, stay on the cutting edge, bleeding edge, wherever  you want to be in terms of new texts and tools and practices.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:15:22):**  On the farm side?  Yeah.  Well, I guess either actually.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:15:26):**  Yeah.  I'm pretty involved in the rice industry.  I'm on the rice commission as a board member.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:15:32):**  I'm on various boards at the national level with USA Rice.  And so that provides a lot of exposure to me with other farmers throughout the US and  that's been really good.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:15:43):**  And then we've worked very closely with the nature conservancy and other conservation  groups on our farm for over a decade to really run pilot programs for bird habitat.  We've done a little bit of stuff looking at ways to help with native salmon and the rivers  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:15:59):**  as well.  It's just always been something that's really interesting to me.  And our family as a whole has been early adopters for a long time.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:16:06):**  And so we've had yield monitors and all of our combines since 2003.  So gathering all that data and we've been doing prescription fertilization for about  10 years, RTK leveling for quite a long time.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:16:21):**  It's figuring out where those opportunities are to improve what we're doing and to get  a return on that investment.  Are there any areas of the business where you feel like there's a tech solution that  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:16:32):**  could be there but just isn't?  I think irrigations.  That's our biggest opportunity for investment.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:16:38):**  It's expensive to do what we're doing.  If you're growing wine grapes and you're making tens of thousands of dollars an acre, great.  You can invest in all that.  
**[0:16:49-0:17:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:16:49):**  You're growing rice and you're making a couple of hundred bucks an acre.  It doesn't really make sense, but that's the stuff that I'm really excited about.  Both from management standpoint, it just becomes more and more difficult to find folks that  
**[0:17:03-0:17:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:17:03):**  are willing to invest the time that it takes to really irrigate properly, but also just  the peace of mind that technology can add when you are managing a larger size area.  We've done some pilots with that, with remote monitoring of canal levels and water meter  
**[0:17:21-0:17:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:17:21):**  pumps or flow meters.  We did one with depth sensors in the rice fields.  I think there's definitely a technology out there.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:17:29):**  Actually a company from Australia called Rubicon has a really great solution, but currently  it's a little expensive for rice.  Yeah.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:17:38):**  We've heard a lot about and heard a lot about how frustrating some of the promises to growers  are around.  So people start out with, we'll just give you information about what to do and it's  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:17:45):**  okay.  How much can I do with that information?  And then, Oh, we'll actually make all the way on the other end is we'll make the decision  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:17:51):**  for you.  We actually will turn on and off the pumps and it's that's too far.  I actually don't want you to go that far either.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:17:55):**  And how the kind of venture capital playbook of what tech should do and either just give  all the information or actually turn things on and off.  And it doesn't meet the mark in terms of what you actually need.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:18:07):**  Control is a great solution, right?  So when we're irrigating and flooding our fields at the beginning of planting season,  we'll have a tremendous amount of flow coming down a canal and a lot of things can go wrong  
**[0:18:22-0:18:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:18:22):**  and they happen at night in general.  When you can get like an alarm or something like that says, Hey, this canal is too high  or whatever.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:18:30):**  That's really helpful.  Then if you have a field that's 15, 20 miles away, being able to start and stop a pump  based on either water availability in a canal or water level in the field, that's really  
**[0:18:42-0:18:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:18:42):**  handy.  Transitioning a little.  How do you think about growth or kind of financing growth for either the farm business or the  
**[0:18:50-0:18:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:18:50):**  distribution business?  What opportunities or challenges are you seeing there?  We have a line of credit to farm credit and they've been really great to work with through  
**[0:18:58-0:19:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:18:58):**  the distribution business.  The problem you run into with the distribution business, especially one that is dealing in  longer term products that are able to be stored for a longer amount of time is you sink a  
**[0:19:11-0:19:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:19:11):**  ton of money into inventory, right?  If you're in produce, you're flipping your warehouse every four or five days.  It's just a cashflow thing at that point, but we're growing a crop and we're either  
**[0:19:22-0:19:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:19:22):**  paying ourselves as growers in a timely manner, which we try and operate just like any other  mill would operate and pay the same schedule.  And we want our business to be attractive to other growers.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:19:35):**  That's how we operate.  And so you just end up with a ton of money in the inventory.  And so that becomes a little cumbersome at times.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:19:42):**  Do you see any solutions there coming down the pipeline for different forms of finance?  Any creative solutions to that problem or that's just part of doing business?  I think that's always just going to be part of it.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:19:54):**  At the end of the day, the grower needs to get paid on time and you're responsible for  that.  And if you sell through the product too fast, then you're out.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:20:04):**  And so our deal is we never want to run out of product.  We always want to be really reliable source of all the products we distribute.  And so it's just the trade off of the way that we've set up our business.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:20:16):**  I think with interest rates going up, it's definitely attractive to consider alternative  financing opportunities.  We just got a letter a couple of weeks ago, we're at 7% and there's supposed to be another  
**[0:20:30-0:20:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:20:30):**  hike coming.  And so it's trying to figure that out.  We've actually looked at where the market is and everything and just started personally  
**[0:20:39-0:20:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:20:39):**  loaning the company's business just to get part of that interest rate back, but keep  the money in the group.  Some of the conversations we've been having, I guess, especially on the farm side around  
**[0:20:50-0:21:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:20:50):**  finance and expansion, I guess two themes have come through really strongly that I'm  curious to test with you.  One is whereas the playbook previously was often expand kind of country under management  
**[0:21:02-0:21:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:21:02):**  and grow volume that with a combination of climate risks and interest rates and a number  of factors that that maybe makes less sense than thinking about more premiums, control  of supply chain, et cetera.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:21:15):**  So I imagine that resonates.  And then the other one is, are there other ways to expand?  Are there kind of equity options?  
**[0:21:21-0:21:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:21:21):**  Are there partners to bring in that would be aligned with kind of long-term growth?  And is that an option that seems worth exploring or might materialize?  For me, I just love the ability to control the whole supply chain.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:21:35):**  And so my biggest barrier to growing is acquiring land.  Rice ground used to go for, we bought some, I don't know, 10 years ago and it was like  $7,000 an acre.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:21:47):**  I was like losing sleep over it.  And now it's like 12.  And at the time we bought the $7,000 an acre piece, it has really good water.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:21:55):**  So we felt like we could pay a premium for it, but there's ground out there for 5,000.  And so what's happening in our area is due to regulation on groundwater pumping in the  South Valley, a lot of tree farmers are moving up into our area and they're buying rice ground  
**[0:22:12-0:22:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:22:12):**  that's traditionally heavy clay, but they're putting orchards on it because it's a lot  cheaper than orchard ground.  And then they've developed root stocks that are resilient in those conditions.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:22:22):**  And so it's really priced us out of the market.  Hopefully being able to control our supply chain, we're able to extract the premium from  that and we're able to pay a little bit more than other folks.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:22:33):**  But I would say that that's the thing I'm most interested in is figuring out a way to  acquire more land and manage the land how I want it, right?  From a habitat standpoint, growing cover crops, things like that, like really improving that  
**[0:22:47-0:22:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:22:47):**  land and improving efficiency of irrigation and things like that.  And I think the only way you can really do that is if you own it long term.  How do you think about those trends?  
**[0:22:57-0:23:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:22:57):**  It seems like everything's a bit of a mess around fertilizer, water, inputs, that whole  space seems pretty tough, especially in rice and especially in California.  How are you thinking about and dealing with the shifts and trends and challenges there?

**[0:23:18-0:23:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:23:18):**  I am trying to incorporate cover cropping a little bit more and see what I'm going to  get out of that from a fertility standpoint and potentially be able to reduce any other  inputs there.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:23:29):**  What does that look like in rice?  It's a winter cover crop.  It's not a lot of people do it.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:23:35):**  It's mostly organic.  People will do that, but we're doing it.  I'm working on more of our conventional fields to start doing that, but you harvest September,  
**[0:23:45-0:24:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:23:45):**  October, I will go in and chop the straw with a flail chopper.  And then traditionally we'll disc the field one time.  Then we've been planting vetch and we'll fly the vetch seed on, and then use a roller to  
**[0:24:00-0:24:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:24:00):**  roll that and incorporate that into the soil.  And then you hope you get some rain over the winter time.  And then early April, when that vetch starts flowering, you can either incorporate it,  
**[0:24:10-0:24:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:24:10):**  you can flail mow at first and then disc it in or just disc it in.  So there's some challenges there.  There's definitely additional costs of doing that.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:24:18):**  So just really trying to balance that out.  I think a lot of our customers are really interested in regenerative farming and I am  as well just trying to figure out how do you make that work in a rice system?  
**[0:24:29-0:24:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:24:29):**  So I'm envious of a lot of other cropping systems where you can no till and drill and  all that.  But the way that rice is grown in California, you're pretty limited on what kind of regenerative  
**[0:24:41-0:24:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:24:41):**  farming practices you can utilize.  The regen conversation seems so big right now, especially, and just also confusing and  polarizing and I'm fascinated by even to your point, okay, what does that mean in rice?  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:24:55):**  What are we talking about here?  What do you want me to do?  What people talk about is, hey, we want to convert all the acres to regenerative farming.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:25:01):**  Let's look at our definition of regenerative farming, right?  You have a lot of them that say, okay, what has to be organic?  Well, that's just not realistic.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:25:08):**  If you want to make a transition and make a big impact, you need to look outside of  organic and I've been pushing that pretty hard.  I've been involved in some regenerative organizations and trying to talk about, hey, look, we can  
**[0:25:21-0:25:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:25:21):**  do soil health.  There's very little erosion in farming rice.  It's just flat rice patties, right?  
**[0:25:28-0:25:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:25:28):**  There's not a lot of opportunity for stuff to move out with water.  We have an amazing story about biodiversity and habitat.  What are the opportunities for our industry to really highlight things that we can do  
**[0:25:42-0:25:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:25:42):**  that should be considered regenerative?  They're above and beyond.  They're making a huge impact on the environment, but it's hard to have that conversation with  
**[0:25:51-0:26:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:25:51):**  a lot of people that just aren't used to that system.  They just discount what you're doing and say, why don't you just cover crop and then no  till and it just flat doesn't work.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:26:01):**  During the drought in Australia a couple of years ago, I spent some time in rice growing  regions and they didn't grow rice because it didn't make sense with water, but they  were planting a lot of grazing crops and putting sheep out, which then is just interesting  
**[0:26:13-0:26:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:26:13):**  from a whole new system.  If you haven't had livestock before, like what kinds of infrastructure and decisions  and expertise or growing pumpkins and then we're like, what do we do with the pumpkins?  
**[0:26:23-0:26:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:26:23):**  But interesting questions of how much of that is a full transition of the system to, okay,  we're going to be a different kind of farmer and what kind of shifts in identity and supply  chain come with that?  
**[0:26:34-0:26:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:26:34):**  Or is this a near term couple of seasons response to volatility?  I thought that was pretty fascinating.  Yeah.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:26:41):**  Now that you're getting more rain than you probably want at some time, then there might  be a longer term shift back to the permanent or the old rotation.  So yeah, that's the other challenge with the regenerative farming thing is people just  
**[0:26:56-0:27:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:26:56):**  want to lock you in on, okay, we've got to do these practices every year and this is  the rotation you need and the climate just changes and the economics of what you can  grow changes.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:27:05):**  And that's a really important component too.  And that's under discussed in the regenerative conversation.  It's just flat out economics.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:27:13):**  When you think about your farm and the distribution business in, I don't know, say 20 years, what  do you think will look the same and what do you think will look different?  I think on the farm, it's just that constant evolution of new technology and the growers  
**[0:27:28-0:27:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:27:28):**  here in California have invested in a research station and spent a lot of money on that.  And they're just coming up with really great stuff and new varieties all the time.  And really looking at the market and looking for opportunities for growers in California  
**[0:27:44-0:27:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:27:44):**  to differentiate what they're doing.  So they develop the Basmati variety and the Jasmine variety that I'm growing, and that's  allowing us to compete with imported product.  
**[0:27:53-0:28:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:27:53):**  So that's exciting.  I think just that the continued investment in the industry is really great.  So I see us growing even more varieties on our farm to meet different market needs.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:28:05):**  The distribution side, continued scaling of that.  I think there's a pretty decent sized market that we haven't really touched.  And I think that consumer mindset is shifting in our favor over time.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:28:16):**  A lot of the young folks are going to universities and things like that are really interested  in food and food policy.  So yeah, I'm very optimistic about the future and want to continue to put in the hard work  
**[0:28:29-0:28:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:28:29):**  to set us up to be successful.  One of the things that we ask startups often is as you think about being successful in  your business, what do you think you have to be good at?  
**[0:28:38-0:28:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:28:38):**  Do you have to be really good at writing software?  Do you have to be really good at raising money from investors, et cetera?  What do you think you have to be really good at?  
**[0:28:46-0:28:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:28:46):**  And I don't know, is that something you like being good at?  Is it meaningful to you?  I think communicating and even though sometimes it's not comfortable, engaging with a diverse  
**[0:28:57-0:29:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:28:57):**  group of stakeholders to understand where everyone is coming from and try and really  tell your story, but also really learn from what other folks are looking for in their  food system and things that we can really consider implementing on our farm.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:29:13):**  So when we started working with that nature conservancy in 2010, a lot of times growers  are looking at organizations like that as adversarial and couldn't be further from the  truth.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:29:26):**  And so that's been really cool.  And I'm glad that we kind of step out of your comfort zone and make those connections.  And it's been super positive for us and for the whole industry.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:29:34):**  It seems like those conversations and the types of people and the pressures in those  rooms are only going to get more intense and probably more diverse in the future.  The one thing that I try and talk about a little bit, particularly related to growers,  
**[0:29:49-0:30:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:29:49):**  is try and get as much as you can to really follow where your commodity is going.  I go to a lot of food shows.  I go to Natural Foods product, Expo West, Expo East, Fancy Food Show.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:30:02):**  And it's really amazing to see what companies are doing with the products that you grow.  And I think there are opportunities to really learn from what folks are doing.  So that's just kind of something that I always encourage people to do.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:30:16):**  Do you have an example of something where you were like, oh, who knew they were doing  that with my product?  Now I'm going to do something different, like any kind of surprising insights or examples?  
**[0:30:26-0:30:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:30:26):**  I think it's from my standpoint, it's really about just following trends and understanding  who's on the cutting edge of whether it's just a product innovation or a way of storytelling.  I really get a lot out of that.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:30:39):**  And I really like to look at primarily rice, but just rice from all over the world and  what people are doing differently and how they're growing the rice or their practices.  You can look at what kind of quality characteristics there are, their blends of different varieties.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:30:55):**  There's just kind of seems boring, right, rice.  But there's a lot of pretty cool stuff going on.  So I like to look at that.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:31:00):**  Michael's journey and ecosystem of businesses are fascinating to us, especially as we continue  digging into not only agricultural technologies, but tech across the supply chain and the wider  food system that can unlock new opportunities.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:31:12):**  A few key insights have stuck with me.  First, I appreciated Michael's call for a more nuanced understanding of what the heck  people mean by regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:31:22):**  Though there's certainly environmental drawbacks to the large amounts of water used to grow  rice in places like California, the ecosystem and wildlife benefits that Michael described,  paired with drastically shortening the otherwise very global rice supply chain, seems a relevant  
**[0:31:36-0:31:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:31:36):**  part of the calculation of how sustainable California rice is.  This discussion was a good reminder of how dogmatic and stale conversations around region  ag can sometimes be.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:31:47):**  And there has to be more complexity in our vision for a more climate resilient farming  system than just plant cover crops and don't tell.  Second, it was fascinating to hear Michael discuss his strategy of owning his supply  
**[0:31:59-0:32:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:31:59):**  chain and how difficult that can be.  It struck me just how challenging that middle part of the value chain can be to learn and  manage through, and in particular, how different the skill sets are and required networks can  
**[0:32:11-0:32:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:32:11):**  be from running a production farm.  But at the same time, by doing this work, Michael unlocked one of the most discouraging  aspects of growing commodity crops.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:32:20):**  In his words, controlling distribution allows him to be a price setter, not a price taker.  Even with all his experience, Michael is still working through challenges around inventory  levels, defining brands, and predicting sales.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:32:33):**  But owning his supply chain gives him an advantage, whether he's working with consumers, farmers,  or even buying land.  On that note, I appreciated Michael's highlighting of the opportunity area around alternative  
**[0:32:43-0:32:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:32:43):**  financing, especially for land acquisition.  This is something we've been looking at closely, and we think that fintech that empowers farmers  to acquire land and manage it with a specific focus on climate outcomes will be a major  
**[0:32:55-0:33:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:32:55):**  source of value creation in the future.  Michael also highlighted irrigation tech as an opportunity area.  We've covered this a ton in the past on the show, so we've linked some episodes and a  
**[0:33:06-0:33:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:33:06):**  report in the show notes.  But before we say goodbye, I wanted to share a bit more of our fundraising out loud journey.  This week, my business partner Matthew and I are continuing our conversation about the  
**[0:33:16-0:33:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:33:16):**  journey of raising with some thoughts on the challenges we're facing, especially around  finding and using time with both the short-term pressure of the raise and the long-term priority  of building real relationships.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:33:26):**  Speaking of focusing attention, one thing that's challenging is we tell founders to  focus.  I want us to stay focused.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:33:33):**  And so there's a category of conversations that I have less time for right now, the kind  of career advice and general connections, like how do you just prioritize what is a  limited resource?  
**[0:33:45-0:33:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:33:45):**  And anyways, I emailed a potential investor who said they're raising a fund to funds,  they want to invest in impact managers, they've done a first close, et cetera, et cetera.  And this person's in California and I'm headed there soon.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:33:58):**  And so I just said, Hey, do you want to catch up for coffee?  I'm in town.  And the email I got back was sadly like no intro, no response, sadly, cannot meet, need  
**[0:34:07-0:34:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:34:07):**  to push off to Q1, my best.  That was the email I got back and I was like, both wow, that like how abrupt and whatever,  but also man, the power of focus there.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:34:18):**  And, but can you imagine us saying that to startups right now where they're like, Hey,  do you want to catch up?  And we're trying to build a relationship and get to know people.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:34:26):**  And we're like, sorry, sadly, cannot meet.  Like it's only as I sent an email back saying, good luck with the fundraise.  I get that it's tough out there.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:34:32):**  Like we're raising two was more just opportunistic to grab a coffee in town.  And the person came back and actually sent a pretty nice email around.  Thanks my best to you.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:34:40):**  My biggest issue is just staying super laser focused on fundraising.  There's so many interesting and talented folks to talk to and to help, but I just have to  stay focused, which is obviously like tonally nicer.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:34:55):**  Maybe Tim play is the second email.  Yeah.  But I just yeah, just reflecting on that focus, but they are relationships.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:35:03):**  And for us too, like that's why we're not.  Not talking to founders outside of Australia right now, because we do want to be investing  in those companies and learning about those spaces and meeting those founders.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:35:13):**  And yet like discipline focus might say to send them the sadly cannot talk right now  response.  Yeah.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:35:20):**  I mean, it's interesting.  I think that idea of like, how would you be more focused as you were describing that and  talking about the advice we give to founders about always be raising.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:35:33):**  I was reminded of an Australian founder who just came back from the States and had done  a bunch of VC meetings and they were expressing being pretty confounded by the breadth of  opinions of VCs about when they want to meet with startups.  
**[0:35:51-0:36:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:35:51):**  It's like some of them said, yeah, we want to talk to you all the time.  And half of them said, do not contact us until you're absolutely definitely fundraising.  So that goes to the, I guess the reflection I have here is if we were trying to say that  
**[0:36:06-0:36:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/building-a-food-business-ecosystem-from-the-farm-up-with-michael-bosworth-of-next-generation-foods#t=0:36:06):**  it's just your perspective or just their perspective, I think you miss it.  So if you try to focus your effort around maximizing the outcome of your fundraising,  you have to take both perspectives into account.

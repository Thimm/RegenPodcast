### Agtech - So What?  (2020-03-12)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome back to the Ag Tech So What podcast, brought to you by Agthentic.  I'm your host, Sarah Nollet.  Today we're back with episode three in our Regen Ag series.  If you missed the last two, definitely check them out and let us know what you think about  regenerative agriculture, the term, the practices, and the hype.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:00:21):**  Today we're looking at Regen Ag through a different lens.  Our guest is Jay Watson, who oversees the Regen Ag work for General Mills.  Jay started out at General Mills in procurement, sourcing and hedging ag commodities such as  corn and oats.  In 2015, he moved to an oat sourcing role, where he saw the launch of their oat sustainability  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:00:42):**  program, which we talk about.  And then in 2017, Jay joined the sustainability team across all priority ingredient categories  for General Mills, where recently they've begun to focus on soil health and ultimately  regenerative agriculture.  Here's Jay Watson.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:01:00):**  I was given the opportunity to come to the sustainability full time to work across all  of our 10 priority ingredient categories in 2017.  And so I've been on the team for about three years.  Some of that focus on continuous improvement and efficiency and sustainability has pivoted  in the last few years to identifying that soil health is really a key unlock and soil  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:01:24):**  health being a cornerstone for regenerative agriculture, one of our newer commitments  is that 2030 commitment to advance regenerative agriculture on a million acres.  I imagine most listeners are familiar with at least some of the General Mills brands.  They produce and market more than 100 brands in more than 100 countries on six continents.  You might recognize names like Betty Crocker, Hamburger Helper, Pillsbury Refrigerated Dough  
**[0:01:52-0:01:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:01:52):**  or Latina Fresh Salsa.  They're also big in cereals with brands like Cheerios, Chex and a favorite treat of mine  when I was a kid, Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  What does all this mean from a sourcing and sustainability perspective?  The lion's share of our business globally is in North America, but we do have operations  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:02:12):**  in many other countries, not as maybe as large of a global player as some of our peers in  the space, but we're big buyers of grain and dairy, as you can imagine with things like  cereal and snacks, Haagen-Dazs, ice cream, Yolkley yogurt.  We have a big meals and baking portfolio, so big purchasers of wheat.  Again, my oat sourcing experience has spent a lot of time with our Cheerios organization  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:02:39):**  and also in Nature Valley.  Also had a chance to have a few conversations with Uncle Toby's down in Australia, but it  runs the gamut.  We have fruits, vegetables, nuts, animal proteins based on the different products we market  in different countries around the globe.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:02:58):**  That's why our sustainability work is pretty diverse.  I spend some part of my days working on grains in North America, and I might be talking about  dairy in France, and then another part of the day might be onto cocoa or vanilla in  our sustainability programs there, which are very focused on smallholder farmers and their  livelihoods and communities.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:03:22):**  General Mills' approach to sustainability programs and public commitments has evolved  over time, focusing on different metrics and areas of their supply chain, including both  their operations and their suppliers.  Before my time, probably back in around 2011, 2012, we chartered a global raw material risk  assessment to understand, based on what we purchased and where those items were coming  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:03:47):**  from, what sustainability risks and opportunities were present.  Out of that assessment came our 2020 Sustainable Sourcing Commitment that we announced in 2013.  Oats is one of those categories, so just connecting back to some of my experience.  I'm going to try to get all 10 of them.  Oats, U.S. wheat, dry-milled corn in the United States, sugar beets, sugar cane, dairy, fiber  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:04:16):**  packaging, palm oil, vanilla, and cocoa.  Those are the 10 categories that we set a commitment for for 2020, so this is a big  year for that reason.  I had a look, and according to the 2019 Global Responsibility Report, General Mills is sourcing  91% of the raw materials for these 10 commodities sustainably.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:04:37):**  Given the range in the commodities on this list, General Mills has had to use different  strategies and definitions for sustainability.  We have different approaches to our sustainability definition and our implementation plan, just  based on what we believe those opportunities are as it relates to social, environmental,  and economic sustainability.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:04:58):**  At least in North America, a big focus, again, on those grains and sustainability being defined  as continuous improvement over time against environmental metrics.  Taking something like yield and flipping it to the inverse to say, how much land does  it take to produce a bushel of corn or a ton of sugar beets and hoping to drive improvement  over time.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:05:25):**  We have data for some of our programs going back to 2012, some that are newer, so we can  document where have producers become more efficient from a natural resource standpoint.  That's a lot of the work, at least for North America and some of those crops.  The other, cocoa and vanilla, there's different definitions and approaches for those types  of ingredients.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:05:45):**  Yeah, increasingly obvious that it's not a simple answer, and even coming out with some  of those goals is not a straightforward task or commitment to make.  I actually reviewed a number of food companies' sustainability plans.  It was around in 2013, 2014, I think, just when you guys had made this commitment.  It struck me how different everyone's approach was and seemingly how different the drivers  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:06:10):**  might be for different companies.  Risk versus marketing versus the right thing to do and how aspirational the targets were.  Big lofty goals and, in some cases, not a lot of clarity of whether you'd get there  or how you'd get there.  Do you have a sense of, at that time when General Mills made that first plan for those  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:06:30):**  10 commodities, what the drivers were and how much of a really big stretch goal it felt  like versus something that was very achievable?  I think it's a great question.  I think we have a history of making bold commitments and being very open about not knowing how  to get there.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:06:50):**  The commitment with a long enough runway, I think, gives us the time to be able to figure  some of those things out.  I think when we made the 2020 commitment, we had one sourcing sustainability resource.  Now we probably have four or five.  The team has grown to support the work.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:07:08):**  We've also done quite a bit of work with our sourcing organization to build capacity and  capability within our buyer network, from which I came from, to really be partners in  our approach and to advancing the sustainability agenda, really, even in some cases, having  ownership of some of our targets within those category sourcing responsibilities.  That's been huge.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:07:34):**  I think with the 2020 sourcing sustainability commitment and also our Scope 3 science-based  greenhouse gas reduction target, both of those are really good instances where we knew it  was the right thing to do.  That's been a core value of General Mills for quite some time, but we knew that it was  a proactive play to lead in the industry and create a bit of an invitation for other companies  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:07:58):**  to follow suit.  That's happened.  A long history of leading in this sustainable sourcing space.  Really having all the ideas or all the innovations really in place to be able to drive to the  targets that we set for ourselves.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:08:17):**  We know that a lot of that is yet to come for, say, our climate ambition.  And certainly as we think about Regenerine and VAG, there's lots of enabling technologies  and partnership models that are not here yet that will be really critical to advancing  towards our target.  When General Mills made these commitments, Jay was working in sourcing focused on oats.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:08:39):**  What was it like working with their suppliers, oat farmers, to meet these sustainability  targets?  I was first proud as a category buyer because I think we're all trying to find additional  purpose in our role and if we can connect it to something like sustainability and positive  outcomes for people planning a profit, that's another nice area to work in if in addition  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:09:01):**  to the other accountabilities you have as a buyer.  But what I also appreciate was that General Mills' approach was to try and drive towards  industry standards.  Our early involvement and leadership within something like Field to Market, the Alliance  for Sustainable Agriculture, the whole goal was to say, let's create a standard approach  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:09:22):**  to measure sustainability for row crops in the United States.  We can't all afford to be doing separate things, using separate approaches, working in silos.  And really, if we're asking the producer to participate and provide data, we can't be  asking them to fill out 10 different surveys for 10 different companies that they might  be selling to, right through different aggregators or grain companies.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:09:47):**  It's not maybe a story of a specific point in time, but a story a lot over several years  of seeing that alliance come together, being able to participate in a process where there  is an agreement on an approach to measuring sustainability and then continuously improving  that approach while getting input from food companies and retailers, farmers, agribusinesses.  That's how the committees and sectors are set up in the field to market so that it really  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:10:18):**  is meant to be this big tent that can come together to align on some shared approaches,  principles and standards so that we're making it as easy as possible for different supply  chain actors, including producers, to participate.  And so it's been nice to see that.  Jay is talking about Field to Market, the Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture, a multi-stakeholder  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:10:41):**  initiative that includes grower groups, brands like General Mills, conservation groups, universities,  and even ag tech companies who have all come together to create ways of defining, measuring  and advancing sustainability across food, fiber and fuel.  One of the big things they do is benchmarking sustainability performance using a tool called  Field Print.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:11:02):**  Through this work at the farm level, Jay has spent time on farms and with growers, learning  from them about what's working and what drives them to make decisions on farm.  As you can imagine, working on oats has been a fair bit of time in Canada because that's  one of our, Manitoba and Saskatchewan are key growing regions for us.  So just to understand the benefits of oats in a rotation and hearing producers talk about  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:11:25):**  why they like to grow oats, not because there's Cheerios for a market or Nature Valley, but  how it can be really advantageous for them to have it as part of the rotation with other  crops like canola or soybeans or wheat.  So lots of learning opportunities.  I don't know if this has ever happened to you, but I've definitely had the experience  
**[0:11:46-0:11:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:11:46):**  of learning about a specific practice or whether it's chemical usage or some kind of tilling  or rotations or anything that might get talked about.  And then you go talk to an actual farmer about how it applies to their operation and what  doesn't doesn't make sense.  And you realize just how oversimplified some of the narratives are at the consumer end.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:12:08):**  I don't know if that's ever happened to you.  Totally.  Yeah.  And there's been some unique experiences too, where we've had the opportunity to bring influencers,  key like food influencers out to farm.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:12:21):**  And that's been eye-opening, I think for the farmers, for these food bloggers, for us at  General Mills.  Yeah.  To just kind of open the eyes and kind of squash some of the misperceptions or misconceptions  about farming.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:12:35):**  I think one of my favorite ones was just this concept of kind of corporate farms and large  scale operations that don't really care about the products that they're producing or don't  really care about the end consumer.  And we had an opportunity to bring some folks out to one of the producers that's connected  to our Cheerios supply chain.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:12:56):**  And we had homesteading photos out as part of this dinner where you can say, this is  a fourth generation farm.  These are people, these are families that this is how they make their living.  And we should understand and appreciate it a little bit more in the role they play in  the food value chain.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:13:15):**  Yeah, sure.  I love that nuance of the family farm versus corporate farm.  For some reason in agriculture, we like to punish businesses for being successful and  run well with systems and processes.  We'd much rather think of them as tiny and unorganized for some reason, but it doesn't  
**[0:13:33-0:13:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:13:33):**  make a whole lot of sense.  So that's really good learnings and great to be raising the profile of those things.  It sounds like, and tell me if I'm wrong, Jay, in summarizing here that the initial  sustainability work at General Mills was around sourcing and then kind of shifted or evolved  to have a greenhouse gas emissions focus and now has evolved again to think about soil  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:13:59):**  health and regenerative agriculture.  A, is that true?  And B, what's driving the new focus on Regen Ag?  Yeah, I'd say it's true, I'd add maybe one piece.  The work started in our own manufacturing facilities before sourcing, right?  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:14:14):**  So working on energy efficiencies or cutting out waste, things that we could control, right?  And so that work's still going on today, right?  But I think some of the insights as part of our enterprise footprint effort was that from  an emissions standpoint, our manufacturing facilities only represent about 10% of our  emissions if we look from farm all the way to ford to landfill.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:14:37):**  And so that's where sourcing and agriculture came into clear focus as if we want to make  a real impact and reduce our footprint, we need to go and fish where the fish are.  And that agriculture became the clear place to do that.  And not just from an emissions standpoint, but also we think about our water usage, you  know, a large chunk of that's in agriculture as well.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:14:59):**  As General Mills moved from assessing the risk of various raw materials in the supply  chain, to identifying opportunities, to making commitments around their environmental footprint,  soil health became a key focus.  Give a lot of credit to Jerry Lynch, who was our previous chief sustainability officer  who solves the potential and promise of soil health and worked to get by and internally  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:15:21):**  to make some leading investments through our General Mills Foundation to support some of  that foundational soil health research, education and outreach extension efforts.  And once we got into soil health and it became kind of a natural evolution to soil health  as the cornerstone for regenerative agriculture, with regenerative agriculture having positive  outcomes not just with soil, but what we talk about is biodiversity, water, farm profitability,  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:15:48):**  economic resilience.  And when that approach around soil health initially and then RegenAg more broadly came  about, what was the response from either, well, both of the consumer side and the grower  side in terms of that term and or those, you know, set of practices and principles?  Yeah, I'll address the consumer piece first.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:16:12):**  I mean, I don't think there was a lot of consumer communication or focus on that, at least initially,  because I think we needed to figure out more about soil health and what it could mean and  how we could activate some different things within our key sourcing regions.  So I don't know that there was much of a reaction in the consumer front because we weren't really  talking about it.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:16:31):**  Of course, we've done more of that since with some of our smaller challenger brands in our  national and organic business with things like Annie's Homegrown or Epic Provisions  where there's more of a connection to soil health and regenerative agriculture.  So we're starting to get a little bit more consumer insights in that space.  As it pertains to farmers, you know, I would say in some parts of the country, again, speaking  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:16:56):**  mostly about North America, I think there was, for those that kind of were maybe practicing  soil health principles or applying them on their farm, I think the reaction was pretty  positive.  Okay, like you're seeing what I'm seeing, General Mills, and kind of a little bit of  like, what are you going to do about it?  
**[0:17:12-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:17:12):**  How can you help me?  But there's certainly a lot of producers that didn't really understand soil health yet,  hadn't heard it, where they lived, it wasn't really a movement yet.  And there's still parts of the country where I think that's still the case.  But I think coming back to our sustainability goals and objectives, if we're focused on  
**[0:17:32-0:17:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:17:32):**  driving better resource efficiency as part of our continuous improvement efforts, we  would be generating reports through some of our tech data partners to say, okay, here's  your environmental footprint for your field and all your fields that you enrolled in the  time.  Here's the average of the group.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:17:50):**  The goal has always been enable some of that benchmarking so a producer can make a decision  about what to do on their farm, maybe a little bit differently to drive improved environmental  outcomes.  And soil health kept rising to the top, I think for us, and hopefully for some producers  to say, okay, well, if I want to say, for example, improve my energy use efficiency,  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:18:09):**  might I look into something like no till because I'm going to be burning less diesel, but probably  in some cases, not necessarily connecting that to soil health.  It's more just about economics.  And that's where I think, depending on who you're talking to, they're adopting different  and new principles or practices, maybe because of soil health, maybe because of economics,  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:18:29):**  maybe about farm legacy, maybe they're worried about regulation.  And so really trying to bring a very broad and diverse value proposition to producers  as we think about enabling this movement, given that we know no one farm is the same  as another.  Yeah, how do you, I mean, that's definitely a challenge day of each farm is different  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:18:50):**  and the practices that might work in one area aren't actually the ones that would work in  another or, you know, they're not, they don't have the same underlying conditions or capabilities  to take advantage of those practices.  How do you, and you mentioned data, how do you think about General Mills' role?  Is it kind of raising awareness and doing some of that benchmarking?  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:19:10):**  Are there incentives that you guys provide, whether premiums or long-term contracts to  actually move the needle or tip the scales on some of this stuff?  How do you guys see your role?  Yeah, we're doing, we're doing most of those things.  It just is dependent on this, the product and the supply chain, the region, the kind  
**[0:19:30-0:19:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:19:30):**  of producer readiness.  Again, in some of those brands where we're marketing it, there's different contracts  in place.  There's premiums with more direct farm relationships, but in other places it's, and some of the  pilots that we've announced publicly, it's more around supporting producers and their  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:19:46):**  kind of evolution in their approach and mindset to managing farm.  And so it's more education, training and technical assistance, one-on-one coaching, and that's  funded by General Mills.  You know, that's, that's something we can do now is to support that technical assistance  as we see that as being a really key gap.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:06):**  Because we hear from a lot of producers is, hey, you know what, I'm energized.  I just went to a soil health conference or learned about regenerative ag from someone  and I got back to my farm and I'm just not sure where to start or what to do.  Right?  Because it is unique to their operation.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:22):**  And so what we've done to kind of fill some of that need is to partner with the Soil Health  Academy on the train and the education, but then also understanding ag, which is one of  Gabe Brown's consulting organizations where there's a, there's a regenerative ag consultant  that comes alongside a producer to say, okay, let's build a plan for your unique operation.  And we're funding those producers in our programs for three years as part of our pilots.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:49):**  And so that's, you know, it's not a, it's not a financial assistance play where we're  providing cost share.  We are doing that in some places, but we really view one of the key barriers is this, this  understanding of how the ecosystem could function and an understanding of how to apply regenerative  principles to a unique operation.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:07):**  So that's where we've chosen to make investments.  And we've had pretty good interest from producers in the regions where we have pilots.  I mean, say we've, we've always had more producers who want to be a part of the program than  we have funding for, which I guess is a good problem to have.  And we're, and we're trying to figure out, right, like for that specific place, because  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:26):**  we are taking more of a place-based approach to try and understand the uniqueness of that  system and those producers in the program.  Like what is it that they need?  We can believe that we know, but until we sit down and speak with them, they may not  need much technical assistance.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:41):**  Maybe it is something different.  What is the enabling environment look like for each place?  And then I think we can flex and adapt as needed and say, okay, if we have funding,  may we move a little bit more of the funding or focus to social and cultural support or  financial cost share.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:58):**  Another key incentive that gets talked about in the sustainability space is premiums, actually  paying the producer more for a certain practice or outcome.  Jay says there are some challenges with this, especially for Regen Ag.  Premiums when we're, when we don't really have yet a way or alignment with a business  to talk about it is a tough proposition, one that all farmers want.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:22:21):**  And I address the question all the time, if a consumer's not asking for it yet, it's not  to say we can't create demand because that's what we do as a food company.  But regenerative ag is a tough thing to understand for many.  And we have an opportunity to just to help people understand kind of like general farming  practices and how the system works, let alone a very different way of thinking about the  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:22:45):**  farm as an ecosystem and being able to produce food while restoring the function of that  ecosystem at the same time.  And so it's tough to sell in, hey, we should pay a premium for this product if we can't,  we don't know how we're going to talk about it and drive value.  And if we're going to pay a premium for the product, we really need to make sure that  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:23:04):**  we get that grain or that milk or whatever it is.  And it requires a different supply chain infrastructure to do that if we want to segregate some of  that to be more unique than the commodity grains or animal proteins or dairy that we're  buying.  And so I think, yeah, just understanding what's the need and going to origin and listening,  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:23:27):**  something that's, I think, sometimes challenging to do, but putting our goals and interests  to the side a little bit and just really trying to understand what role can we best play to  accelerate this momentum that might already exist and to just meet producers where they're  at.  So I'm pleased that we've been able to kind of get on a good path with the pilots that  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:23:49):**  we have up online now.  They are pilots because we're learning a lot.  And I don't think we would say that we have it all figured out.  And like I mentioned before, a big part of that learning is just learning from producers  and what's working, what's not.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:04):**  And so we're making sure to remind leaders internally at General Mills that this is something  we're piloting and we're going to need to be flexible and agile, but it's the right  thing to do.  And producers need support right now.  And as a food company, we have a unique role to play where we can connect consumer to producer.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:24):**  But one of the other things we've done is really, I think, developed a unique experimental  design because a lot of the research in the agricultural space is fairly reductive.  Let's control all things but one variable and see what the outcome of the change in  that practice is on a particular outcome.  Well, that's not really how the systems work.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:48):**  They're living systems that are connected.  And so we need to study the whole system.  And so our research and the outcomes that we're measuring, our treatment for this research  that we're doing is a farmer who has a regenerative education and support and who is bringing  a regenerative approach to their operation compared to a farm that's not.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:09):**  And there could be five things that that producer is changing.  So we're not, you know, it might be hard to stomach for some, but we're not going to be  able to, we have a change in an outcome say in soil health.  We're not going to be able to point to the one thing that drove that because it's not  one thing.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:25):**  It's a systems approach to managing the operation.  And so that's a space that we've kind of plugged because some of the research institutions  in these regions, although some of the research may want to go there, I don't know that they're  really set up to do that type of research.  And so I think it's a place where we've been leading and so grateful to have a really strong  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:45):**  technical team on staff.  I mean, what are the food companies have a PhD soil scientist, a couple other PhD agronomists,  like that's not really that common.  So I'm so, so thankful that those are some of the peers I get to work with because I  want this work to be impactful for the producers, for General Mills, but I also want it to be  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:04):**  credible and to be supported by the best available science.  Yeah, well that's right.  The supply chain complexity and the farming systems complexity means that making some  kind of commitment to consumers is actually really difficult.  And right now we often don't have the data or technologies to be able to say, yes, for  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:27):**  sure this much carbon was sequestered or this much soil health was improved or this much  regen was done because that's not even a concept that exists.  And if it was, we wouldn't know what to measure and it would be different in different areas.  And so I guess you end up or the fear maybe is that you end up with what a criticism of  regen might be, which is that it's kind of evangelical, that it's squishy and more about  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:52):**  a movement, which is a word that you used and doesn't have that science.  And yet you've mentioned science and data a couple of times.  So yeah, I guess what's your kind of response to maybe a criticism of regen that it's more  evangelical and not grounded in solid science or good farming practices?  Yeah, to those critics, I would just ask them to share what their definition of regenerative  
**[0:27:13-0:27:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:27:13):**  agriculture is because I think it varies and ours is focused on outcomes and you can't  really have an outcomes focused approach if you're not measuring outcomes with the best  available science.  And so, I mean, if regen was just, and some might be thinking about regen as the next  natural, where it doesn't really mean anything.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:27:34):**  I mean, that was a big issue in the States.  Like what does natural mean?  There's no standard, like organic, right?  What does natural production or natural farming practices mean?  With regenerative agriculture, I mean, I think anybody who will listen and who's thinking  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:27:51):**  about making some sort of claim or just talking about regenerative agriculture as part of  their strategy, I'm really pushing them to say, you need to measure regeneration then.  Because I think that's what makes it legitimate and different is that if we can measure soil  health, also say aggregate stability or water infiltration or microbial activity or soil  organic matter, soil carbon, if we can show that those things got better over time, then  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:28:20):**  we can talk about how this farming approach regenerated soil.  The same can be said for water, profitability, biodiversity.  We just need to make sure that we have the right protocol to measure those things.  So I'd say for companies or different organizations that are talking about regenerative ag, but  don't really have a measurement approach, yeah, I think in a lot of ways, regenerative  
**[0:28:43-0:28:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:28:43):**  ag is going to feel pretty squishy.  But when we're thinking about regenerative ag, one of those focuses being on soil health  and soil carbon, we can't have it be squishy because we intend to connect our regenerative  ag outcomes and soil health and soil carbon to our enterprise wide greenhouse gas reduction  commitment.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:29:02):**  So for any company out there that's making a scope three science-based target that includes  agriculture and agricultural emissions, soil health provides that promise and say, okay,  can we see how much carbon's in the soil now and how much later so we can understand influx  and outflux and then what might we be able to account for in our supply chain.  So it's very real, very rooted in science for us.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:29:26):**  And I think some of the criticism is from those that maybe are looking at regenerative  ag differently, defining it differently, and maybe don't understand all the different approaches  out there that are really focused on measuring regeneration.  I'd say that we're not unique.  I think there's others looking at this, but we have some unique resources at General Mills  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:29:46):**  that are building the research plans and protocols to say, how do we measure regeneration?  Because if we're going to say regenerative ag, we need to be able to point to something  getting better or something restoring or being rebuilt.  Do you take the same approach, Jay, that you have in the carbon footprinting and greenhouse  gas space of partnering with others, especially on that data collection or measurement side?  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:30:10):**  And if not yet, where are there opportunities in that kind of ag tech space?  Yeah, it's a great question.  So in order to interpret an outcome, let's say we baseline soil carbon and then come  back five years and see how it changed.  We need to understand what happened on that field.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:30:30):**  And so we still need farm management data.  And so we're leveraging similar partners as we've worked with in our 2020 sourcing sustainability  commitment to say, yes, we're going to be measuring outcomes versus modeling outcomes.  And it's a costly and not scalable approach now, but we're looking at technology to help  us reduce costs and measure whole watersheds or whole regions.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:30:53):**  That's part of what our tech team is working on.  But we need to understand how those practices evolved over time.  Because to just have two data points but not a whole lot of understanding of what changed  isn't super helpful.  So it still requires that we get farm level detail.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:12):**  And I know there's sensitivity in sharing field information or farm level detail with  food companies and downstream supply chain actors and how we've been able to get producers  comfortable with that as our pilots really focus on one or two fields.  So we're not asking them for their full farm P&L.  We're just saying, hey, for these fields, the intent is that we're going to develop  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:33):**  a little bit of a report and case study at the end of the day.  So you can say, for these fields, I know what my profitability was.  I know what the soil health was and soil health metrics, how they changed.  I understood what kind of biodiversity was present at the beginning and how that evolved  over the time, what the impacts were to water.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:49):**  So yeah, we rely on some of these different companies that have tech or software solutions  that are already working with producers and their data.  I've connected them in with some of our pilots to ensure that we can interpret the results  that we have if we're making these investments over a three to five-year time period.  Some of that same tech, I think, there's promise in more remote sensing, thinking about using  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:32:16):**  satellite imagery to look at, be able to detect no-till in cover crops and a broad swath of  acres for a whole region.  We've done some of those tests with different partners out there.  If you add a soil carbon model to that, you can estimate soil carbon change on thousands  of million acres in a specific region of focus for us.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:32:37):**  We've done that already.  So that's where ag tech is interesting.  There's also some really interesting innovations to think about passive collection of insect  biodiversity with cameras and infrared.  There's great tech emerging that I think will enable more of this progress and acceleration.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:32:57):**  But I think that some of the best tech is in nature and in farmers' minds and their  approach.  We can just tweak the approach and the mindset and then also help producers see that if they're  farming in concert with nature and take some of nature's principles and applying to their  operation that that's going to out-compete some of the tech that's out there and in a  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:33:22):**  lot of cases might be more profitable too.  It's not easy and it's a journey for sure for a lot of producers who want to go down  this path.  But some of the best tech is proven and it lives out in nature.  Amazing, Jay.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:33:37):**  Thank you so much.  It's a super complex space and really great to see the downstream views on this and actually  how much of it is producer-centric as opposed to consumer-focused or kind of marketing-oriented.  I wasn't sure how that would land but that's been really encouraging for me and hopefully  for many of the producers listening.  
**[0:33:58-0:33:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:33:58):**  Yeah.  And I just think any producer that's listening I think would acknowledge that this is a producer-led  movement and we just want to do what we can to fuel some of this fire and be an enabler.  And thanks for the opportunity to be able to share a little bit about what we're doing  and why we're excited about regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:34:18):**  So that's a wrap on episode three in our Regen Ag series.

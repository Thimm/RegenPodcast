**[0:00:35-0:00:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:00:35):**  corn and oats.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:00:37):**  In 2015, he moved to an oat sourcing role, where he saw the launch of their oat sustainability

**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:00:44):**  And then in 2017, Jay joined the sustainability team across all priority ingredient categories  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:00:50):**  for General Mills, where recently they've begun to focus on soil health and ultimately

**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:00:58):**  Here's Jay Watson.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:01:00):**  I was given the opportunity to come to the sustainability full time to work across all  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:01:05):**  of our 10 priority ingredient categories in 2017.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:01:09):**  And so I've been on the team for about three years.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:01:12):**  Some of that focus on continuous improvement and efficiency and sustainability has pivoted  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:01:19):**  in the last few years to identifying that soil health is really a key unlock and soil

**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:01:29):**  is that 2030 commitment to advance regenerative agriculture on a million acres.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:01:35):**  I imagine most listeners are familiar with at least some of the General Mills brands.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:01:40):**  They produce and market more than 100 brands in more than 100 countries on six continents.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:01:46):**  You might recognize names like Betty Crocker, Hamburger Helper, Pillsbury Refrigerated Dough

**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:01:59):**  when I was a kid, Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:02:07):**  The lion's share of our business globally is in North America, but we do have operations  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:02:12):**  in many other countries, not as maybe as large of a global player as some of our peers in  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:02:18):**  the space, but we're big buyers of grain and dairy, as you can imagine with things like  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:02:24):**  cereal and snacks, Haagen-Dazs, ice cream, Yolkley yogurt.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:02:29):**  We have a big meals and baking portfolio, so big purchasers of wheat.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:02:34):**  Again, my oat sourcing experience has spent a lot of time with our Cheerios organization  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:02:39):**  and also in Nature Valley.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:02:41):**  Also had a chance to have a few conversations with Uncle Toby's down in Australia, but it

**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:02:49):**  We have fruits, vegetables, nuts, animal proteins based on the different products we market  
**[0:02:55-0:02:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:02:55):**  in different countries around the globe.

**[0:03:01-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:03:01):**  I spend some part of my days working on grains in North America, and I might be talking about  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:03:08):**  dairy in France, and then another part of the day might be onto cocoa or vanilla in  
**[0:03:13-0:03:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:03:13):**  our sustainability programs there, which are very focused on smallholder farmers and their

**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:03:41):**  assessment to understand, based on what we purchased and where those items were coming  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:03:47):**  from, what sustainability risks and opportunities were present.  
**[0:03:52-0:04:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:03:52):**  Out of that assessment came our 2020 Sustainable Sourcing Commitment that we announced in 2013.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:04:00):**  Oats is one of those categories, so just connecting back to some of my experience.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:04:03):**  I'm going to try to get all 10 of them.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:04:07):**  Oats, U.S. wheat, dry-milled corn in the United States, sugar beets, sugar cane, dairy, fiber  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:04:16):**  packaging, palm oil, vanilla, and cocoa.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:04:19):**  Those are the 10 categories that we set a commitment for for 2020, so this is a big  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:04:24):**  year for that reason.

**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:04:37):**  Given the range in the commodities on this list, General Mills has had to use different  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:04:42):**  strategies and definitions for sustainability.

**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:05:05):**  as continuous improvement over time against environmental metrics.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:05:11):**  Taking something like yield and flipping it to the inverse to say, how much land does

**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:05:23):**  over time.

**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:05:40):**  The other, cocoa and vanilla, there's different definitions and approaches for those types

**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:05:50):**  of those goals is not a straightforward task or commitment to make.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:05:55):**  I actually reviewed a number of food companies' sustainability plans.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:06:00):**  It was around in 2013, 2014, I think, just when you guys had made this commitment.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:06:05):**  It struck me how different everyone's approach was and seemingly how different the drivers  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:06:10):**  might be for different companies.

**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:13:39):**  It sounds like, and tell me if I'm wrong, Jay, in summarizing here that the initial

**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:14:06):**  Yeah, I'd say it's true, I'd add maybe one piece.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:14:10):**  The work started in our own manufacturing facilities before sourcing, right?  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:14:14):**  So working on energy efficiencies or cutting out waste, things that we could control, right?  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:14:20):**  And so that work's still going on today, right?  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:14:23):**  But I think some of the insights as part of our enterprise footprint effort was that from

**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:14:34):**  emissions if we look from farm all the way to ford to landfill.

**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:14:43):**  a real impact and reduce our footprint, we need to go and fish where the fish are.

**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:14:51):**  And not just from an emissions standpoint, but also we think about our water usage, you

**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:16:04):**  side in terms of that term and or those, you know, set of practices and principles?  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:16:09):**  Yeah, I'll address the consumer piece first.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:16:12):**  I mean, I don't think there was a lot of consumer communication or focus on that, at least initially,  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:16:17):**  because I think we needed to figure out more about soil health and what it could mean and  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:16:22):**  how we could activate some different things within our key sourcing regions.

**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:16:30):**  talking about it.

**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:18:09):**  might I look into something like no till because I'm going to be burning less diesel, but probably  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:18:13):**  in some cases, not necessarily connecting that to soil health.

**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:18:39):**  as we think about enabling this movement, given that we know no one farm is the same  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:18:43):**  as another.

**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:18:50):**  and the practices that might work in one area aren't actually the ones that would work in

**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:19:24):**  It just is dependent on this, the product and the supply chain, the region, the kind  
**[0:19:30-0:19:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:19:30):**  of producer readiness.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:19:31):**  Again, in some of those brands where we're marketing it, there's different contracts  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:19:35):**  in place.

**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:19:46):**  kind of evolution in their approach and mindset to managing farm.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:19:51):**  And so it's more education, training and technical assistance, one-on-one coaching, and that's  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:19:57):**  funded by General Mills.

**[0:20:03-0:20:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:03):**  as we see that as being a really key gap.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:06):**  Because we hear from a lot of producers is, hey, you know what, I'm energized.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:11):**  I just went to a soil health conference or learned about regenerative ag from someone  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:14):**  and I got back to my farm and I'm just not sure where to start or what to do.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:20):**  Right?  
**[0:20:21-0:20:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:21):**  Because it is unique to their operation.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:22):**  And so what we've done to kind of fill some of that need is to partner with the Soil Health  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:27):**  Academy on the train and the education, but then also understanding ag, which is one of  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:33):**  Gabe Brown's consulting organizations where there's a, there's a regenerative ag consultant  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:39):**  that comes alongside a producer to say, okay, let's build a plan for your unique operation.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:44):**  And we're funding those producers in our programs for three years as part of our pilots.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:49):**  And so that's, you know, it's not a, it's not a financial assistance play where we're  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:52):**  providing cost share.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:54):**  We are doing that in some places, but we really view one of the key barriers is this, this  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:20:59):**  understanding of how the ecosystem could function and an understanding of how to apply regenerative  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:05):**  principles to a unique operation.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:07):**  So that's where we've chosen to make investments.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:10):**  And we've had pretty good interest from producers in the regions where we have pilots.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:14):**  I mean, say we've, we've always had more producers who want to be a part of the program than  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:18):**  we have funding for, which I guess is a good problem to have.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:22):**  And we're, and we're trying to figure out, right, like for that specific place, because  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:26):**  we are taking more of a place-based approach to try and understand the uniqueness of that  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:31):**  system and those producers in the program.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:33):**  Like what is it that they need?  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:35):**  We can believe that we know, but until we sit down and speak with them, they may not

**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:41):**  Maybe it is something different.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:42):**  What is the enabling environment look like for each place?

**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:51):**  may we move a little bit more of the funding or focus to social and cultural support or  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:55):**  financial cost share.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:21:58):**  Another key incentive that gets talked about in the sustainability space is premiums, actually  
**[0:22:03-0:22:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:22:03):**  paying the producer more for a certain practice or outcome.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:22:06):**  Jay says there are some challenges with this, especially for Regen Ag.

**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:22:16):**  to talk about it is a tough proposition, one that all farmers want.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:22:21):**  And I address the question all the time, if a consumer's not asking for it yet, it's not  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:22:27):**  to say we can't create demand because that's what we do as a food company.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:22:31):**  But regenerative ag is a tough thing to understand for many.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:22:34):**  And we have an opportunity to just to help people understand kind of like general farming

**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:22:45):**  farm as an ecosystem and being able to produce food while restoring the function of that

**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:22:58):**  we don't know how we're going to talk about it and drive value.

**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:23:27):**  something that's, I think, sometimes challenging to do, but putting our goals and interests  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:23:33):**  to the side a little bit and just really trying to understand what role can we best play to  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:23:38):**  accelerate this momentum that might already exist and to just meet producers where they're  
**[0:23:43-0:23:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:23:43):**  at.

**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:23:49):**  we have up online now.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:23:51):**  They are pilots because we're learning a lot.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:23:53):**  And I don't think we would say that we have it all figured out.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:23:57):**  And like I mentioned before, a big part of that learning is just learning from producers  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:02):**  and what's working, what's not.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:04):**  And so we're making sure to remind leaders internally at General Mills that this is something  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:10):**  we're piloting and we're going to need to be flexible and agile, but it's the right  
**[0:24:14-0:24:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:14):**  thing to do.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:15):**  And producers need support right now.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:17):**  And as a food company, we have a unique role to play where we can connect consumer to producer.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:24):**  But one of the other things we've done is really, I think, developed a unique experimental  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:29):**  design because a lot of the research in the agricultural space is fairly reductive.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:35):**  Let's control all things but one variable and see what the outcome of the change in  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:42):**  that practice is on a particular outcome.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:44):**  Well, that's not really how the systems work.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:48):**  They're living systems that are connected.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:50):**  And so we need to study the whole system.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:53):**  And so our research and the outcomes that we're measuring, our treatment for this research  
**[0:24:58-0:25:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:24:58):**  that we're doing is a farmer who has a regenerative education and support and who is bringing  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:05):**  a regenerative approach to their operation compared to a farm that's not.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:09):**  And there could be five things that that producer is changing.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:13):**  So we're not, you know, it might be hard to stomach for some, but we're not going to be  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:17):**  able to, we have a change in an outcome say in soil health.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:20):**  We're not going to be able to point to the one thing that drove that because it's not  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:24):**  one thing.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:25):**  It's a systems approach to managing the operation.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:28):**  And so that's a space that we've kind of plugged because some of the research institutions  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:33):**  in these regions, although some of the research may want to go there, I don't know that they're  
**[0:25:37-0:25:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:37):**  really set up to do that type of research.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:39):**  And so I think it's a place where we've been leading and so grateful to have a really strong  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:45):**  technical team on staff.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:47):**  I mean, what are the food companies have a PhD soil scientist, a couple other PhD agronomists,  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:52):**  like that's not really that common.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:25:55):**  So I'm so, so thankful that those are some of the peers I get to work with because I  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:00):**  want this work to be impactful for the producers, for General Mills, but I also want it to be  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:04):**  credible and to be supported by the best available science.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:07):**  Yeah, well that's right.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:08):**  The supply chain complexity and the farming systems complexity means that making some  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:15):**  kind of commitment to consumers is actually really difficult.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:19):**  And right now we often don't have the data or technologies to be able to say, yes, for  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:27):**  sure this much carbon was sequestered or this much soil health was improved or this much  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:33):**  regen was done because that's not even a concept that exists.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:36):**  And if it was, we wouldn't know what to measure and it would be different in different areas.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:40):**  And so I guess you end up or the fear maybe is that you end up with what a criticism of  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:46):**  regen might be, which is that it's kind of evangelical, that it's squishy and more about  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:52):**  a movement, which is a word that you used and doesn't have that science.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:56):**  And yet you've mentioned science and data a couple of times.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:26:58):**  So yeah, I guess what's your kind of response to maybe a criticism of regen that it's more  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:27:04):**  evangelical and not grounded in solid science or good farming practices?  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:27:08):**  Yeah, to those critics, I would just ask them to share what their definition of regenerative  
**[0:27:13-0:27:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:27:13):**  agriculture is because I think it varies and ours is focused on outcomes and you can't  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:27:20):**  really have an outcomes focused approach if you're not measuring outcomes with the best

**[0:27:32-0:27:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:27:32):**  natural, where it doesn't really mean anything.

**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:27:37):**  Like what does natural mean?  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:27:38):**  There's no standard, like organic, right?

**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:27:46):**  With regenerative agriculture, I mean, I think anybody who will listen and who's thinking  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:27:51):**  about making some sort of claim or just talking about regenerative agriculture as part of  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:27:56):**  their strategy, I'm really pushing them to say, you need to measure regeneration then.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:28:02):**  Because I think that's what makes it legitimate and different is that if we can measure soil  
**[0:28:07-0:28:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:28:07):**  health, also say aggregate stability or water infiltration or microbial activity or soil  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:28:15):**  organic matter, soil carbon, if we can show that those things got better over time, then  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:28:20):**  we can talk about how this farming approach regenerated soil.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:28:24):**  The same can be said for water, profitability, biodiversity.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:28:29):**  We just need to make sure that we have the right protocol to measure those things.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:28:33):**  So I'd say for companies or different organizations that are talking about regenerative ag, but  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:28:39):**  don't really have a measurement approach, yeah, I think in a lot of ways, regenerative  
**[0:28:43-0:28:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:28:43):**  ag is going to feel pretty squishy.

**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:29:26):**  And I think some of the criticism is from those that maybe are looking at regenerative  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:29:30):**  ag differently, defining it differently, and maybe don't understand all the different approaches

**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:29:46):**  that are building the research plans and protocols to say, how do we measure regeneration?  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:29:52):**  Because if we're going to say regenerative ag, we need to be able to point to something

**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:30:10):**  And if not yet, where are there opportunities in that kind of ag tech space?  
**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:30:15):**  Yeah, it's a great question.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:30:18):**  So in order to interpret an outcome, let's say we baseline soil carbon and then come  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:30:25):**  back five years and see how it changed.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:30:27):**  We need to understand what happened on that field.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:30:30):**  And so we still need farm management data.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:30:33):**  And so we're leveraging similar partners as we've worked with in our 2020 sourcing sustainability  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:30:38):**  commitment to say, yes, we're going to be measuring outcomes versus modeling outcomes.

**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:30:48):**  us reduce costs and measure whole watersheds or whole regions.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:30:53):**  That's part of what our tech team is working on.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:30:56):**  But we need to understand how those practices evolved over time.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:01):**  Because to just have two data points but not a whole lot of understanding of what changed  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:07):**  isn't super helpful.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:08):**  So it still requires that we get farm level detail.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:12):**  And I know there's sensitivity in sharing field information or farm level detail with  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:18):**  food companies and downstream supply chain actors and how we've been able to get producers  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:23):**  comfortable with that as our pilots really focus on one or two fields.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:27):**  So we're not asking them for their full farm P&L.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:29):**  We're just saying, hey, for these fields, the intent is that we're going to develop  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:33):**  a little bit of a report and case study at the end of the day.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:35):**  So you can say, for these fields, I know what my profitability was.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:39):**  I know what the soil health was and soil health metrics, how they changed.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:42):**  I understood what kind of biodiversity was present at the beginning and how that evolved

**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:55):**  that are already working with producers and their data.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/why-the-major-food-companies-are-supporting-regen-ag-with-jay-watson-of-general-mills#t=0:31:58):**  I've connected them in with some of our pilots to ensure that we can interpret the results

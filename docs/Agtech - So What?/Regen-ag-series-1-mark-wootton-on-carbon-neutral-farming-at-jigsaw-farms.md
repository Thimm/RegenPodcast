### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 15 Jul 2020 20:03:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast brought to you by Agthentic.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:00:07):**  As always, I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:00:10):**  Today's episode is the first in another series that we're doing, this time on regenerative  
**[0:00:16-0:00:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:00:16):**  agriculture.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:00:17):**  We'll be looking at this topic from a few different angles, sharing some pretty strong  
**[0:00:23-0:00:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:00:23):**  and hard won views.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:00:25):**  Today's guest is Mark Wooten of Jigsaw Farms, a very successful and well-known mixed farming  
**[0:00:31-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:00:31):**  operation in the southwest of Victoria.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:00:34):**  Mark is a pioneer in carbon neutral farming, but also a bit of a skeptic on the sometimes  
**[0:00:40-0:00:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:00:40):**  evangelical term regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:00:43):**  In our chat, Mark shares the drivers behind some tough decisions like moving away from  
**[0:00:48-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:00:48):**  mulesing, building flexibility into his operation, using EIDs on his sheep, and the sometimes  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:00:56):**  arduous and expensive path to carbon neutrality.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:01:00):**  Mark starts us off with his pretty unusual background.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:01:04):**  I was actually raised in South Korea in the 1960s.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:01:08):**  I just turned 60 a month ago, so that dates me.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:01:12):**  My parents were missionaries in South Korea, and as a very small child, no matter whichever  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:01:17):**  country we lived in, they'd always find me in a pig style, wherever the animals were.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:01:21):**  I was always heading towards ag, even though I have non-farming parents.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:01:25):**  I suppose that gave a strong emphasis for a social justice type background, having been  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:01:30):**  brought up in a missionary, although I'm actually an atheist.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:01:34):**  That imprinted on me, and then we moved all around different parts of the world.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:01:40):**  Then we settled in Melbourne for my secondary schooling.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:01:43):**  Once I finished that, I started working on farms and didn't have enough capital to get  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:01:49):**  started for what we wanted to do, so I realized I had to get another income.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:01:54):**  I went back to university when I was 23 and did a geography degree and ended up teaching  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:00):**  for 10 years, secondary here and in Africa, actually.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:04):**  While in Melbourne, Mark and his wife Eve started the family.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:07):**  At one time, they had four kids under six years old.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:11):**  But the pull to get into agriculture never went away.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:15):**  We always had small properties in Gippsland when we were teaching and stuff, just running  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:19):**  villas and a few sheep.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:22):**  Then we decided to go over scale.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:23):**  We came, we were very fortunate.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:25):**  We came up here in 1996.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:27):**  We started purchasing and bought all our land pre the MIS blue gum schemes.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:32):**  We were fortunate that we could buy large swaths of land at relatively low cost.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:38):**  We had a very simple formula.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:40):**  We realized to be within two hours of a capital city was going to knock us out from being  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:45):**  competitive at a scalable agriculture level.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:49):**  We were always attracted, obviously, to grazing and livestock.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:53):**  The choices chose themselves to be frank with you.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:56):**  Right.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:02:57):**  I've got a million questions, all of which is how you became an atheist, but I suppose  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:01):**  we can save that for maybe a different podcast or a chat over a beverage.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:07):**  When you, I guess, tell me about the operation today, give us a bit of a picture of where  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:13):**  it's at.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:14):**  We shrunk slightly a few years ago when I had a health issue.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:18):**  I had a heart operation.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:21):**  After that, we made a decision that we had to make a sustainable lifestyle.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:24):**  We got to about 16,500 acres.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:27):**  We're employing nine people and running about 35,000 ewes and nearly up to about 1600 breeding  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:34):**  cattle.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:36):**  We made a decision when land prices improved that part of our succession farm plan was  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:40):**  to shrink, which was slightly unusual when everyone else was growing.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:45):**  But we still have significant size.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:47):**  Today, the farm is about eight and a half thousand acres across two blocks.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:51):**  But despite changes in size, their focus at the core remains the same.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:56):**  We grow grass.  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:57):**  It's that simple.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:03:58):**  Since we purchased the properties, we've measured the outcome.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:04:02):**  We've doubled the food and fibre on a per hectare basis off all the properties we've  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:04:06):**  bought and in some instances three or four times.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:04:09):**  We're a high input system, so we use fertiliser strategically and in quite a precision way.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:04:16):**  We have sort of eight different blends going out.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:04:19):**  And we've come back to where we stabilise.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:04:22):**  We join 20,000 merino ewes to either a terminal sire or for self replacing.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:04:29):**  We've got good fertility now, mainly through selecting for muscle and fat.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:04:34):**  And we've got that, what are we carving down?  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:04:37):**  I think we're carving down 690 crossbred cattle as well.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:04:41):**  So that keeps us busy.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:04:44):**  Over time, Mark has made a lot of non-traditional and in some cases, perhaps controversial decisions  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:04:50):**  on the farm.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:04:52):**  This year we'll have ceased all mulesing.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:04:54):**  And we did a number of years as a transition.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:04:57):**  We did the cryogenetic freeze branding as a transitional technology, which we finished  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:05:02):**  using last year because we're happy with where genetically we're at.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:05:06):**  There are a few reasons Mark decided to go down this path, a path that involved a range  
**[0:05:10-0:05:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:05:10):**  of technologies.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:05:11):**  Well, it was twofold really.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:05:13):**  One was, I suppose the pull factor was there was a market premium for completely non-treated,  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:05:21):**  including freeze branding product like the ZQ program for the wolf.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:05:26):**  And there was also a push factor that we were happy that we can manage the risk of not having  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:05:33):**  any treatment in terms of the breach of the animal.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:05:36):**  After moving through the freeze branding gave us a fair bit of protection and safety until  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:05:41):**  we were confident that genetically we were strong enough that the sheep were plain enough  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:05:45):**  that we weren't at a high risk.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:05:47):**  We're still at risk from fly, but we've also got the technology.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:05:52):**  We've got an electrode type system, which isn't that fancy, but it means that we can  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:05:56):**  process if we have to jet ship very quickly in large numbers.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:06:00):**  So the original driver was there's a premium out there and then you figured out how to  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:06:04):**  make it work.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:06:05):**  Is that right?  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:06:06):**  No, the original driver was probably not either of those things.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:06:09):**  The original driver was an animal welfare basis.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:06:12):**  We really were unhappy with mulesing and we also, we could smell the smoke coming.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:06:20):**  We started selecting genetically for non-mule sheep 2010.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:06:27):**  So we're on that 10 year line now of doing it.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:06:32):**  One of our previous podcast guests, Mark Ferg Ferguson, back in episode 60 actually played  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:06:37):**  a role in Jigsaw's transition away from mulesing, helping especially on the genetic side.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:06:43):**  But like many adopters of technologies and new practices, it wasn't something that Mark  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:06:48):**  just jumped into in one go.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:06:50):**  He had a plan and made small measured changes over time.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:06:54):**  I've looked pretty heavily at some of the market forces that are at play.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:06:59):**  Whether it's a social license or whether it's a price premium, I think the two tend to run  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:07:02):**  together because one may reflect others or there might be a time lag between the two.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:07:07):**  But we also had the practicality of actually running a decent sized commercial flock with  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:07:12):**  risk of flies in an Australian environment, when we felt that confidence going forward,  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:07:19):**  we obviously did it.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:07:20):**  We've done trials every year where it isn't like we've just gone wholesale bang.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:07:25):**  And this last year we ceased at the Helmdoo, the Melbourne Forest properties completely  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:07:31):**  and treatment.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:07:32):**  And we got through the summer and we were pretty confident.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:07:36):**  And then this year we've decided to do the whole thing, whereas we're not actually doing  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:07:39):**  it at all in terms of the freeze branding.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:07:43):**  We have a mules to sheep here for nearly coming up to our fifth year.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:07:49):**  So we haven't done a mules since then.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:07:51):**  So there'd be one age group, maybe one and a half age groups, if that makes sense, that  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:07:57):**  have got mules on them on the property and that would be it.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:08:01):**  Another pretty big initiative that Mark has taken on at Jigsaw is going carbon neutral.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:08:05):**  Again, I was interested in the drivers.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:08:08):**  What made Mark decide to go down this path?  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:08:11):**  Well I chaired the Climate Institute for 12 years from 2005.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:08:17):**  And it was Sydney based and I spent a lot of my life going back and forth to there,  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:08:20):**  which probably wasn't good for my carbon footprint.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:08:22):**  And I was heavily involved in looking at some of the problems, but some of the solutions  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:08:29):**  to do with climate change.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:08:32):**  And it became pretty self-evident that as a community we needed to act and as a world,  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:08:38):**  as a globe we needed to act, but also as individuals we needed to act.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:08:42):**  And so it seemed somewhat hypocritical if we were meat producers here, which have got  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:08:47):**  a fair carbon footprint on them, that we didn't actually look at how we manage our own farms  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:08:53):**  in that context.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:08:54):**  We've always been heavily into shelter belts and trees and agroforestry for high value  
**[0:09:01-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:09:01):**  saw log production.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:09:03):**  And so Melbourne Uni actually approached us and we worked with them on doing a full audit  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:09:09):**  of our carbon footprint using predominantly grass grow models.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:09:13):**  But it was a quite exhausting one.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:09:15):**  It's actually been peer reviewed and published through CSIRO paper now.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:09:19):**  And we achieved carbon neutrality here in 2011.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:09:24):**  And that's predominantly by having about 18% of the farms down to trees for saw logs or  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:09:30):**  for permanent revegetation shelter belts.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:09:33):**  And so the motivation was there, but we had to say, I think we're there and using some  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:09:38):**  of the perhaps the simpler tools, but not quite as accurate tools, we went through the  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:09:43):**  full process.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:09:44):**  I would not encourage anyone to do it.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:09:47):**  It's a quite an arduous process and not necessarily a commercial reward one.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:09:52):**  Yeah, that's what I was going to ask about because it sounds like the audit, the initial  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:09:57):**  verification, the baselining and even some of those practices can potentially be seen  
**[0:10:03-0:10:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:03):**  as detrimental to profits.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:05):**  How do you think about the kind of return on investment of these kinds of programs and  
**[0:10:09-0:10:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:09):**  practices?  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:10):**  Yeah, well, I mean, I think you have to look into the whole systems perspective.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:13):**  I mean, in terms of whole farm planning, I always say, you know, like we've been obviously  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:20):**  been doing it for quite a few years now, but we've had when we have a tour group of people  
**[0:10:24-0:10:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:24):**  come through and they go, well, what should I do?  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:27):**  How do I do it?  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:28):**  Well, I say make a plan and then in some good years you can invest in it and some years  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:32):**  you can't.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:33):**  And you need to understand where you're going in terms of your plan.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:37):**  And that may be generational that they get to that plan.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:39):**  It may not even be in that generation, but just make sure that what you're doing won't  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:43):**  have to be undone by someone else further along the line.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:47):**  And from a whole systems point of view, I think that's what we did our decisions on.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:51):**  I mean, we were first and foremost, we value biodiversity.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:56):**  My wife's a really keen bird nut.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:10:59):**  We started here with our bird surveys in the beginning in 96, having 48 bird surveys, and  
**[0:11:04-0:11:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:11:04):**  now we've got 160, sorry, 48 bird species, and now we have 164 bird species.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:11:11):**  And that's a very good environmental indicator of what we're doing.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:11:15):**  In terms of your other question, in terms of the economic reward, well, we're in a strong  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:11:20):**  position really, where if we do elect to actually sell our product through a carbon neutral  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:11:24):**  scheme, which is a scalability is our issue because how do you do it?  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:11:29):**  We're in a strong position where we can put our hands in our hearts and quite legitimately  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:11:33):**  say, well, here's a study that Syro is peer reviewed.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:11:36):**  There's rigor in the system, but there's also, you sleep pretty good at night.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:11:41):**  And we produce in these, in Australian context, about 10% of our greenhouse gases are produced  
**[0:11:46-0:11:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:11:46):**  by ruminant animals.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:11:47):**  Sheep are about 4% of the total footprint.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:11:50):**  And in that context, it's a really useful thing that we can say, well, we've got part  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:11:56):**  of the solution worked out.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:11:57):**  Although I should say for, I think the solution for most people isn't the trees.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:12:02):**  I think most of it's going to be about feed efficiency and looking at a ruminant change  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:12:07):**  going forward, whether that's using feeds or whether it's using some of the inhibitor  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:12:12):**  or some of the injections that you could use going forward.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:12:16):**  And so when you, I guess, just to break that down a little bit.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:12:19):**  So you guys did it because it was, you felt the right thing to do.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:12:24):**  And when the uni came along to do that initial audit, did they, like, is that something you  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:12:29):**  had to pay for and you kind of sunk a cost into this knowing that there would eventually  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:12:33):**  be a benefit or?  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:12:34):**  No, no, they, they were pretty keen to do it too because we didn't know in a high rainfall  
**[0:12:38-0:12:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:12:38):**  area, they didn't know how it would work.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:12:40):**  I mean, part of the thing was just straight inquisitiveness, to be honest with you.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:12:44):**  Like, you know, we, we, we thought we were going to be there, but by the time you put  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:12:47):**  your energy and your fuel and your, and you're looking at, for us, like in a, in the drought  
**[0:12:53-0:12:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:12:53):**  period in 2005 and 2006, we had to move down.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:12:56):**  We had 2,600 breeders on this one block, which we had to take account for from a methane  
**[0:13:01-0:13:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:01):**  point of view.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:02):**  And if you actually ever looked at the graph, you've got this, this amazing rise at that  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:06):**  period and you had to end it.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:07):**  But that's real farming.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:08):**  You know, real farming is movement and trading and bringing things in and some good years  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:14):**  and some bad years and you know, where you need to, you've got excess feed and you've  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:18):**  got a not enough feed and, and, and all of that had to be done over a number of years.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:23):**  So they were pretty keen to do it as well.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:25):**  So, and they've now, they've now working with the MLA, the beef farmers, they've got, they're  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:32):**  running out of much simpler form using some of the stuff we use for 50 different farms  
**[0:13:37-0:13:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:37):**  in Australia.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:38):**  So again, that's a much easier tool for people to do.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:42):**  And the challenge now is, is for the sheep industry, to be honest, is to hook into it.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:46):**  And there's no, there's no arguments in the sheep industry.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:48):**  Well, there's probably is that I don't hear, but you know, most people in the sheep industry  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:52):**  are happy to understand at least what the problem is.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:56):**  And so it's just a question of us actually getting the data.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:13:59):**  When you say the problem, you mean in terms of emissions or what do you mean by the problem?  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:14:03):**  Do I understand what the, so, so, you know, if, if, you know, well, MLA have signed off  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:14:07):**  a 2030 red meat industry in Australia will be carbon neutral.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:14:11):**  Well, between you and I, we've got pretty, 10 pretty tough years to achieve that.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:14:18):**  It's not, you know, there's actually today the beef sustainability framework releases  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:14:23):**  their annual data coming forward.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:14:24):**  And, and they're talking about a drop in emissions again and the drop going forward.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:14:30):**  But what they, what they sneakily declined to say is, is the herd size struck.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:14:35):**  That's the biggest driver of dropping our emissions in Australia at the moment is that  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:14:39):**  we don't have as many mouths around and we've been through a massive drought period through  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:14:42):**  large swarms of the country that grow beef.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:14:46):**  So you know, just to be frank with you, it is a challenge.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:14:50):**  One of the areas Mark is looking to next is on the feed side, both reducing emissions  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:14:55):**  and improving feed efficiency.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:14:57):**  We've got a opportunist feedlot containment area here where we hold about anywhere up  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:15:03):**  to 7,000 lambs.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:15:05):**  We can do a fair bit of measurement now, particularly with having an EID system where we can measure  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:15:10):**  growth per animal.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:15:12):**  And we can look at some of these inhibitors, food we put into the mixes, whether it's a  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:15:17):**  seaweed based one or whatever, which, which, which can change the methane behaviour.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:15:21):**  And quite positively putting aside that even if you're a dis, you know, you don't accept  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:15:25):**  any of the climate change or any of the social license argument, if it's about feed efficiency  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:15:31):**  and you can put more kilos on per animal for the mouth feed you put down the throat, that's  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:15:35):**  going to be pretty attractive to people I think.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:15:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:15:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:15:39):**  I guess that's, that's what I was trying to get my head around Mark is if you broke up  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:15:42):**  the, the, or categorize the different changes you've made, what's the breakdown between  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:15:47):**  didn't know, but we're just curious versus thought there would be a environmental or  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:15:53):**  kind of societal benefit, even if it would be a cost to the bottom line versus thought  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:15:57):**  there'd be a premium versus thought there'd be a private benefit as in, you know, you,  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:16:03):**  you guys would make more money or get more profit, not through a premium or a scheme,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:16:06):**  but because it's just better, better practices.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:16:08):**  I guess if there's those four categories, how does it break down in terms of what were  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:16:12):**  the drivers?  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:16:13):**  It's a very, very good, very difficult question Sarah.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:16:18):**  I'm both, I'm trying to, yeah, oversimplifying or overcompeting.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:16:24):**  To be honest with you, if I was going to be honest with you, it's probably all of those  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:16:27):**  things and it's all changed over time.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:16:30):**  I mean, you know, like there are times when you do things for the pure, if we'd had good  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:16:34):**  years and financially we could afford to go a bit harder in terms of you know, doing offset  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:16:40):**  trees or the, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm a wood nut too.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:16:44):**  I love timber.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:16:45):**  So, you know, the sawlog timbers have an intrinsic value, but also an economic value.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:16:49):**  I mean the, our trees, when we harvest them after a 25 year rotation, are going to challenge  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:16:54):**  any of the sheep production for returns.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:16:56):**  I mean, they're going to be over $20,000 net return per hectare.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:17:01):**  But the problem is you have no income in that 20 year, 25 year block.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:17:05):**  So, you know, it's all about having that within the landscape.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:17:08):**  So when we put those trees in, they were based on the desire to have a diverse income, superannuation  
**[0:17:15-0:17:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:17:15):**  outcomes, succession planning, all those number type things, but they're also, we like trees.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:17:22):**  So, you know, that's using two of those four categories in that decision.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:17:26):**  In terms of some of the, say the carbon neutrality expectation, well, we didn't have the technologies  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:17:32):**  where we could reduce the methane on those animals.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:17:35):**  Although we did recognise by running a higher input system, this is one of the challenge  
**[0:17:41-0:17:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:17:41):**  for some of the regen ag people, by actually producing your emissions intensity per kilos  
**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:17:48):**  produced as a measurement tool, these high input systems very often outgun them on their  
**[0:17:54-0:17:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:17:54):**  methane.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:17:55):**  You know, if you've got an extensive low input system, you need to somehow equate that methane  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:18:02):**  per kilo, whether it's per lamb or per wool kilo, whatever the criteria you're using.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:18:08):**  And that's one of the challenges.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:18:09):**  So we were confident that by doing that, by being economies of scale and being highly  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:18:15):**  efficient, we were going to make money out of it, it was going to do it, but at the same  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:18:19):**  time we were conscious that it had to reduce that carbon loading per kilo.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:18:23):**  So again, that's two of your categories.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:18:26):**  And in my brain, when we were talking about it, I'm not sure how I separate that, to be  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:18:30):**  honest with you.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:18:31):**  It sounds like not much of it though was in the market premium or kind of some other reward  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:18:38):**  category.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:18:39):**  I think the discretionary market premiums, there's a little bit in wool, we've done a  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:18:43):**  little bit there with some carbon neutral products going through where we had to track  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:18:47):**  them from farm gate to, it was a quothra, it was a sportswear brand hitting an Italian  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:18:54):**  shop and we had to do an offset there and that was to understand it.  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:18:57):**  But it was tickling on the edges.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:18:59):**  It's not a serious one there.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:19:02):**  The language now is that consumers post COVID are going to probably are going to be a lot  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:19:08):**  more discretionary, understanding the wool market I'm reading now is there's people are  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:19:14):**  going to buy less wool, they're going to buy better wool, they're going to buy what's it  
**[0:19:18-0:19:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:19:18):**  called ageless fashion items, all of that, which is, you know, if that comes to fruition,  
**[0:19:25-0:19:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:19:25):**  then I think we will be in a strong position.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:19:26):**  So the other half of the question, which you sort of inferred without asking directly is  
**[0:19:33-0:19:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:19:33):**  it also protects us in these markets going forward.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:19:36):**  So even though the opportunity isn't perhaps there now for the market premium, there's  
**[0:19:40-0:19:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:19:40):**  a little bit on the fringes, there is a market premium on animal welfare issues, just look  
**[0:19:47-0:19:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:19:47):**  at ZQ.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:19:48):**  I mean, that's a pretty straightforward one there.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:19:50):**  There's a clear market premium.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:19:52):**  But on those other aspects, say it's a biodiversity question, you know, whether it's a naturalness,  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:19:57):**  which is one of the other categories, which I never quite understand what it means, or  
**[0:20:00-0:20:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:20:00):**  whether it's on a carbon basis, those markets going forward are not going to disappear.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:20:08):**  They can only grow, but how much are they going to grow by?  
**[0:20:11-0:20:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:20:11):**  I don't know.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:20:12):**  But by doing what we did again, and that whole systems approach and on a whole farm basis,  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:20:16):**  I think we've set ourselves up to have more opportunities to enter those markets than  
**[0:20:20-0:20:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:20:20):**  if we didn't.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:20:22):**  So it's sort of a double negative, really, isn't it?  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:20:24):**  We did it because what could happen, but it may not happen.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:20:28):**  But the trends are pretty, I'm a trend person, I look at trends.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:20:32):**  You mentioned Regen Ag, the narrative can sometimes be really oversimplified, right?  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:20:38):**  Well, if we just farmed better, then consumers were rewarded, and we could save the environment,  
**[0:20:43-0:20:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:20:43):**  and why doesn't everyone just do it?  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:20:44):**  And we'll call it regenerative, and everyone will be happy.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:20:47):**  And I think that misses all of the nuances that you've just started to get into.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:20:52):**  Well, there's an implication too, that to be brutal, is what we're doing is not regenerative.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:20:56):**  I mean, if you look at our carbon stores, which we measure rigorously, we get to about  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:01):**  4%, and then it doesn't move much at all from then.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:04):**  So then they say, oh, you got to look at your soil biologies, and you're going to have to  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:07):**  look at rotation.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:08):**  Well, we rotationally graze, we do a range of different grazing systems, and we just  
**[0:21:12-0:21:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:12):**  can't move it.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:13):**  Our biggest change in getting locked in carbon here was not using fertiliser, it was going  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:19):**  to a perennial system.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:20):**  As soon as we went to a perennial system away from using annuals, we started locking carbon  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:25):**  up.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:26):**  And I would argue that by us doubling the, you know, our farms here are double the district  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:32):**  average in terms of carrying capacity.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:34):**  And that means that A, we can do the offsets with the trees and still make good money.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:39):**  Our profitability here is, you know, we'll be frank, we've had on average an over 10%  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:45):**  net return every year.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:46):**  And part of that is capital gain built into it because it's gone off.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:49):**  It's actually a lot higher than that at the moment, but that's a falsity because our land  
**[0:21:52-0:21:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:52):**  price has just gone ballistic of late because of the security of water we have here.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:21:59):**  But you know, I mean, it's a robust system, which is, you know, like if we are going to  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:22:04):**  feed 10 million people in the world and we are going to have to produce protein for them,  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:22:10):**  regen ag's not going to cut it.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:22:12):**  It's just not going to be able to do it.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:22:13):**  It's not going to have the, we're going to have to look at some of the more intense systems  
**[0:22:17-0:22:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:22:17):**  being kinder to the environment, having a higher level of social license in terms of  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:22:23):**  whether it's a toxicity, you know, with their pesticides or whether it's water usage or  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:22:27):**  whether it's a carbon conversion, whatever criteria you use, we're going to have to get  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:22:31):**  good at this.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:22:32):**  And I find the, you've asked my question before, you're interested why I'm an atheist.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:22:38):**  Well, I'm an atheist when it comes to regen ag.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:22:41):**  I think that that is an evangelical movement.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:22:44):**  I mean, I think that they need to come up with the science and I keep, they keep coming  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:22:48):**  and I keep saying, send me the science that shows me peer reviewed science, that shows  
**[0:22:52-0:22:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:22:52):**  me the outcome.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:22:53):**  And not one of them has produced it yet, not one.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:22:56):**  And they also, they can't do it because of the money in the, and that's in the big ag.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:23:00):**  Well, they, they need to get their act together because it's, it's, it's a distraction as  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:23:05):**  far as I'm concerned to where the industry should be moving.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:23:09):**  It's really interesting because in some ways, if you step back and look at the principles  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:23:15):**  of regenerative ag, one of which might be not in, not in any kind of doctrinal sense,  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:23:20):**  but in a, what we want for the outcome or what they, they or whoever it is, what regen  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:23:24):**  wants for the outcome, you know, carbon neutral, I imagine, and high animal welfare are two  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:23:29):**  that are high in the top three or five or two.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:23:33):**  And so in some ways you're, I guess, do you think it's a labeling question?  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:23:37):**  Like you're already doing it.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:23:38):**  You're getting the outcomes, but they've either over or under prescribed the practices to  
**[0:23:43-0:23:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:23:43):**  get there.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:23:44):**  And that's where the challenge is.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:23:45):**  Well, that was interesting.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:23:47):**  As before we got the Corona, the Rhona goddess, I was going to talk about Lamex on, and they  
**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:23:53):**  said on regen ag.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:23:56):**  And there was a presumption that I'd actually have a crack at them, which I would have,  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:00):**  but my opening was going to be pretty simple.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:03):**  I'm a regenerative agricultural participant here, and I don't like that name being taken  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:09):**  away from what we do.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:10):**  And you just, because you use that name regularly, you need to define and prove and support your  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:15):**  cause.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:16):**  If you, and then they'll go off on tangents.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:17):**  I'll go, okay, well, let's talk about carbon.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:18):**  I'll go bang, bang.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:20):**  Let's talk about biodiversity.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:21):**  And we've got so much data on biodiversity because we've had, you know, Deakin, you and  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:25):**  everyone's done every water invertebrate and every bloody thing coming through here in  
**[0:24:29-0:24:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:29):**  terms of measurement.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:30):**  And it's what we do is clearly positive for the environment in any sense of the word.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:36):**  And I would challenge even some of those regen people to come and beat our data in terms  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:40):**  of outcome to the environment or outcome in terms of native flora or fauna, whatever the  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:45):**  criteria they use.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:47):**  And yet we can still produce double the amount of food and fibre and not damage the environment.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:53):**  Clearly not.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:54):**  We are regenerating what was here in a cleared landscape full of onion grass.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:24:58):**  You know, I mean, the language is, you know, they take the space and all of a sudden that  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:03):**  becomes, well, they must be doing regeneration because they're using the term.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:07):**  And I challenge them that that's not right.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:10):**  We are, I am regenerating our agricultural landscape here.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:15):**  You mentioned the, I mean, I guess one thing that strikes me is how complex the measures  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:21):**  are and what you're doing.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:22):**  Like if you went to someone who's doing some of these things or, or, or not any of them  
**[0:25:27-0:25:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:27):**  and said, you know, we've got to get biodiversity here and carbon to here.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:30):**  And even if you had all the measurements and someone believed in the philosophy of getting  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:34):**  there and saw the profitability, like there's still a gap in how you would do that, possibly  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:40):**  even a worse before better in terms of like how you would like, it's expensive to measure  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:44):**  that stuff.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:45):**  Some of those changes might cost the bottom line on the way.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:48):**  How do you think about getting more people there?  
**[0:25:51-0:25:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:51):**  And I think that's where as an industry, we probably need to simplify the system.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:54):**  And that's why when Richard Eckhart's working with MLA on these 50 ready recorders for your  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:25:59):**  carbon footprint with 50 practical beef farmers, I think that's great because they'll push  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:26:05):**  back.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:26:06):**  They'll have robust data.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:26:07):**  If they can't, if you can't sit down with a tool and enter it in on a Excel type approach,  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:26:13):**  it might not be Excel, but type approach, and you can't put your data in there in a  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:26:18):**  day, people are not going to take it up.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:26:21):**  It has to be a practical thing and then it has to be robust to be defensible that to  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:26:26):**  the industry that this has been done properly.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:26:29):**  And I mean, that's the same with all the animal welfare and all the QA stuff we do.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:26:33):**  We need to be able to show that we are euthanaging.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:26:37):**  We're about to start using numb nuts for when we mark the lands, for example.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:26:42):**  And we will be able to go and we'll go, if you want us to test, here's the receipt, here's  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:26:46):**  the of what we've done.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:26:47):**  And that's the rigor we need to do in the system and the QA.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:26:50):**  But it has to be done.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:26:52):**  And maybe with the biodiversity side, you pick two or three indicators.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:26:55):**  I mean, birds Australia are now running all these little transects all around Australia  
**[0:27:00-0:27:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:00):**  on all these different farms with enormous amount of data, which is just using predominantly  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:08):**  competent but amateur birdwatches.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:11):**  And if you get enough data, it becomes robust.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:14):**  I mean, you're not going to, I mean, you have someone dodgy in there saying they've seen  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:18):**  X or Y.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:19):**  If it's repeatability and you do it every three months and it's in this area, that's  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:23):**  a good one.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:24):**  So farmers could use that.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:26):**  I challenged Mark a bit on this because I guess I'm still a little bit skeptical about  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:30):**  building a tool that's both comprehensive enough to stack up on the science and still  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:36):**  easy to use for farmers.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:38):**  Even if it was the simplest Excel tool to measure all the, you've got 17 of them, you've  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:42):**  got the biodiversity one, you've got the carbon one, you've got the welfare one, and there's  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:45):**  this scheme for this state and this scheme for that state.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:48):**  And if none of them are giving you a reward today, I struggle to see why anyone, even  
**[0:27:54-0:27:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:54):**  if they're the simplest tools, why anyone fills them out.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:27:57):**  Well I suppose it gets back to your motivation and why you farm, but I mean, I think a lot  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:02):**  of farmers are naturally quite inquisitive.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:04):**  It's a strange industry really.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:06):**  We're competitors with each other, but we're great collaborators with each other.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:10):**  We're involved in the New Zealand farm mapping exercise.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:15):**  We're doing the grazing program now and to do that, we need to get better with our rigour  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:21):**  with our pasture assessment.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:23):**  So we've just bought one of those electronic plate wands where you go around, it's connected  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:27):**  to your Bluetooth and you put it over the grass and basically it gives you a height  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:31):**  and then you do enough measurements in the paddock and you get the data.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:34):**  So we're using that.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:35):**  And so what will happen is, and people will come and they'll go, oh, why are you using  
**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:38):**  that?  
**[0:28:39-0:28:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:39):**  And we'll talk about it and then they'll adapt it.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:41):**  And I reckon the same as with your other question.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:43):**  If you can get the language in the place where people will go, why are these indicators?  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:49):**  And the sheep sustainability framework has a lot of indicators coming, going to come  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:52):**  out in the next few months on all these things you talk about.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:28:57):**  You could report on it as an industry wide or you could also report as a farm basis on  
**[0:29:03-0:29:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:03):**  those indicators.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:04):**  Now you may say, I only want to chase the animal welfare premium.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:09):**  So all I'm choosing is that box.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:11):**  That's cool.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:12):**  I'm not worried.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:13):**  You might want to do the enviro ones.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:15):**  You're looking at protection.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:16):**  It might be about biodiversity.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:18):**  It might be about water quality.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:20):**  It might be depending where you are in the Australian landscape, it might be that irrigation.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:24):**  That's cool too.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:25):**  So I don't think there is one set that will suit everybody.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:29):**  But again, we're free market people here.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:32):**  You can select which ones you do or not at all.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:35):**  And then as long as you have that knowledge, you may use that knowledge and at least gives  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:38):**  you some, when a premium comes along, you can do like us and you go, okay, we're going  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:42):**  to go that way.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:43):**  I'm just saying the technology can fit in with some of those measurement things, which  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:48):**  makes it a bit easier, but also you need to own some of the decisions you're making of  
**[0:29:53-0:29:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:53):**  what you see is valuable for your farm.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:29:56):**  I think in Australia, if I was, I don't know, if I was in Queensland, I would have a whole  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:00):**  different set of matrices than what I do in Southern Victoria.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:04):**  That's one of the challenges is like a system that like came in from the top that said,  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:08):**  all farmers, thou shalt whatever.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:10):**  Like it's just not going to work because for all the reasons that you've said.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:14):**  The sheep sustainability framework is the opposite of that.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:17):**  It's totally saying here's a whole bunch of indicators we're going to judge ourselves  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:20):**  as an industry by.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:22):**  And obviously we need to have measurement tools to do them.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:25):**  And some of them, to be honest with you, we don't have very good measurement tools now.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:29):**  And like the beef sustainability framework, they don't have them now.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:32):**  And they're going, we still know that consumers are asking these questions about our product,  
**[0:30:38-0:30:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:38):**  but we don't know how we're going to measure it.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:39):**  But we're leaving it there as a desirable thing.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:42):**  And we try to work out how we're going to measure it.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:44):**  And I think that's been totally transparent with people.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:47):**  And I think that's a really useful thing.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:49):**  For Mark, a big key to industry wide change and to helping farmers balance the practical  
**[0:30:54-0:31:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:30:54):**  realities with some of these perhaps aspirational schemes will be technology.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:31:00):**  If you live in Victoria, in your sheep producer, you have to use EID now.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:31:05):**  So I was anti-EID when it first came in.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:31:07):**  I thought it was an impost on us we didn't need.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:31:10):**  And now I'm the biggest advocate you'll ever see.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:31:13):**  Partly because it is a really useful tool.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:31:17):**  I mean, I think the challenge for us is now we've got what every individual sheep identified  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:31:23):**  is to utilise that technology.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:31:26):**  And particularly for us, like for weight gain in our feed lodge, we used to have these passengers,  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:31:32):**  they'd be on a 21 or a 28 or a 35 day feed regime.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:31:36):**  And I reckon some of them went through two or three of those feeds around because they  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:31:41):**  kept on taking out, they didn't make market specs and they obviously weren't doing.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:31:45):**  Now we know who they are, they can go.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:31:49):**  If they're not going to do it after that, for whatever reason, they're gone.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:31:52):**  They go off the store, lay them off, they go.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:31:55):**  And that's the beauty of some of those technologies.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:31:58):**  And it's such a, you just have a reader there, it gives you weight gain.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:02):**  We have a couple of our young blokes here.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:04):**  They love it.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:05):**  They engage more in the workplace because they're using technology and they're so much  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:10):**  quicker at it than I.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:11):**  It's just they're wired to it.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:13):**  And so there's that sort of thing.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:15):**  I know this electronic plate meter, which we've just got, they're going to get excited  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:18):**  by that because instead of us driving off and all us guessing how much feed or quality  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:22):**  is in the paddock, we've actually got a tool which we'll use to calibrate their visual  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:27):**  reads all the time, which is great.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:29):**  It's just a Bluetooth to your phone.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:31):**  It's that simple.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:32):**  I mean, so some of that's pretty good.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:36):**  I mean, our stock records are still on Excel.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:39):**  I mean, we're a long way from where we should be on some of this, but it's still useful.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:47):**  When you look back, Mark, over since you've been farming, tell me about your best year  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:53):**  and your worst year or toughest decisions that you made.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:32:58):**  Oh, well, the worst is easy.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:33:00):**  And although positively the worst two years I had with the two drought years in the early  
**[0:33:06-0:33:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:33:06):**  2000s, I learned more in each of those years than I had in the 20 years around them, for  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:33:13):**  sure, or 25 years around them, because that was all about making decisions when you had  
**[0:33:19-0:33:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:33:19):**  the least resource.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:33:20):**  We dropped $1.8 million in the first year and $1.2 million in the second year.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:33:26):**  And we made a decision, which in hindsight, we kept too much stock too early.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:33:30):**  And so one of the challenges for us going forward is to have more flex in our system,  
**[0:33:36-0:33:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:33:36):**  which was one of the learnings from there.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:33:38):**  So we make decisions early.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:33:40):**  It's all about, we don't try to pick the top of the market or the bottom of the market.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:33:44):**  We try to make decisions.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:33:47):**  Last year we sold, in the autumn break hadn't come, we sold probably too many sheep than  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:33:53):**  we should have.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:33:54):**  But it just made us get through winter.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:33:56):**  We need to be able to sleep at night and we're still profitable, but it's about using the,  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:34:02):**  even though the three month weather forecast is not the most reliable tool, it's still  
**[0:34:06-0:34:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:34:06):**  on the basis, I always say, well, it's better than using nothing.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:34:09):**  So we need to use those and that those decision points in our one were those learnings from  
**[0:34:14-0:34:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:34:14):**  those drought years.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:34:15):**  And we've tried to keep where we have more flex in our system and that's reflected in  
**[0:34:20-0:34:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:34:20):**  our breeding objectives.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:34:21):**  I mean, we have a true dual purpose, you now that can go to a terminal or it can go back  
**[0:34:29-0:34:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:34:29):**  to a Merino.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:34:30):**  If Wool stays where it is at the moment, we will make the decision to join more terminals  
**[0:34:35-0:34:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:34:35):**  next year than we have this year.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:34:37):**  But because of the way we're at with that flexibility, we can do that.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:34:40):**  You just go buy some more terminal ramps.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:34:43):**  It's pretty straightforward, but then there are consequences obviously further on.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:34:47):**  The best years we've had, probably the best years are not necessarily the most favourite  
**[0:34:54-0:34:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:34:54):**  years.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:34:55):**  It's in the development and the design of wetlands and water systems and planning.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:00):**  I'm a geographer.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:01):**  I mean, that's my training.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:02):**  I love land.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:03):**  I love landscape.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:04):**  I love fencing to land type.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:07):**  I really enjoy how do you design a paddock so you utilise more of the food on offer at  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:14):**  all times.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:15):**  How do you design laneway systems, which mean that it's efficient to move stock around?  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:21):**  I mean, we have 50,000 DSCs and we have four and a half staff.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:26):**  You know, I mean, it's a very efficient operation and they paid well and they're really, their  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:31):**  staff are the most valuable thing we do is our staff.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:36):**  And that's one of the learnings we've got in that best year was how do we look at what  
**[0:35:41-0:35:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:41):**  was there?  
**[0:35:42-0:35:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:42):**  And a lot of it is about people.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:44):**  You know, it's not about the weather or the financial.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:48):**  It's about you want to get out of bed and you want to go to work because you want to  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:52):**  work with those people and they want to work with you and you feel active and they, you  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:35:56):**  know, they're not looking at their clock and they don't get to four or 30 or five and thinking  
**[0:36:01-0:36:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:36:01):**  where do they want to be?  
**[0:36:02-0:36:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:36:02):**  And that cultural stuff are my best years.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:36:05):**  And if I was going to do it ever again from the beginning, my advice to everyone is if  
**[0:36:11-0:36:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:36:11):**  you can't manage people, perhaps this isn't the industry for you.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:36:15):**  You need to be, it is a people industry.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:36:17):**  Mark, thank you so much.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:36:19):**  I literally could ask you a million more questions and someday I want to come visit the farm,  
**[0:36:24-0:36:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:36:24):**  but I think we'll leave it there for now.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/mark-wootton-on-carbon-neutral-farming#t=0:36:26):**  You'd be very welcome Sarah at any time and thank you very much.

**[0:00:05-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:05):**  I'm Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:07):**  Right now, there are a lot of existential threats facing global agriculture.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:11):**  Climate change, shifting consumer preferences, growing and aging populations, human health

**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:18):**  But there's also conviction that solutions exist, and that more are on the horizon, if  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:23):**  of course we invest in them sooner rather than later.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:27):**  And we know that to develop a biological product, it costs many millions of dollars, it needs  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:32):**  to be supported by science and takes probably five to seven years.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:37):**  So unless we get cracking now, I think we're going to have a distinct disadvantage on the  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:42):**  global marketplace by 2030.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:47):**  That's Ben Barlow.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:48):**  He's the managing director of New Edge Microbials.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:50):**  But Ben started out as, and continues to be, a farmer.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:54):**  In addition to growing crops, Ben and his family have been investing in businesses around  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:58):**  the farm gate for decades, owning companies and acquiring assets with the help of a group  
**[0:01:02-0:01:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:02):**  of collaborators.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:03):**  He's turned growing up in agriculture and a life in ag banking into a portfolio of investments  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:08):**  that are as much about the future of his farm as about the future of farming writ large.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:13):**  But let's start at the beginning.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:15):**  All of this work began when Ben first wanted to come back to the farm after college.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:19):**  When I finished uni, things were fairly tough in agriculture in Australia.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:22):**  There were really high interest rates and commodity prices were terrible.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:28):**  And that was in the early 90s.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:30):**  And my old man actually said, go and get a job.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:32):**  So I went and became a bank teller in Mildura.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:35):**  And from there, I had a really good career in banking, particularly agribusiness.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:39):**  And that led me to Sydney.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:42):**  And then after that, that led me to the United States for a while.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:46):**  And then after about 20 years in it, I decided that it would be time to go back to farming.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:51):**  But in that 20 years, my wife and I put together about 80,000 acres of hay.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:57):**  So we had an operating business up there that we'd been running from a distance for many  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:01):**  years.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:02):**  So we went from high in corporate life to living in the lead them at Burleyville.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:06):**  And that was great for a few years.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:07):**  And then we sold that to a corporate investor and then made various agricultural investments  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:13):**  after that, which was about six years ago.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:16):**  When you were working in the banking world, especially in agribusiness banking, I always  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:21):**  think that bankers have such a unique view on agriculture, talking to a lot of different  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:25):**  owners and operators and different financing models and different operating models, different  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:29):**  decisions.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:30):**  They're in some pretty deep and personal business conversations.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:34):**  What were some of your insights or lessons from that time in banking?  
**[0:02:38-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:38):**  Well, it was a great career because it traversed credit and marketing and developing the agribusiness  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:46):**  platform that we built in the United States.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:49):**  And you learn a lot about what makes a business work well.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:53):**  I think because you see such a wide variety across your desk over a long time, you start  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:59):**  thinking about where the good opportunities are and why people are successful.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:03:05):**  And predominantly there's opportunity everywhere.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:03:08):**  I think it's actually the culture and the people that come in behind a venture that  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:03:15):**  create the real value and momentum.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:03:17):**  I often say we do a lot of things that a corporate would do in a family company.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:03:22):**  We do this profiles, for example, in all our staff and 360 feedback as you would in a corporate

**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:03:40):**  But really it's the understanding of the leadership team and operation of one another that it  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:03:47):**  creates the momentum and the value.

**[0:04:20-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:04:20):**  operated.

**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:04:27):**  Everyone we've hired at sort of a company principles, if you like, are fairly grounded  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:04:32):**  and earthy and the way we operate is long-term and strategic.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:04:36):**  We're not driven by the investment cycle today.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:04:41):**  We might be one day, but we'd be ready for that.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:04:44):**  It's more in sort of the serious fun, I call it, in the business where there's a culture  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:04:49):**  of being open and having fun with one another and then achieving some pretty amazing things,  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:04:55):**  which requires a lot of time, a lot of long hours and focus.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:04:59):**  That's what attracts people.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:05:00):**  I was only thinking about this the other day.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:05:01):**  I was looking at the staff, particularly at NEM and the structure here.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:05:05):**  We're an Ag company.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:05:06):**  We're 50% male, 50% female.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:05:08):**  The leadership team's 50-50 and the average age is probably under 40.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:05:13):**  That's across the whole operation.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:05:15):**  It's about creating opportunity.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:05:16):**  Ag is a bit sexy now, I must say.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:05:19):**  It attracts good talent and I think COVID's helped too, Sarah, by some very good people  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:05:24):**  that have gone to the city for a career have wanted to come back to a good, strong region

**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:08:04):**  about where we sit in the global marketplace and what we could potentially do with it.

**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:09:26):**  depending on where you read it.

**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:17:57):**  have a brand and a reputation that they're prepared to accept your product.

**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:18:09):**  and validated by third parties in order to have acceptance.

**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:18:28):**  And yet in reality, forming a partnership that's mutually beneficial is pretty challenging  
**[0:18:33-0:18:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:18:33):**  in my experience.

**[0:18:45-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:18:45):**  and seeing a few principles align before you start.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:18:48):**  Our scientific partnerships, for example, have been formed by acquiring what is what

**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:19:13):**  I'll give you the idea of partnership in science is to actually to acquire that intellectual  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:19:20):**  property, retain the scientists that have developed it in a commercial project to get

**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:19:35):**  So that's why I call it a great partnership.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:19:36):**  It transcends time and it's in for the long run.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:19:41):**  It's good for the company because we've acquired the IP.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:19:44):**  It's great for the researchers because they have a secure source of funding and it's an

**[0:19:58-0:20:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:19:58):**  So if you think of this business, it's a really complicated business, but it's a really  
**[0:20:05-0:20:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:20:05):**  simple model.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:20:05):**  It's more products that we develop going to the hands of our existing farmers or new  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:20:11):**  farmers that we're doing business with around the world, which creates more revenue and  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:20:17):**  more profit for them, which allows us to spend more on research, which allows us to spend,

**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:20:28):**  It's really simple as easy to understand, but quite complex underneath.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:20:34):**  But that's what we do.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:20:36):**  I can see us in the next decade being one of the largest private research funders in  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:20:43):**  the country, all out of retained earnings.

**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:20:51):**  years, you said sort of 18 to 50 people and expanding presence, building some of those  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:20:56):**  systems, any growing pains or examples of the mistakes that you made along that journey?

**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:21:11):**  I think the other mistake we made too, is we were growing very fast and we didn't have  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:21:15):**  the human capital behind us, you know, working pretty long hours and didn't have a lot of  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:21:19):**  time to reflect on the business and the strategy and where we want to go.

**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:21:26):**  We've always grown to annual plans.

**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:21:32):**  company will go and what we think we'll have available to use to invest in parts of the

**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:21:42):**  When we're thinking about applying capital, we look at applying it where we get the best

**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:21:52):**  We're governed by a board, which we've appointed to keep us on the straight and narrow.

**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:29:28):**  that can be made by the adoption of some technologies or an algorithm of three or four  
**[0:29:34-0:29:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:29:34):**  and really do some good work on that.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:29:36):**  I think there's a lot of learning to be done there.

**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:29:44):**  to think about you think, yeah, what's out there and how do you pull it all together?  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:29:50):**  I see what's happened in the last 30 years in farming where we've gone from long fellow  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:29:55):**  and small equipment to rotational cropping and big gear and efficiency and now all of  
**[0:30:01-0:30:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:30:01):**  the stuff to do with controlled traffic and linking your spray rigs to your harvesters  
**[0:30:08-0:30:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:30:08):**  to you.

**[0:30:16-0:30:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:30:16):**  satellite measurements of soil and I look at all that and I think, gee, the next decade  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:30:23):**  is going to be really exciting.

**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:30:30):**  been for the last decade in terms of farming wood costs.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:30:33):**  I just see that as a real challenge coming up because of all these global pressures.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:30:38):**  So all this technology theoretically should help us maintain our competitiveness.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:30:42):**  So bring it on, I say as quickly as possible.

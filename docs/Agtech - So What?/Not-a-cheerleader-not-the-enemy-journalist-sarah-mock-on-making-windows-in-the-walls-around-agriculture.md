### Agtech - So What?  (2020-01-07)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast, brought to you by Agthentic. I'm  Sarah Nolet. On this episode, we meet a woman who is not afraid to shine a light on some  controversial topics in agriculture, even when she offends people along the way. Sarah  Mock has spent her entire career involved in ag, from working in high profile ag tech  startups to more recently reporting on ag policy and rural issues in DC.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:00:29):**  We talk in ag a lot about why people don't understand enough about farming or why we  have to tell the story of American agriculture so much. And like, it just doesn't seem like  it's occurred to enough people, maybe that maybe it's because like we're not telling  the authentic story. And it's not because consumers are stupid that they don't understand.  It's because they know a fake story when they hear one.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:00:53):**  Just recently, Sarah set off a Twitter firestorm after writing an article asserting that all  farming is exploitative to its workers, the land, plants and animals, and even farmers  and their families. Her outspoken critiques of the industry have led some to believe that  she is anti-farming or even hates ag. But this couldn't be further from the truth.  Sarah makes the point that business 101 for any other industry is that the customer is  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:01:20):**  always right. She's concerned that farmers are missing out on new opportunities in ag  tech innovation and sustainability because the ag industry is fixated on defending its  current practices rather than listening to consumers or engaging in frank and open conversations,  especially with people whose perspectives don't come from inside agriculture. Sarah's  passion for ag began growing up on her family's farm.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:01:46):**  So I grew up on a farm in Wyoming. What I did not know at the time was is what most  people would call a hobby farm. Less than five acres, we grew a big market garden and  raised market poultry and I had a dairy goat herd and we raised lambs. I mean, I lived  in Wyoming, so there were like huge cattle ranches, like 20,000 acre cattle ranches.  But like in terms of any kind of small scale production, like we were as big as anyone  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:02:09):**  or as small as anyone. So I thought I grew up on a farm. I definitely had that impression  of my own childhood, but it wasn't until I got involved in the agricultural industry  after college that I realized that other people might not think of it that way. But yeah,  where I grew up, you know, I spent my school years waking up at like five 30 in the morning  to milk goats before school and like deliver the milk to my neighbors who bought it like  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:02:35):**  in Mason jars for a dollar from me. And you know, I built, I had to do like the, the business  side, I had to do record keeping. I had to do all of the small businessy farm stuff that  4-H and FFA kids are supposed to do, which was really exciting.  For listeners who might not know, the FFA or Future Farmers of America is a hundred  year old ag education program for youth in America that currently has six million active  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:03:02):**  participants. So what Sarah is basically saying is that she had the full American farm kid  experience, even if the farm she grew up on was small and not really her family's main  source of income.  That was the thing I was doing as a kid. My parents both worked off farm. It was 100%  a hobby for them. It was probably a giant cash hole I would imagine. And it certainly  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:03:23):**  like costs my family a lot. So I, that was apparent to me, but, but it was fun and we  liked it and I thought that's what farming was. So I didn't have any concept of that  not being the right way. So then I, I, I definitely left Wyoming and left high school thinking,  you know, farming is interesting and it's cool and I did it growing up, but it's kind  of pastoral and it's backwards and it doesn't make sense to me. So I was going to go off  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:03:47):**  to college and do something more important. And it was, you know, midway through college  when I was at Georgetown and studying international affairs and all my classmates were obsessed  with kind of the Arab spring and things that were happening in global geopolitics. And  I was that annoying girl that raised their hand in every class to say, you know, there  would be no Syrian civil war if there hadn't been an agricultural collapse in Syria in  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:04:09):**  2008. And there would be no Arab spring if bread prices hadn't spiked in Egypt and throughout  the region. So, you know, if we could just figure out agricultural development, we actually  wouldn't need all this expertise in, in global geopolitics. And I quickly found some professors  who were sympathetic to my plight, but were like, yeah, Georgetown's not actually the  right school for you to be at, to be learning that stuff. So I was kind of encouraged to  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:04:36):**  go abroad, where I actually went abroad for a year and went to, I spent six months in  South Africa, six months in India, six weeks at the end of that in Burkina Faso in West  Africa. And I'll actually a little bit of time at the beginning in Haiti doing a different  project, but got to do, got to study food science and urban agriculture in South Africa  and do organic agricultural extension work in India, and really got exposure to kind  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:05:01):**  of the global ag picture and thought I wanted to do agricultural development or work kind  of in the international agriculture space. And basically just slowly was disillusioned  throughout that year abroad from the idea that a white girl from Wyoming could do any  of that work meaningfully.  What do you mean by that?  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:05:20):**  So basically, I think the most important lesson I learned trying to work in agricultural development.  So in Haiti, I did a solar kind of social impact project that was like an exclusive  failure. It just like did not work at all. We partnered with an NGO that was ineffective  and didn't have a good relationship with the community. We focused with a business that  never delivered the technology. We had a partnership with a community that actually like did not  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:05:46):**  want to really be in partnership with us. And we were, we were college kids, and we  didn't really have the capacity to make this a long term sustainable project. So I basically  like, you know, got disillusioned from the idea that social impact in a in a development  setting was impactful. Then I went to South Africa and worked with academic institution  while they built an urban garden in or an urban farm in a local township and, you know,  
**[0:06:12-0:06:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:06:12):**  saw the students getting PhDs in this program had never, some of them had like only ever  visited the township like two or three times in a five year period where they were earning  their PhD as like studying this community and kind of got disabused of the idea that  academics or you know, study is a meaningful way to engage with the community and actually  learn what it needs and develop in that way. When I was in India, I actually worked with  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:06:41):**  an NGO and a governmental organization to provide research and backing to encourage  some use of local species and more indigenous plants and animals as part of local agricultural  practices. But basically found that like, the local NGO that I was working with, like,  was really invested in a really specific outcome and didn't actually want to know what was  best for the farmers. They just wanted to get some research to justify their position.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:07:08):**  So I was like, oh, God, government and nonprofits are not doing good work either.  The final point of disillusionment with ag development work was when Sarah worked with  a community of entrepreneurs in Burkina Faso, who had invented products that were recognized  by the World Bank. But unfortunately, even winning a major international prize wasn't  enough to ensure simple things like IP protection. They returned to their country hoping to,  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:07:34):**  you know, expecting that the World Bank was going to follow up and provide them this intellectual  property protection that they had promised. And then the World Bank did not do that. So  basically, you know, I worked with an entrepreneur who had invented a piece of technology to  transport small amounts of agricultural, it was basically like a three wheeled motorcycle  that had like a wagon attached to the back that was like very specifically kind of regionally  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:07:59):**  relevant for people and you can buy his his technology, his innovation in Burkina Faso,  it's made by a Chinese company now, it which is just like, I was just like, Oh, God, like,  this is like the perfect example of how we just like hang everyone out to dry, like all  the development work we're doing is not actually working. It's just like, performative, basically,  it's just like being in the world and pretending like we're doing all these great things and  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:08:25):**  putting on events and giving nice speeches and then just like throwing people to the  wolves and stealing their ideas and ransacking their communities and just like basically  I came back from my year abroad and I was like, Oh, God, if there's anything that I  can do to help, you know, global farmers and to meaningfully contribute to international  agricultural development, it's fixed some of the problems of American agriculture, because  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:08:46):**  we export them every day wholesale without asking whether anyone wants them or not. And  they're like the exact problems that we have in America and that are quite advanced in  America get exported, you know, all around the world. And, and like, frankly, kind of  like forced upon people whether they want them or not, because the narrative is that  American agriculture is like the peak of agriculture in the world and that anyone would be happy  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:09:09):**  to produce in the way that we do, regardless of whether that would actually be a good solution  for them.  When you came back, did you have an idea of like which challenges in the states you'd  tackle or how you tackle them? Or did that kind of come about through more learning or  more time in at Georgetown?  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:09:29):**  Yeah, I actually so I came back and was like, okay, of all the people that I met abroad  who was doing the best work. And the conclusion I reached was like, it was entrepreneurs,  people who actually live and work and like live and breathe their community and are on  the ground and see the problems and aren't trying to give away a solution for free, aren't  trying to, you know, raise grant money to do these things. It's people who are in business  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:09:54):**  in partnership with their communities and trying to solve these problems on the ground  and have kind of a financial incentive to do that. So I basically came back to Georgetown  and I was like, Well, I guess it's Silicon Valley for me. Because that's where the entrepreneurs  live in America. So I literally just started, you know, I remember the day I was sitting  around the table with my apartment mates while they were all putting in applications to work  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:10:17):**  for, you know, the major consulting firms and the major finance firms. I was just like,  I was sitting there with them and I wanted to do something too, but they but I but I  wasn't I didn't want to apply to any of those things. So I basically just like went on LinkedIn  and started cold emailing people and just like finding CEOs of of ag tech startups that  I thought were interesting and just like, just like sending them cold email LinkedIn  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:10:41):**  requests and just being like, Hi, I think you're really interesting. Like, would you  like to grab coffee? Or would you like to chat for 15 minutes on the phone? And in that  year, probably like eight, eight or nine month period, I probably talked to 60 to 80 startup  CEOs from kind of all across the space, you know, everything from the folks at robot to,  you know, people who are working in seed technology to people who are working in the software  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:11:08):**  space and data science, all the way to kind of the food side. So yeah, it was it was a  big endeavor. I cast like the widest possible net and was basically just like, well, someone  I talked to is eventually going to think I'm interesting, right? And maybe hire me.  In having those 60 or 80 conversations, did you a still believe in entrepreneurs in the  private sector as as the place to be and be kind of any insights about like, where? Yeah,  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:11:35):**  how did you end up where you ended up after that?  Yes, I think I actually really loved those conversations I had with those startup CEOs  and found them really life giving and empowering. What I found disappointing was how many of  those CEOs were, you know, had these great technologies had these interesting ideas had  these perspectives that matched mine about where the industry needed to go, but they  
**[0:11:59-0:12:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:11:59):**  weren't finding success. They weren't reaching farmers. And that kind of was the genesis  of, of a lot of questions for me, because I was like, wow, this is globally advanced  technology that these people are working on this, you know, whether it's the data software  or the machinery, or, you know, the genetics, like all of these tools are so advanced, and  the things that these technologies could promise for a farmer could promise for a small business  
**[0:12:28-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:12:28):**  owner are truly revolutionary. And, and no one can figure out how to convince farmers  that that's true. Like what what is happening there? That like what what is being lost in  this conversation? I think we chalk it up to a lot to to like Silicon Valley people  just don't get rural America or just don't get farmers or American agriculture is a handshake  business. And so it doesn't matter how good your technology is, if you don't have that  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:12:54):**  personal relationship, it's not going to be successful. But to me, as someone who understood  farmers, American farmers in particular as like these advanced, like business people,  that didn't quite make sense, because it seems it doesn't matter how highly you value relationships  if like someone's offering you 10 x return, how could you be ignoring that? Yeah.  So then you went to work actually in the tech space for a bit. Did you find answers to those  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:13:22):**  questions? The first company I worked for was called on farm, it is no longer a company  got to learn the number one rule of startups, which is that most of them fail. So I got  laid off 11 months after I started there. And then I actually went to work for a company  that actually had a kind of similar technology, but was just doing it, frankly, like much,  much better. Farmers Business Network, who all they both had a kind of agricultural management  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:13:47):**  technologies, software management, and and that relied really heavily on data and data  analysis. And yeah, I especially when I arrived at FBN, I think a lot of those questions were  really at the top of people's minds. I think that they the organization was really driven  by those questions. I mean, that's that was my what the whole point of my job was basically  to answer that question. How do you explain data to farmers? How do you make farmers not  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:14:10):**  only understand what the data says, but understand that it's valuable, understand that it is  a benefit to their bottom line that it is a part of kind of their business equation  to understand how successful a seed is over, you know, not just over the 40 acres or 200  acres or 800 acres that they planted it on, but having access to how that seed worked  on 100,000 acres across the country with on soils like yours or in conditions like yours,  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:14:39):**  you know, that was really valuable information that FBN had even back when when I was working  there seed finder was which was their original data tool was all that they had and it like  I was like, Oh my gosh, like this is it seems so subtle and kind of obvious but it was actually  like really revolutionary information. Totally. I'm curious if you I mean, this is like the  the silver bullet question of ag tech you obviously didn't stay at FBN forever and went  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:15:05):**  on to other pursuits and like did that have to do with did not answering that question  or not finding a satisfying answer that question? Yeah, I think and I don't mean this as any  knock on FBN. I think that they in a very rational business way, realize that there  were easier things to convince farmers of lower cost points that they could that they  could access to, you know, at the end of the day, like FBN has investors that they have  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:15:32):**  to respond to and they have to create returns and they're always going to be under that  pressure right as far as as long as they're a they're a venture backed company and maybe  a different I was part of the marketing team, maybe a different marketing team, a different  communications team could have found the silver bullet like you said, I don't really think  that we did and I think that FBN you know, today FBN has FBN direct and does kind of  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:15:56):**  a big procurement business and provides kind of access to a whole range of kind of marketplace  items and that's, that's very different from that original product, right? I'm just trying  to share networked data with farmers that provided them information that was valuable  to their business that would help them make decisions. I think, you know, when I first  started an agtech decision agriculture as like a take on precision agriculture was like  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:16:19):**  a buzzword that people were excited about because it was like, Oh my gosh, we've we've  solved it. We figured out how to make data matter to farmers. You do it by turning it  into decisions. But we, we tried that. None of that worked. None of that was interesting  to the farmers in a meaningful way. It was like, yes, I understand what's happening in  the data. It's not that I'm confused. Like I'm interested and that's all like I'm going  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:16:42):**  to trust I'm going to trust my experience on my field more. I'm going to trust my seed  dealer more. I'm going to like the the information is interesting but but it's not enough to  make me change my mind about anything. And it's like, okay, to me, that was a fundamental  just like misalignment of like, okay, if 100,000 acres worth of anonymized data on your seed  that tells you that's the wrong seed for that soil isn't enough to convince you to not waste  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:17:09):**  the money, then like, I don't know what is it that seems to be the end of the road for  that discussion.  It also ended up being the end of the road for Sarah and agtech, at least for now. She  felt like she was putting too much time and energy into something that just wasn't working.  So she returned to Washington DC to report on the Trump administration for rural America.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:17:30):**  And this gave her a chance to understand the American ag system and its incentives, including  farm policies and legislation from a whole new angle.  The reason why farmers don't respond directly to economic incentives is because there's  other kinds of economic incentives like farm subsidies or, you know, risk management through  the federal government. So I was like, okay, maybe I can go and learn how the farm bill  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:17:52):**  works and learn how these these choices get made by covering the 2018 farm bill and dig  into that process. And maybe then I'll understand what the incentives are and what's really  behind these decisions for farmers. And then maybe I'll have more insight on how to have  conversations about how to really move the system forward. That isn't just like talking  to a wall, which is what I felt like I was doing a lot of the times trying to convince  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:18:15):**  farmers that that data matters.  And how did that go? Did that hypothesis prove itself out?  Um, no. So the 2018 farm bill was a fascinating thing to watch. I went to Washington to cover  a farm bill and ended up spending three years covering trade aid packages. The farm bill  was basically irrelevant in the broader conversation. I almost, you know, if I was, if I talked  
**[0:18:43-0:18:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:18:43):**  to a farmer and could only ask them three questions, farm bill was going to be the third  thing I asked about.  The farm bill, which happens every five years in the US, sets out the food and farm programs,  including food security, risk management programs and funding for innovation. It's usually number  one on the agenda for farmers when it's being debated. But at the time, free trade agreements  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:19:03):**  were on the line and very much in focus.  We almost scrapped NAFTA in a day, which was insanity. And then we did enter into a trade  war with China. And I'm sure most people listening maybe know this, but you know, 60% of US soybeans  are destined, are planted essentially for China. You know, one in every third row in  the United States. China is the market that everyone has been talking about for 15, 20  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:19:31):**  years at least. And the idea that that was, let alone, I mean, and China is still even  now kind of other than in soybeans, maybe it's still kind of a future market. You know,  Mexico and Canada are our number one trading partners in most agricultural products right  now. So the fact that all of that was up, you know, potentially being out the window  at the same time was I think, a very scary time for markets. When US pork producers are  
**[0:19:56-0:20:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:19:56):**  talking about how if NAFTA goes away, pork producers will lose $56 a pig. The idea that  like a risk mitigation program in the farm bill that's going to, you know, net a few  dollars a pig is just like, it's just not relevant to the conversation that is ongoing.  It actually kind of goes to your tagline or kind of description on Twitter would like  making windows in the walls around farming, we're all food and ag with a rusty spoon,  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:20:22):**  not a cheerleader, not the enemy. Tell me about that phrase and does it like how it  kind of came to be? Sure. I'll start with the second part. So not a cheerleader, not  the enemy. I think I've never worked for an ag media organization that did not at some  point refer to themselves as a cheerleader for the industry. Like, you know, we're like,  we believe in American agriculture, we like this is the right thing. Like we're cheerleaders,  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:20:44):**  we try to avoid overtly negative stories, and we try to have positive stories as much  as we can. And, again, I've, in all of the reporting and all of the different places  I've worked in ag, I don't think that that is an uncommon sentiment anywhere. And I don't  think there's an understanding of how strange that is for media organizations to think.  Tell me more about that. So media is not about promotion. Journalism in the public interest  
**[0:21:21-0:21:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:21:21):**  is not about promoting the efforts of like an economically viable group organization  or group of organizations. It's just like not what it's for. It's to inform the public,  it's to inform the people involved. I think in ag, and maybe more than other places, like,  you know, I think there's been a bit of confusion about our farmers, you know, consumers or  our farmers businesses. And I think obviously, you could very easily say both. But I think  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:21:47):**  that, I don't know, we've, we've created a very complex situation in our media environment  where I think it's really hard to come by ag media that that doesn't think of itself  as very, as part of an ecosystem that needs to like self perpetuate. And by self perpetuating,  it entrenches like a specific group of people and businesses and doesn't think it is a negative  that it is negative that they are by doing that, you know, excluding whole, enormous  
**[0:22:17-0:22:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:22:17):**  other groups or possibilities or options. So that's not a cheerleader perspective. I  mean, I guess the phrase that came to mind was like speaking truth to power, even just  questioning things like a lot of ag media and a lot of ag conversations end up in a  black and white, right and wrong in or out kind of framing, which has definitely been  my experience. And I've been like, drowning in the gray area in between trying to make  
**[0:22:41-0:22:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:22:41):**  sense of it all. I don't know if that resonates for you with the phrase like speaking truth  to power sort of seems absent in a nuanced, effective way. It's just like black or white  conversations all over the place.  Totally. Well, and it's not even just it's not even just truth to power. It's just truth,  period. I've made this comment on Twitter recently, agriculture is in the US is very  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:23:03):**  attached to the idea that we have to tell our story in a very specific way so that people  understand that's called spinning a story. You should be able to just tell the truth.  And that's the truth. And that's the end like that you don't have to show a face like authenticity  is important. When you tell the truth. People say like, why are you being so negative? Why  are you like, what, why would you say it like that? Because you know, that disadvantages  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:23:36):**  us to say it like that. And it's like, I don't know how to tell you that like the truth doesn't  ever disadvantage.  The pushback would be that like, especially when it comes to food, there are things that  consumers don't want to know, whether it's like death of animals, or you know, culling  invasive species or spraying chemical, like whatever it is, there's stuff that consumers  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:24:01):**  don't want to know. And so the argument is like, don't show that stuff, even if it's  true, because it it makes us look bad. But what's your response to that argument?  So this is like a fundamental misalignment of our priorities in agriculture, right? Why  don't your customers want to know about the like the your your like treatment of animals  or the way that we you know, treat chemically treat plants or animals, any of those things  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:24:26):**  like sure, there's probably a way to spin them to pretend like it's not happening. But  like if consumers have a problem with them, why don't you address the problem? Why don't  you give consumers what they want, you sell a product, and you can just give it to people,  you don't have to fight them and convince them that what you already have is what they  want. I was talking to a farmer recently, actually, about this exact thing, where he,  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:24:54):**  you know, has been on an has been on a couple of active trade missions to Europe recently.  And what American trade missions to Europe look like is basically just US trade officials  trying to badger Europeans into giving up resistance to GMOs. But his like, from his  perspective as a young farmer, who's who's interested in who wants to be organic, and  who wants to explore these other things, and who wants to get not the commodity price for  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:25:21):**  his crops. He's like, I don't know, like, I have a business background. And like, where  I come from, we don't tell consumers what they want. We give them what they want. Like,  we don't convince them to buy what we have, we make what they want. And it's just like,  sure. You can you can market and you can change the you can try and like shape the story so  that you can do the easiest thing or the cheapest thing and and just hope your consumers never  
**[0:25:49-0:25:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:25:49):**  realize how you're cutting corners. Or you can just give them what they want. Businesses  sell things to people and sell them what they want. They don't try to hoodwink them into  buying what they have, so that they don't have to do better. And I think that we don't  in agriculture, there's an aversion to that flip of the power dynamic, I think as producers,  and and paradoxically, I think this comes from the fact that producers often feel very  
**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:26:19):**  disadvantaged in the market.  Your point that you've made recently, and even goes to the point of like, don't ask  the question like you didn't grow up on a farm or you didn't grow up on a real farm  or big enough farm or whatever, which is pushback I get as well as someone who had a hobby farm,  but but not a quote unquote, real farm, whatever that means. But your point is that like, we  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:26:36):**  pay taxes. And so we get to say, also, like, you can learn things about industry and still  have an opinion.  Yeah, the you don't know agriculture, so you don't get to get to have an opinion is like  obvious gatekeeping. And that's just we I don't know, it's 2020. Like, check the internet,  that that's a frowned upon activity. Like, I guess you can try it, but I think we've  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:26:57):**  we've moved past it. So just like, you don't get to pick who gets to talk. Everyone gets  to talk like, sorry, especially again, yeah, to your point, especially if taxpayers just  paid $60 billion over the last three years, you know, if this was an investment situation,  I would now we would all now be shareholders, we would now all on equity in your business,  we would get a representative board seat, one would assume we would have a direct say.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:27:21):**  So at the very least, you cannot shut people down on Twitter, you should be taking much  more direct feedback from them, given that they are, you know, underwriting your business  at the moment. But um, to the other half of that question. Okay, I guess I would say,  if it's really the best way to do it right now. And you've tried to explain it, and it's  not getting through to people or people still doubt you, then change it. Like, I don't know,  
**[0:27:49-0:27:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:27:49):**  I don't know what to tell you, if if Apple said, like, child, child factory labor is  the best way for us to do it right now. I don't know if that's a good example. But like,  like, I don't know, like, it's just like, not a good excuse that like, your customer  doesn't want to done that way. You also in your bottom three profile, you know, not the  enemy. So you obviously are incredibly passionate about agriculture and the future of agriculture.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:28:14):**  And I guess tell me about the is there anything there beyond not the enemy of passionate about  the industry and curious about the making windows part as well?  Yes, so the not the enemy part is very much, you know, I don't know why I keep coming back  to ag, it's really an exclusive space. It wants to shut out people who don't agree.  It doesn't really create a lot of opportunities for for alternative modes of thinking, let  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:28:44):**  alone alternative modes of thinking like from people who are not middle aged white men,  I left the farm as a kid thinking I was never going to come back to agriculture for a reason.  And very at various points along my career, I've thought like this industry isn't safe  for me, this industry isn't, you know, isn't right for me, I could do so I could be so  much more successful, I could do so many other things, I could make more money, I could be  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:29:06):**  happier, I could work less, I could do other things if I just left ag, and I haven't been  able to do it. Like, this is my home. I grew up here, these people raised me, I grew up,  you know, some of my most important moments in middle school and high school were doing  FFA and 4-H. You know, I think one of the most important lessons talking about, you  know, lessons I learned abroad was that you can be the most impactful place you will ever  
**[0:29:33-0:29:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:29:33):**  work is in the community that raised you. Because you understand the politics and the  incentives and the motivations inherently because you grew up in them. And you can't,  they can't ever like fully kick you out. But I've kind of also I think, fallen in love  with it. They don't think you can really know a thing and learn a thing, you know, become  an expert in a space without loving it. But I think you can't become an expert in a space  
**[0:30:07-0:30:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:30:07):**  or really know a space without also seeing all the horrible things that are happening  there too, right? You have to know the truth. That's how you love something. And I think  that's, that's the the line, not the not a cheerleader, not the enemy is all about that  for me. Like the reason I want to have these conversations, the reasons I talk about this  in public in my writing on Twitter, wherever is not because I hate ag or farmers, or you  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:30:33):**  know, corn or whatever I'm talking about on a given day. It's because I love it. And so  I just think that there's so much more freedom and so much more mobility and so much more  opportunity and potential for prosperity. If we just are more open about the realities,  we talk in ag a lot about why people don't understand enough about farming or why people  don't, you know, why we have to talk tell the story of American agriculture so much  
**[0:31:02-0:31:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:31:02):**  and like, it just doesn't seem like it's occurred to enough people maybe that maybe it's because  like we're not telling the authentic story. And it's not because consumers are stupid  that they don't understand. It's because they know a fake story when they hear one, and  they don't buy it. And they are looking for something like grittier and more real something  that feels intuitively right. One of my favorite tweets of yours recently  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:31:30):**  was if you think that cropping decisions are primarily driven by what's best for the land  and not almost exclusively influenced by existing infrastructure, equipment, skills, preferences,  then we have fundamentally different understandings of incentives, which I love because it's it  gets at exactly your point of that gritty, like, this is why we're making the decisions  and it's not necessarily perfect, but we've invested in this combine or we've invested  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:31:53):**  in this shed or we've invested in whatever or we like doing it this way. And this is  why I'm doing it and I'm open to the conversation or open to the research technology innovation  potential to change it. But it's not this like, we're doing it because it's best now  leave me alone. Yes, argument that gets thrown out there. That's that's pretty transparent.  Totally. Well, see, and that's, this is like the whole thing. And to, to your other question  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:32:17):**  from long ago, um, but I promise I will answer the making holes in the walls around agriculture.  That's the thing. People just, people don't want to tell you what to do. They don't want  to tell you how to farm. They don't know. They know that they don't know. They just  want to talk to you about it. They want to have a real conversation. They want you to  know that they don't like that you're spraying chemicals on your crops. They want to hear  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:32:38):**  that you're thinking about how you're going to stop doing that. I think we have such a  focus in American agriculture. And I mean, it's obvious and just the way that people  introduce themselves, I'm, I'm Joe farmer and I'm a fifth generation farmer. Like the  fact that your title is basically your legacy is just like, right. We, we put, we're telling  you that you're most valuable because of, of your, of things that have happened in the  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:33:02):**  past. But why, why is that true? I, you know, when I talk to farmers, I want to hear about  what you're, what you're going to do. I want to hear about your contribution. I don't want  to know about what people did four generations ago. What they did back then is not relevant  anymore to what's happening now. But it's ironic too, cause in any other industry, can  you imagine being like, I'm a fourth generation investment banker. People would be like, cool.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:33:26):**  I never want to talk to you again. Right. It just, yeah, it is pretty ironic and far  and I get it. Like we've take, if, if the sentiment is my family has taken care of this  land for that long and look how sustainable our operation is and here's what our plan  is for the future. Totally open to that conversation. How has it changed? What practices have changed?  Love it. But the, yeah, the kind of credibility that comes from that just on face value doesn't,  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:33:51):**  doesn't stack up for me either. Yeah, absolutely. Well, and that's, and I  think that comes down to, you know, if you want to kind of sum up all the conversations  I've had on Twitter recently, I feel like the, the fact of them in a weird kind of meta  analysis way, the fact of them is the perfect illustration of the problem. Like the problem  is that no one's allowed to talk that like if someone points out something true or not  
**[0:34:18-0:34:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:34:18):**  debatable or not, the answer is we have to mobilize to shut them down. It's not like  let's have a constructive conversation with them. It wasn't even, let's see if we can  contact this person offline and, and like see if there's like an opportunity for a more  intimate conversation to gain feedback or, or, you know, understand how this person is  where their concept of the world is coming from.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:34:41):**  How does all of that make you feel like you say it with a bit of a laugh in your voice?  And I know I imagine some of it's pretty amusing, but I can't imagine it always feels good.  Yeah. It definitely, I have a really great community of people around me who support  me and you know, who have similar ideas about agriculture and I'm really lucky to have found  them because I would not be here anymore without them. People like Sarah Tabor, people like  
**[0:35:14-0:35:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:35:14):**  Chris Newman are online, offline, in real life on social media there to support me publicly,  support me privately, and more importantly have just like shaped my thinking in a really  powerful way and a really constructive way. Right. And like all of these recommendations  that I could make to farmers about like, you know, where you could have, where this conversation  could have gone, where I, you know, we could have reached common ground and you could have  
**[0:35:41-0:35:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:35:41):**  illustrated the power of your idea by persuasion and not through like an act of force. Like  I know that that's possible because people have done that to me before. Right. Like all  the experiences and ideas that I have or all the ideas that I have in agriculture have  come to me from farmers and ex farmers. These aren't things that I'm like making up or like,  like these are thoughts that I've heard from people in the industry. And I think one of  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:36:08):**  the things I mentioned recently before I left Twitter was, you know, for every farmer who  is in my sub tweets telling me I was wrong, there were five in my DMS telling me I had  it exactly right. So that was, that was like fine to me because, you know, I think there  was a lot of other things happening on Twitter too. I think, you know, masculinity and misogyny  in agriculture is really problematic in a lot of ways. And I think for better or worse,  
**[0:36:31-0:36:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:36:31):**  like that's been a reality of my career so far and I've found various ways to deal with  that mentally and emotionally. So it affects me less.  Are there any examples of that that you're willing to share?  You know, it's like the little moments like being at ag conferences where you're standing,  talking to a farmer you've talked to, I've talked to, I am standing with a farmer talking,  
**[0:36:57-0:37:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:36:57):**  talking with them, you know, a farmer that I've talked to a hundred times, you know,  I've had phone conversations with, have had a long professional relationship with, and  then they like suddenly things become very intimate and it's like, oh God, I don't know  how to extricate myself from this. And like, you know, and then like you receive comments  from other farmers and it becomes this whole thing where it's like, oh, I'm just an object  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:37:18):**  in this, in this world. Like, am I even a person here?  As you can hear, Sarah is not afraid to call out injustices. Recently, she wrote a piece  asking the question, is it possible to farm without exploitation? Her conclusion was no,  that modern farming exploits the land because it takes something from the environment and  the people, workers, but also farmers and their families without sufficient compensation.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:37:44):**  I guess I will say at the top exploitation, you know, the technical definition is just  like to use something to its fullest extent. I don't think that that's, you know, the connotation  of exploitation is that, you know, overuse, abusive use, someone being forced to make  a sacrifice that they feel like they don't have a choice not to make. And I think we,  especially in the regenerative ag space, which is a space I'm really interested in and have  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:38:09):**  enjoyed working in and have found a lot of kind of kindred spirits in, even there, I  think there's a really exploitative vein that we haven't, that people aren't super comfortable  talking about. I think, for example, I think one of the most important things for me in  writing that story and in doing that work around exploitation is just the way that we  exploit people in agriculture. I mean, I think there's obvious examples of how we export,  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:38:36):**  you know, farm workers, especially in the United States, but truly all over the world  and throughout pretty much all of time, agricultural labor has been pretty exploited. But, you  know, I think things that we almost wear as like a badge of honor, you know, the number  of young farmers I know who are working 70 or 80 hours a week and don't draw a salary,  that's labor exploitation. I think there's like a, an argument to be made around like  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:39:00):**  the cost of entrepreneurship and the benefits of building a business in the long term. But  the reality is like a lot of those farmers I know who are doing that aren't gonna make,  aren't gonna have a business that can exit, they're not going to gain a bunch of income  at the end of their career when they sell a business. And so they're never going to  get compensated for that labor. Free labor is exploitation. Like that's what that is.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:39:21):**  And I think, you know, we exploit all the people in agricultural systems, whether it's  whether it's, you know, the farmers, whether it's the people, whether or whether it's the  workers, whether it's people adjacent to farmers, like their families. And I think the core  of that is we always overutilize resources we undervalue. And there's an underlying assumption  in agriculture that because of an obsession with bottom line thinking that, you know,  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:39:45):**  prices in agriculture are always given, and that there's nothing you can do about it,  all you can do is control your bottom line control your expenses, because labor is such  a high cost item on balance sheets is just to, as long as you just don't care about it,  you can pay nothing for it, you can pay very little for it, you can certainly pay below  market for it. You know, whether that's your labor you're paying below market for whether  
**[0:40:06-0:40:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:40:06):**  it's like a farm wife's labor who spends dozens of hours a month doing the books for no compensation,  whether it's farm kids, farm kids, like do a lot of labor that they never get compensated  for, you know, farm workers. It just yeah, there's a there's just a lot of exploitation  agriculture that we don't want to talk about, because we chalk it up to this idea of like,  well, you know, there's lifestyle benefits, and there's independence and self reliance  
**[0:40:31-0:40:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:40:31):**  and people just love the labor and it's fine. It's a labor of love. So they're happy to  do it. And I don't know that that how many baseball How many of your kids baseball games  were you happy to miss because you just love farming so much? And so like, I think that  exploitation question, it's, it's provocative. And people really didn't like to hear about  it, to be honest. And I got plenty of comments about how I was like, totally off base and  
**[0:40:54-0:40:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:40:54):**  completely wrong. And agriculture is not inherently exploitative. But, but the reality is, like,  there's evidence everywhere, that that fundamentally, we undervalue ag labor. And I think that's  really hard to argue against. And like, my perception is that like, again, that that  emanates outwards in every direction. And you know what, I think there's a really good  question to be asked about, like, whether that's inherent, whether that's inherent,  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:41:21):**  whether, like, maybe the answer is agriculture just is exploitative, and we can't help it.  And maybe like, you know, that's a reality of being a human being on Earth, who's like,  one job is to feed yourself and not die. But like, if that's the case, if there's no way  for us to, you know, be, quote, unquote, sustainable, let alone regenerative, then we should know  that and confront that reality. And it allows us to ask important questions around ideas  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:41:48):**  like regenerative, where we pretend like, oh, we're not only going to feed ourselves  and everyone really well, and save the world from climate change. Like, is that actually  possible? I don't know, it is a good like, is it actually even possible for the people  involved seems like a good place to start asking that question. And like, as far as  I've seen, on regenerative farms that I know, the equation around labor is no different  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:42:14):**  than on any other farm I've been on. It's just as extractive of the people who do the  work. And like, if you haven't solved that problem, I don't really think you've solved  anything.  It goes back to your, I mean, kind of not the cheerleader, not the enemy, and also just  the windows aspect of like, these are subtle arguments that have two sides. And I don't  
**[0:42:34-0:42:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:42:34):**  sense that you're saying they're not, you're just saying there are some big questions here  that we need to ask an answer.  Yeah, totally. I do feel sad, I guess, sometimes to realize that most people read what I write  wherever they read it, and think that I like must hate agriculture, or that I hate rural,  or that I don't believe it's inherently valuable, because it's that's not true. But I think  
**[0:42:58-0:43:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:42:58):**  it like that in and of itself that like reading someone asking a question feels like hate  that that like is the problem. The problem is, we've created a system that so it's so  lacks resilience, that in questioning it, you threaten its stability, its fundamental  stability. That's not good. Like good, good things, good ideas, good people can take some  questioning, they can take, you know, they can roll with punches, they can adapt and  
**[0:43:32-0:43:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:43:32):**  survive, something that is so fragile, that it can't survive. You wondering something  about it. It's it's not what you think it is. It's not a fortress, this like stronghold  of of idealism. It's a house of cards.  It kind of leads, I guess, to your journey of looking at different leverage points to  be involved in and potentially change or question the system. Your latest one is now not only  
**[0:44:02-0:44:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:44:02):**  not on Twitter, but also going out independently and writing a book. What's your kind of view  of this path as a leverage point? And why have you chosen it as the latest one?  Sure, I am a book nerd myself. I love books. I always have. I always wanted to write a  book, which is a it's just a weird thing to say these days, because now I'm writing a  book and it sucks. What I decided was, you know, the thing that rubs me wrong these days  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:44:33):**  about people who write about ag is that I don't ever want to be the kind of and this  is has always been a struggle for me in journalism. And maybe it's because I didn't go to journalism  school and I come from kind of more of the business side, but I don't ever want to be  someone who's writing about other people's ideas and not trying them. I want to put my  money where my mouth is and vice versa. You know, the book I'm writing is kind of the  
**[0:44:54-0:45:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:44:54):**  the lean startup of of agriculture. You know, me smart ass, if I could build the farm business  that I think would be the most successful, what would it look like? And, you know, who  would I talk to? And how would I inform my decision making? You know, that's what this  book is, is me trying to do that. And then I am very blessed and lucky to get to work  with, you know, I'm actually working with a couple farmers across the country right  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:45:16):**  now to actually try and implement some of the practices that I'm working on most strongly.  I work with Sylvan aqua farms in rural Virginia, and get to work, you know, an active part  of that, or that operation and, you know, have get to not just be talking and researching  and learning about how to organize farm businesses and what the challenges are, I want it to  be a beacon to help me find other people who share these ideas. I mean, the biggest group  
**[0:45:46-0:45:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:45:46):**  of people that I've talked to that, like my ideas, I think are disaffected former farmers,  people who have left ag either failed out or, or left it because it was unsustainable  for them. And I think that group of people like yeah, talk about terrible marketing on  my part, because what a tiny group of people it is, but you know, they, they did, they  did everything they were supposed to do. They were told that in America, small family farms  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:46:15):**  can make it work and communities will rally around you like, you know, farming is possible  in America, it's possible to be a new and beginning or a young farmer. And when people  find that there's like so much more to the story than that, I think that is the most  impactful moment to find them and be like, right, though, those are people who are actually  like distant enough from the fantasy, to be open to hearing that, you know, the fantasy  
**[0:46:43-0:46:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:46:43):**  isn't the full story. And I love those people, because I feel very much like that the part  of that refugee group, so to say, of people who have worked on farms or lived on farms,  but do not any longer, I, in a lot of ways, like, feel like I owe it to those people.  And I owe it to everyone who has ever been excluded from a conversation in agriculture,  or who has ever been told that they didn't get to have a say or that their opinion didn't  
**[0:47:11-0:47:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:47:11):**  matter or that, you know, they should just like buy the product that they were offered  and not worry about it. Those are the those are the people I'm trying to have a conversation  with in the book and elsewhere in the world. And yeah, it's meaningful work. It's work  worth doing. I'm not going to do it forever. And I'm after the book is done, I'm going  to take all my ideas and I'm going to try and make them work. And you know what, if  
**[0:47:36-0:47:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/not-a-cheerleader-not-the-enemy-sarah-mock#t=0:47:36):**  they don't, I guess in like 25 years, I'll write a book about how I was all wrong.

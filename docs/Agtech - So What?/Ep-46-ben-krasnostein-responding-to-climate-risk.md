### Agtech - So What?  (2019-07-23)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:21-0:00:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:00:21):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Today's episode is the third in the theme  
**[0:00:48-0:01:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:00:48):**  responding to climate risk brought to you in partnership with the Australian Farm Institute.  Check out episodes 42 and 44 to hear more about responding to climate risk. Today's  guest is Ben Krasnastien, co-founder and managing director of Kallara Capital, a company that  
**[0:01:04-0:01:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:01:04):**  helps facilitate investment opportunities that provide a commercial return together  with carbon drawdown and emission reduction outcomes. Ben has over 20 years experience  across legal, advisory, commercial transactions, and deal structuring in various industry sectors.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:01:20):**  Ben has always been conscious of the global economy's impact on the environment. And over  the years, he's seen the potential for business to play a role in the shift toward positive  change. I really felt that there was a disconnect with the way that we were relating as a global  
**[0:01:34-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:01:34):**  community to land and the way that our economies have been structured for so long. It's all  been around extraction and consuming rather than around regenerating and pro-suming. And  that's something that in this current business, I really want to drive forward. Can we create  
**[0:01:49-0:02:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:01:49):**  and how do we create opportunities for investment and for outcomes and for community and for  environment that are not uncommercial, in fact, they're inherently commercial, but that also  focus on improving the very ground or planet upon which we operate. Because my belief is  
**[0:02:05-0:02:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:05):**  that in this transition to a low carbon world, there are massive opportunities for economic  growth, employment, community development, wealth creation, potentially the likes of  which we haven't seen since the Industrial Revolution.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:17):**  While Ben is positive about the future, he acknowledges that there are still some major  hurdles to overcome.  One of the issues that we face, I suppose, is that politically and through certain media  
**[0:02:28-0:02:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:28):**  channels, this transition is portrayed as a negative or a cost-bearing problem. It's  just not the case at all in our view. We just think that there are huge opportunities. And  I think the global community recognizes that as well. It's a really important shift that  
**[0:02:44-0:02:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:44):**  we need to make and we can make it in a way that provides for growth. But growth that's  starting to give back to the natural capital that we've used. We've used up our budget  and we now need to start figuring out how we can deliver growth without doing that anymore.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:58):**  Yeah. I wanted to ask you about that kind of perception issue. Is the current work you're  doing still seen as a Bohemian in some way, to use that original term, and kind of a fluffy  hippie kind of thing or focused on costs? Or how have you kind of seen the space changing  
**[0:03:17-0:03:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:17):**  from an investment perspective?  Over the last five years in particular, it's changed a lot. I still think there is a big  perception that you have to be having a scarf on your head and a beard and a hippie shirt  
**[0:03:26-0:03:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:26):**  on. It's just not the case at all. And I think more and more people are starting to understand  what that looks like. And the carbon investments that we're making as a segue is probably a  really good example of it.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:37):**  Ben has two examples of companies that are challenging the model that commercial returns  and impact are at odds. The first is a company called Climate Friendly.  They are a business that try to deliver multiple income and productivity benefits for land  
**[0:03:50-0:04:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:50):**  management or agricultural activity. So landowners or agricultural businesses that own larger  assets across the country. So, you know, the example there is farmers or agricultural producers  or foresters or traditional custodians who run significant-sized properties tapping into  
**[0:04:09-0:04:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:04:09):**  carbon farming activities. So carbon farmers, in inverted commas, either remove carbon from  the atmosphere and store it in the land or prevent greenhouse gases from entering the  atmosphere in the first place. And there's a number of approved methods that have been  
**[0:04:22-0:04:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:04:22):**  set out and validated by the federal government pursuant to federal initiatives, which allow  those farmers and landowners to access income streams.  If I'm a farmer and I want to use Climate Friendly or get involved, what's an example?  
**[0:04:35-0:04:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:04:35):**  So an example is one of the largest methodologies which is used under the government's fund  is called human-induced regeneration. So that's allowing and facilitating the regeneration,  for example, of native bush across large areas of one's land to simply grow back sequestered  
**[0:04:52-0:05:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:04:52):**  carbon as a result and revegetate large swaths of land. And there's a methodology that exists  pursuant to the federal regulations, which says that if you do that across a certain  number of hectares, that equates to a certain amount of CO2e, carbon dioxide equivalent,  
**[0:05:08-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:05:08):**  and the price for a tonne of CO2e is X dollars. And for the amount of CO2e that you either  sequester or avoid, in this case sequester, we will pay you. That's the government scheme  in a nutshell. And the way that that scheme works is that the farmer, or in this case  
**[0:05:23-0:05:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:05:23):**  Climate Friendly, on behalf of the farmer will approach the government and say, we have  an initiative here which fits the methodology. We estimate that this farmer will be able  to deliver 1,000 tonnes of CO2e per annum. Usually it's a lot more than that, but just  
**[0:05:38-0:05:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:05:38):**  using a number. And that farmer is prepared to receive a price for that carbon of X dollars.  And it's done on a reverse auction basis out of the government emissions reduction fund,  now re-coined and rephrased, I think the climate solutions fund, into which the government's  
**[0:05:54-0:06:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:05:54):**  put $2 billion previously, and it's said they'll put another $2 billion. So essentially,  what that is, is the government paying for emissions reduction outcomes. The government  is saying, here's $2 billion, and now another $2 billion, the lowest bidder into that auction  
**[0:06:06-0:06:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:06:06):**  process, which happens I think once every three or four months, will receive the contract.  We guarantee to pay that amount for 10 years to you, Mr. Farmer, so long as you allow the  native bush to grow back, put it simply, and don't touch it, don't cut it down, and don't  
**[0:06:22-0:06:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:06:22):**  clear it. And there's a very, very reliable income stream, therefore, which flows to the  farmer. The business like Climate Friendly acts as the procurer and enabler of that to happen.  So the farmer himself or herself or the corporate who may not be proficient in doing so is able to  
**[0:06:37-0:06:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:06:37):**  tap into that revenue stream. And Climate Friendly then sits in the middle and makes sure that the  contracts have negotiated properly, that the process and the compliance and the auditing  and the monitoring each year happens precisely, and that the farmer is actually delivering on  
**[0:06:53-0:07:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:06:53):**  the amount of carbon that they should be, and then they get paid a certain amount per ton for  doing so. So it's a simple way of describing the business model, and it's a very reliable income  stream, clearly, as a government-backed revenue stream that goes to the farmer and Climate Friendly  
**[0:07:06-0:07:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:07:06):**  flips the ticket, if you like. Consumers especially, but us all generally wanting  better environmental outcomes. I would say there's two challenges. One is around making it  economically possible for farmers, and when we talk about being climate change resilient and  
**[0:07:21-0:07:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:07:21):**  transitioning to a carbon neutral economy, we have to make it profitable. The dollars and  cents have to add up. And the other is around the kind of validation and verification of practices,  like wanting to have more than just a belief that good practices are being done, but actually have  
**[0:07:36-0:07:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:07:36):**  some kind of data or confidence that good practices are being done. Do you have any comments  generally on that? And it sounds like you're solving at least the economic viability question,  but maybe not the kind of data verification aspect of it. Yeah, very good question. Firstly,  
**[0:07:53-0:08:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:07:53):**  the systems that are set up to ensure that these emissions reductions outcomes are occurring on  land are science-based. Sometimes too scientific, in a sense, because the methodologies that the  government has put in place are too complex and too difficult for farmers to create carbon from  
**[0:08:11-0:08:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:08:11):**  those processes. So there is a problem there in terms of sometimes there's too much verification  required. And the soil carbon methodology is an example of that, where we think there needs to be  some relaxation of the way in which that method is able to generate the credit, the Australian  
**[0:08:27-0:08:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:08:27):**  carbon credit unit, because there are enormous outcomes occurring on land on various different  projects that we know about that are not able to be monetised because of the difficulty in  creating that unit. It's too expensive, essentially, because we're talking now  
**[0:08:44-0:08:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:08:44):**  in basic terms about creating a unit of something. And if you can't create a unit of something in a  cost-effective manner, then you can't monetise it because you can't sell it in a cost-effective  manner or for a cost-effective price. And that's really what I think is important for people to  
**[0:08:59-0:09:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:08:59):**  remember. We are creating units of carbon. What you're saying is basically that it can be too  expensive for farmers to do the practice they need to do to get enough carbon, for example,  in the soil where they can actually sell that carbon credit. And so the practice needs to  
**[0:09:14-0:09:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:09:14):**  become less expensive or you need to pay them more. That's almost exactly right. The only tweak  to that comment, Sarah, is that it's not so much that it's expensive to create the soil carbon. It  can be in some practices, but it's not so much that it's expensive to create the soil carbon.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:09:30):**  It's expensive to measure it and monitor it in a way that the government will then say,  that's valid and I'll pay you for it. There's a lot of farmers out there today who are  actually demonstrating that they are developing soil carbon, but in order for them to get paid  
**[0:09:46-0:10:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:09:46):**  by the government, they've got to go around and here's the example and take soil samples  from every 100 metres or 100 square metres, which is just simply impractical across 10,000 hectares.  That's a crude way of saying it. It's not necessarily the numbers, but that's the point.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:10:02):**  There needs to be a way to actually monetize the carbon that we know is being created in a much  more effective way because it's too expensive to produce that unit if you've got to go and pay for  soil samples across 10,000 hectares every 100 metres. And what do you see as the solutions or  
**[0:10:18-0:10:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:10:18):**  are you seeing solutions to this? One that strikes me is satellite imagery and the ability  to use some of the advanced technologies to solve that problem. Indeed, in other parts of the world,  Canada is an example where there are some companies that have developed very efficient  
**[0:10:33-0:10:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:10:33):**  methods of analyzing that data, but indeed the regulations over there allow the creation of,  for example, soil carbon if we're on that topic, via the use of data rather than the use of soil  sampling. Again, that's a crude way of looking at the problem. If indeed we had a system here  
**[0:10:50-0:11:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:10:50):**  that was scientifically based that allowed us to map a baseline across a certain part of  farmers land initially and say, okay, there's that much soil carbon in there now, let's use data and  let's use technology to then go and measure that over time. That is an example where technology can  
**[0:11:04-0:11:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:11:04):**  leap into this to help and drive the change and there's a lot of technology that's around there  that can assist us in doing that. But that's only in relation to the soil carbon issue, but I think  it's worth mentioning and highlighting the soil carbon issue because soil is our sponge. We can  
**[0:11:18-0:11:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:11:18):**  hold three times more carbon in the soil than there is in the atmosphere today. So, we're  in the atmosphere today. So, it is an enormous store of carbon and it's an enormous potential  store of carbon if we get it right and we have the technology to get it right. I mean, the technology  
**[0:11:33-0:11:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:11:33):**  is the oldest technology in the world, it's essentially photosynthesis to draw carbon into soil.  Now, that's a little bit of a metaphor or a little bit of a crude analogy because there are other  ways other than photosynthesis to get carbon back into soil and grazing in a holistic manner is one  
**[0:11:48-0:12:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:11:48):**  of those methods where if you use and employ the right techniques with livestock, you can start to  take degraded land and make it healthy again by virtue of certain techniques. It's probably  outside the scope of this podcast, but there's a number of ways we can use our global volume of  
**[0:12:05-0:12:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:12:05):**  soil to sequester way more carbon than exists in the atmosphere. So, I think it's important for  people to understand that that's one point about soil carbon that's crucial. So, the economics have  been remarkable, but unfortunately in many cases the cost of monitoring remains an impediment.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:12:20):**  That said, it's not just the economic benefits that we're after with the sequestering of carbon.  Many of these practices also have big benefits to productivity. It's this virtuous cycle that Ben  is really excited about. The other thing that of course occurs is that our soils become more  
**[0:12:35-0:12:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:12:35):**  healthy because soils need carbon. The higher the carbon content of soils, the more productive they  are and if we have more productive soils, we've got better crop yields and not only better crop  yields, but healthier crop yields. So, we're talking about a very, very virtuous cycle here  
**[0:12:47-0:13:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:12:47):**  that doesn't just exist to reduce emissions and pay land owners for doing so. It starts to feed  in to an extremely productive and healthy food system and you really are creating a new version  of events if, as you point out, you can ensure that it's verifiable, ensure that these results  
**[0:13:13-0:13:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:13:13):**  are actually happening and no one's gaming the system. You've created a very, very interesting  positive feedback loop. One of the best examples today of a scheme where we can certify on-farm  practices and connect these practices to consumers is with organic. But, as we've heard previously  
**[0:13:30-0:13:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:13:30):**  on the podcast, organic certification can be cost prohibitive for farmers. And another challenge is  that we don't always have ways to verify if the practices are better for the environment. To us  and to Fintech, this seems like an opportunity where technology can play a big role. I asked  
**[0:13:46-0:13:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:13:46):**  Ben for his thoughts as well. That's interesting. I think two comments. One is that I think you're  seeing a lot of evidence that at the US and here in Australia, we know some guys who are doing a  lot of good work in this space. You're seeing a lot of evidence you're creating a much healthier  
**[0:13:59-0:14:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:13:59):**  and higher yielding and therefore more profitable food production system by ensuring that your soils  are healthier. So, again, it's probably outside the scope of this podcast, but I'm more than happy  to continue the conversation or indeed provide some links back to some information on that front.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:15):**  Do you mean about organic or about the soil carbon?  Yeah. I mean, both when it comes to organic farming, holistic farming,  biodynamic farming, regenerative farming, that whole non-industrialized model of farming,  
**[0:14:27-0:14:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:27):**  I think there's a lot of evidence out there, which would suggest that it's worth doing what  it takes to convert to organics or convert to biodynamics or indeed spend some more money to  ensure that your farm transitions away from an industrialized model, which is very expensive and  
**[0:14:40-0:14:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:40):**  risky and socially divisive in certain parts of the world. But I think if you look at the science  and you look at the economics and the evidence that's starting to emerge, it absolutely makes  sense. And there's guys who are much more involved and have more expertise in those levels of detail  
**[0:14:54-0:15:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:54):**  than I do. The second point I'll make though, which is really interesting one that you raised,  is how do you connect consumers to this story? And that's a great segue into the next business that  we're getting involved with and raising capital for. Ben is talking about a business called  
**[0:15:09-0:15:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:15:09):**  Tasman Environmental Markets. Their mission is to connect consumers and corporates with projects  globally that have emissions reductions outcomes. So this business, most people would be familiar  with the idea of ticking a box when you fly on an airline, fly carbon neutral. When you go on  
**[0:15:28-0:15:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:15:28):**  the Qantas website, for example, and you tick fly carbon neutral, that has been enabled and created  by this business that we're investing into, that we're really excited about. That's been done,  of course, with the help and the assistance of Qantas, who are really driving this space forward  
**[0:15:42-0:15:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:15:42):**  from an airline industry perspective and a corporate perspective here in Australia.  That's one way where we can start to see consumers by ticking that box, being able to do two things.  One, lower their own footprint from flying and two, connect with projects that our guys have  
**[0:15:58-0:16:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:15:58):**  been able to procure carbon from and you start to see a really powerful solution to climate change  and emissions reduction outcomes. I asked Ben about one of the arguments I've heard against  this kind of approach. Basically, is buying an offset the same as paying to absolve your sins?  
**[0:16:17-0:16:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:16:17):**  You've still committed the sin, so is this really a good intervention?  Yeah, we get upset all the time. That's a great question and we've thought about it very deeply  because we want to make sure that what we do and where we flow our opportunities and capital into  
**[0:16:30-0:16:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:16:30):**  actually have those outcomes. There's a couple of comments I'd make. One is that for a business like  this one, the more it scales, the more it is able to channel in terms of corporate and consumer  dollars into projects. If you believe as we do that the projects that they're touching  
**[0:16:47-0:17:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:16:47):**  are very real, the more outcomes you are having on land and on communities. The founders give a  really beautiful example of one of the projects that they've looked at and continually looking at  and have invested in in Papua New Guinea where they've travelled to and spent time with  
**[0:17:06-0:17:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:17:06):**  communities in really wild remote locations and have seen the outcomes of the investments that  are being made into those regions. These communities are not only getting paid to protect  native forest and rainforest but indeed that's what's happening. In other words,  
**[0:17:24-0:17:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:17:24):**  that native rainforest is there as a carbon store going forward and it is not able to be cleared,  is not able to be cut down. There are community benefits that are enormous to the locals who are  able to sustain themselves and continue to exist in that land and on their land. The direct result  
**[0:17:45-0:18:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:17:45):**  of this business connecting consumers and corporates with those projects is that you  are not only having these carbon sequestration outcomes and protection of huge amounts of  biodiversity but you've got communities that are able to connect back with that on the ground and  
**[0:18:01-0:18:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:18:01):**  receive income for doing it. There's another example where that's happening in New Zealand  for some of the First Nations there. That's one comment I'll make. If we tick the box,  and I don't mean in the in the bicarbon neutral sense, but if we tick the box that we believe  
**[0:18:15-0:18:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:18:15):**  these companies and these founders are actually ensuring by due diligence and verification that  the projects that they're procuring carbon from or indeed promoting are very real, then by extension  every dollar that we put through that ends up creating and enabling these type of outcomes. It  
**[0:18:34-0:18:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:18:34):**  scales these abatement processes enormously in our view. The second comment I'll make is this,  is that perfection can be the enemy of progress. If we wait to get a system that is perfect,  well we already know that it's too late. We need to ensure that we're behaving in a responsible  
**[0:18:51-0:19:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:18:51):**  manner in relation to the projects we're talking about here. But again, if we sign off on that and  we agree all of those projects are real, and they could be a wind turbine project in India generating  renewable energy, that's another way that you can get paid because you're avoiding generation of  
**[0:19:03-0:19:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:19:03):**  energy from fossil fuels. And if we believe that in promoting the sectors by connecting them with  consumers and corporates contribute to emissions reductions, which we know they do, we know wind  farms and solar farms, protection of forests, many other methodologies do that, do have those  
**[0:19:17-0:19:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:19:17):**  effects, then we need to get going on it. And that's what I mean by perfection is the enemy  of progress. So we are saying look, like using your church example, if you are a large corporate  emitter and you are the devil and you are pumping and bilging smoke and pollution and CO2 equivalent  
**[0:19:34-0:19:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:19:34):**  into the atmosphere, and you know that you're going to have to transition away from that in the  next 10, 20, 30 years, because that's just where the world's headed. We know that too, fossil fuels  are on the way out, but there is a transition that is and needs to take place. No one can or  
**[0:19:48-0:20:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:19:48):**  would suggest that we can turn off every coal plant tomorrow. We know that it's going to take  time. And if you add up the emissions trajectory or the emissions output from all of those coal  producers or gas producers over the next 10 years, say, let's say that's the transition and that adds  
**[0:20:04-0:20:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:20:04):**  up to a certain amount of carbon that's being spilled out to the atmosphere. And we do nothing  with respect to offsetting. We have our emissions and we know what that volume is in 10 years time.  If we do something and we allow those corporates to offset, knowing that in any event they're going  
**[0:20:17-0:20:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:20:17):**  to transition because they have to and they will, maybe it's 15 years, no rather than 10.  If we allow offsetting to occur, and as I said before, we ensure that the projects are real and  valid, then your net emissions profile, it will inherently has to be lower at the end of that  
**[0:20:31-0:20:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:20:31):**  transitional period. For those 10 years, you've ensured that you've protected a certain amount of  rainforest. You've built a certain amount of renewable energy. You've sequestered a certain  amount in soil carbon projects. You've paid for reductions in sediment and nitrogen runoff into  
**[0:20:45-0:21:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:20:45):**  the Barrier Reef. That's another example of where you can put your money. Clearly, from our point  of view, my personal point of view, we're achieving something really important. And whilst I get it,  that there is a bit of a syndrome amongst humans, that yes, if we pay for our sin, we can just go  
**[0:21:00-0:21:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:21:00):**  and sin again and pay for it again, or we can feel better about just doing that and then continuing  to emit. I get that syndrome. However, we have to find a way to connect people who want to connect  with those projects who otherwise can't do it. And there are a number of people that will do both,  
**[0:21:16-0:21:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:21:16):**  in our view. You'll start offsetting and you'll start reducing at the source. And I think both  are incredibly important. I think it's very difficult to determine what is more important.  Is it more important to offset globally now, or is it more important to reduce and mitigate  
**[0:21:32-0:21:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:21:32):**  in the first place? Not mitigate against it, but mitigate in the first place. So,  yeah, we can then start getting into economic conversations about when the cost  of a boatman is high enough, will people emit in the first place? And there's a very strong  
**[0:21:45-0:22:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:21:45):**  argument there too. So we need these carbon markets, in my view. We need companies that  are able to connect consumers with this market. We need people to be able to simply trade in  environmental markets and products that end up having these outcomes, because I do believe that  
**[0:22:00-0:22:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:00):**  that's the way we can transition our economy. And it's not perfect, but if we don't start,  it all gets a bit late. Ben is really hopeful about the future, especially as we can continue  to be quantitative to measure impact and use economic incentives to drive change. This will  
**[0:22:16-0:22:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:16):**  help to continue to move away from stereotypes about impact being for bohemians and hippies.  For Ben, measurement is critical and the concept of a CO2 equivalent is a good example.  So a tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent is a tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent is a tonne of  
**[0:22:31-0:22:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:31):**  carbon dioxide equivalent, no matter where you are. A tonne of carbon dioxide in the soil in  Australia, if measured correctly, is the same as a tonne of carbon dioxide in the soil in Malaysia,  which is the same as in South America, which is the same in the UK. A megawatt hour, which is  
**[0:22:43-0:22:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:43):**  broadly equivalent to a tonne of carbon, so a megawatt hour of renewable energy, which is  broadly equivalent to a tonne of CO2e, is the same whether it's from a wind farm project in India or  a wind farm project or a solar project in Queensland. And it's therefore quite ubiquitous  
**[0:22:58-0:23:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:58):**  and measurable and tradable. So we have a unit of measurement that is inherently linked and related  to the health of the planet that if dealt with fairly and equitably and commercially,  creates enormous outcomes both for wealth creation for investors and for planet because,  
**[0:23:17-0:23:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:23:17):**  as I said before, if these projects are working then there is a benefit to environment, an enormous  one, and to communities. So I think it's a really important concept. It shifts the conversation  away from the what if or the maybes or the we'll get the qualitative conversation around impacts  
**[0:23:35-0:23:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:23:35):**  to a completely quantifiable, a completely commercial and a completely tradable conversation.  And that's why we say, well, you don't have to be a convert to the green economy. This is just  a new normal. This is just the way this is going to function. And so if you wake up in the morning  
**[0:23:48-0:24:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:23:48):**  not really caring so much about nature of the environment, I think we've seen that recently  happen in this country at the election, both from voters and politicians. Then if we've created a  new normal, it doesn't much matter because everybody going to work and everybody consuming  
**[0:24:02-0:24:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:02):**  will be inherently connected to these regenerative outcomes rather than these extractive outcomes.  That's ultimately where we're headed and where we're aiming to head.  I love that the point you made before, like you, it's not just that it's normal for people  
**[0:24:15-0:24:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:15):**  and we don't have to think about it in our day to day decisions, but also that it's profitable  for different projects and especially for farmers because without that aspect then you can't get  those economics to work. And so I so appreciate the focus on that because so much of this  
**[0:24:29-0:24:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:29):**  conversation often misses the expense at the end of the line for the people making the change.  Yeah, that's right.  Ben, thank you so much for joining me. I really appreciate this. I definitely  
**[0:24:38-0:24:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:38):**  ask things that are interesting to me and hopefully we'll find a way to make them  interesting to the audience. So I really appreciate it and hearing your view on this.  It's good to kind of speak out loud about it, to be honest. It's really helpful for me too.  
**[0:24:50-0:25:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:50):**  Oh, well, any time these are my favorite topics to think about. So I'm more than happy to chat.  Fabulous. Excellent.

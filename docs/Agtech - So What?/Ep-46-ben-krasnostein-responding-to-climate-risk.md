### Agtech - So What?  (Tue, 23 Jul 2019 20:56:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:00:11):**  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:00:16):**  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:00:21):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:00:26):**  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  
**[0:00:30-0:00:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:00:30):**  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Today's episode is the third in the theme  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:00:48):**  responding to climate risk brought to you in partnership with the Australian Farm Institute.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:00:53):**  Check out episodes 42 and 44 to hear more about responding to climate risk. Today's  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:00:59):**  guest is Ben Krasnastien, co-founder and managing director of Kallara Capital, a company that  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:01:04):**  helps facilitate investment opportunities that provide a commercial return together  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:01:09):**  with carbon drawdown and emission reduction outcomes. Ben has over 20 years experience  
**[0:01:13-0:01:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:01:13):**  across legal, advisory, commercial transactions, and deal structuring in various industry sectors.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:01:20):**  Ben has always been conscious of the global economy's impact on the environment. And over  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:01:24):**  the years, he's seen the potential for business to play a role in the shift toward positive  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:01:28):**  change. I really felt that there was a disconnect with the way that we were relating as a global  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:01:34):**  community to land and the way that our economies have been structured for so long. It's all  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:01:39):**  been around extraction and consuming rather than around regenerating and pro-suming. And  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:01:45):**  that's something that in this current business, I really want to drive forward. Can we create  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:01:49):**  and how do we create opportunities for investment and for outcomes and for community and for  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:01:54):**  environment that are not uncommercial, in fact, they're inherently commercial, but that also  
**[0:01:59-0:02:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:01:59):**  focus on improving the very ground or planet upon which we operate. Because my belief is  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:05):**  that in this transition to a low carbon world, there are massive opportunities for economic  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:10):**  growth, employment, community development, wealth creation, potentially the likes of  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:15):**  which we haven't seen since the Industrial Revolution.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:17):**  While Ben is positive about the future, he acknowledges that there are still some major  
**[0:02:21-0:02:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:21):**  hurdles to overcome.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:23):**  One of the issues that we face, I suppose, is that politically and through certain media  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:28):**  channels, this transition is portrayed as a negative or a cost-bearing problem. It's  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:34):**  just not the case at all in our view. We just think that there are huge opportunities. And  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:38):**  I think the global community recognizes that as well. It's a really important shift that  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:44):**  we need to make and we can make it in a way that provides for growth. But growth that's  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:50):**  starting to give back to the natural capital that we've used. We've used up our budget  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:54):**  and we now need to start figuring out how we can deliver growth without doing that anymore.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:02:58):**  Yeah. I wanted to ask you about that kind of perception issue. Is the current work you're  
**[0:03:04-0:03:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:04):**  doing still seen as a Bohemian in some way, to use that original term, and kind of a fluffy  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:12):**  hippie kind of thing or focused on costs? Or how have you kind of seen the space changing  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:17):**  from an investment perspective?  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:18):**  Over the last five years in particular, it's changed a lot. I still think there is a big  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:22):**  perception that you have to be having a scarf on your head and a beard and a hippie shirt  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:26):**  on. It's just not the case at all. And I think more and more people are starting to understand  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:30):**  what that looks like. And the carbon investments that we're making as a segue is probably a  
**[0:03:35-0:03:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:35):**  really good example of it.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:37):**  Ben has two examples of companies that are challenging the model that commercial returns  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:40):**  and impact are at odds. The first is a company called Climate Friendly.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:45):**  They are a business that try to deliver multiple income and productivity benefits for land  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:50):**  management or agricultural activity. So landowners or agricultural businesses that own larger  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:03:56):**  assets across the country. So, you know, the example there is farmers or agricultural producers  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:04:02):**  or foresters or traditional custodians who run significant-sized properties tapping into  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:04:09):**  carbon farming activities. So carbon farmers, in inverted commas, either remove carbon from  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:04:14):**  the atmosphere and store it in the land or prevent greenhouse gases from entering the  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:04:18):**  atmosphere in the first place. And there's a number of approved methods that have been  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:04:22):**  set out and validated by the federal government pursuant to federal initiatives, which allow  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:04:27):**  those farmers and landowners to access income streams.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:04:30):**  If I'm a farmer and I want to use Climate Friendly or get involved, what's an example?  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:04:35):**  So an example is one of the largest methodologies which is used under the government's fund  
**[0:04:40-0:04:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:04:40):**  is called human-induced regeneration. So that's allowing and facilitating the regeneration,  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:04:47):**  for example, of native bush across large areas of one's land to simply grow back sequestered  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:04:52):**  carbon as a result and revegetate large swaths of land. And there's a methodology that exists  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:04:58):**  pursuant to the federal regulations, which says that if you do that across a certain  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:05:02):**  number of hectares, that equates to a certain amount of CO2e, carbon dioxide equivalent,  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:05:08):**  and the price for a tonne of CO2e is X dollars. And for the amount of CO2e that you either  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:05:15):**  sequester or avoid, in this case sequester, we will pay you. That's the government scheme  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:05:19):**  in a nutshell. And the way that that scheme works is that the farmer, or in this case  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:05:23):**  Climate Friendly, on behalf of the farmer will approach the government and say, we have  
**[0:05:28-0:05:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:05:28):**  an initiative here which fits the methodology. We estimate that this farmer will be able  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:05:32):**  to deliver 1,000 tonnes of CO2e per annum. Usually it's a lot more than that, but just  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:05:38):**  using a number. And that farmer is prepared to receive a price for that carbon of X dollars.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:05:45):**  And it's done on a reverse auction basis out of the government emissions reduction fund,  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:05:50):**  now re-coined and rephrased, I think the climate solutions fund, into which the government's  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:05:54):**  put $2 billion previously, and it's said they'll put another $2 billion. So essentially,  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:05:58):**  what that is, is the government paying for emissions reduction outcomes. The government  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:06:02):**  is saying, here's $2 billion, and now another $2 billion, the lowest bidder into that auction  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:06:06):**  process, which happens I think once every three or four months, will receive the contract.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:06:11):**  We guarantee to pay that amount for 10 years to you, Mr. Farmer, so long as you allow the  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:06:17):**  native bush to grow back, put it simply, and don't touch it, don't cut it down, and don't  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:06:22):**  clear it. And there's a very, very reliable income stream, therefore, which flows to the  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:06:27):**  farmer. The business like Climate Friendly acts as the procurer and enabler of that to happen.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:06:32):**  So the farmer himself or herself or the corporate who may not be proficient in doing so is able to  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:06:37):**  tap into that revenue stream. And Climate Friendly then sits in the middle and makes sure that the  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:06:42):**  contracts have negotiated properly, that the process and the compliance and the auditing  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:06:48):**  and the monitoring each year happens precisely, and that the farmer is actually delivering on  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:06:53):**  the amount of carbon that they should be, and then they get paid a certain amount per ton for  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:06:57):**  doing so. So it's a simple way of describing the business model, and it's a very reliable income  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:07:02):**  stream, clearly, as a government-backed revenue stream that goes to the farmer and Climate Friendly  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:07:06):**  flips the ticket, if you like. Consumers especially, but us all generally wanting  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:07:11):**  better environmental outcomes. I would say there's two challenges. One is around making it  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:07:16):**  economically possible for farmers, and when we talk about being climate change resilient and  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:07:21):**  transitioning to a carbon neutral economy, we have to make it profitable. The dollars and  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:07:26):**  cents have to add up. And the other is around the kind of validation and verification of practices,  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:07:31):**  like wanting to have more than just a belief that good practices are being done, but actually have  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:07:36):**  some kind of data or confidence that good practices are being done. Do you have any comments  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:07:42):**  generally on that? And it sounds like you're solving at least the economic viability question,  
**[0:07:46-0:07:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:07:46):**  but maybe not the kind of data verification aspect of it. Yeah, very good question. Firstly,  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:07:53):**  the systems that are set up to ensure that these emissions reductions outcomes are occurring on  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:07:58):**  land are science-based. Sometimes too scientific, in a sense, because the methodologies that the  
**[0:08:03-0:08:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:08:03):**  government has put in place are too complex and too difficult for farmers to create carbon from  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:08:11):**  those processes. So there is a problem there in terms of sometimes there's too much verification  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:08:15):**  required. And the soil carbon methodology is an example of that, where we think there needs to be  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:08:21):**  some relaxation of the way in which that method is able to generate the credit, the Australian  
**[0:08:27-0:08:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:08:27):**  carbon credit unit, because there are enormous outcomes occurring on land on various different  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:08:35):**  projects that we know about that are not able to be monetised because of the difficulty in  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:08:40):**  creating that unit. It's too expensive, essentially, because we're talking now  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:08:44):**  in basic terms about creating a unit of something. And if you can't create a unit of something in a  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:08:50):**  cost-effective manner, then you can't monetise it because you can't sell it in a cost-effective  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:08:55):**  manner or for a cost-effective price. And that's really what I think is important for people to  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:08:59):**  remember. We are creating units of carbon. What you're saying is basically that it can be too  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:09:04):**  expensive for farmers to do the practice they need to do to get enough carbon, for example,  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:09:09):**  in the soil where they can actually sell that carbon credit. And so the practice needs to  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:09:14):**  become less expensive or you need to pay them more. That's almost exactly right. The only tweak  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:09:20):**  to that comment, Sarah, is that it's not so much that it's expensive to create the soil carbon. It  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:09:26):**  can be in some practices, but it's not so much that it's expensive to create the soil carbon.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:09:30):**  It's expensive to measure it and monitor it in a way that the government will then say,  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:09:36):**  that's valid and I'll pay you for it. There's a lot of farmers out there today who are  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:09:41):**  actually demonstrating that they are developing soil carbon, but in order for them to get paid  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:09:46):**  by the government, they've got to go around and here's the example and take soil samples  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:09:52):**  from every 100 metres or 100 square metres, which is just simply impractical across 10,000 hectares.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:09:58):**  That's a crude way of saying it. It's not necessarily the numbers, but that's the point.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:10:02):**  There needs to be a way to actually monetize the carbon that we know is being created in a much  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:10:07):**  more effective way because it's too expensive to produce that unit if you've got to go and pay for  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:10:12):**  soil samples across 10,000 hectares every 100 metres. And what do you see as the solutions or  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:10:18):**  are you seeing solutions to this? One that strikes me is satellite imagery and the ability  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:10:23):**  to use some of the advanced technologies to solve that problem. Indeed, in other parts of the world,  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:10:28):**  Canada is an example where there are some companies that have developed very efficient  
**[0:10:33-0:10:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:10:33):**  methods of analyzing that data, but indeed the regulations over there allow the creation of,  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:10:40):**  for example, soil carbon if we're on that topic, via the use of data rather than the use of soil  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:10:45):**  sampling. Again, that's a crude way of looking at the problem. If indeed we had a system here  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:10:50):**  that was scientifically based that allowed us to map a baseline across a certain part of  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:10:54):**  farmers land initially and say, okay, there's that much soil carbon in there now, let's use data and  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:10:58):**  let's use technology to then go and measure that over time. That is an example where technology can  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:11:04):**  leap into this to help and drive the change and there's a lot of technology that's around there  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:11:08):**  that can assist us in doing that. But that's only in relation to the soil carbon issue, but I think  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:11:13):**  it's worth mentioning and highlighting the soil carbon issue because soil is our sponge. We can  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:11:18):**  hold three times more carbon in the soil than there is in the atmosphere today. So, we're  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:11:23):**  in the atmosphere today. So, it is an enormous store of carbon and it's an enormous potential  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:11:28):**  store of carbon if we get it right and we have the technology to get it right. I mean, the technology  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:11:33):**  is the oldest technology in the world, it's essentially photosynthesis to draw carbon into soil.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:11:38):**  Now, that's a little bit of a metaphor or a little bit of a crude analogy because there are other  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:11:43):**  ways other than photosynthesis to get carbon back into soil and grazing in a holistic manner is one  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:11:48):**  of those methods where if you use and employ the right techniques with livestock, you can start to  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:11:55):**  take degraded land and make it healthy again by virtue of certain techniques. It's probably  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:11:59):**  outside the scope of this podcast, but there's a number of ways we can use our global volume of  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:12:05):**  soil to sequester way more carbon than exists in the atmosphere. So, I think it's important for  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:12:09):**  people to understand that that's one point about soil carbon that's crucial. So, the economics have  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:12:15):**  been remarkable, but unfortunately in many cases the cost of monitoring remains an impediment.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:12:20):**  That said, it's not just the economic benefits that we're after with the sequestering of carbon.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:12:25):**  Many of these practices also have big benefits to productivity. It's this virtuous cycle that Ben  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:12:31):**  is really excited about. The other thing that of course occurs is that our soils become more  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:12:35):**  healthy because soils need carbon. The higher the carbon content of soils, the more productive they  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:12:39):**  are and if we have more productive soils, we've got better crop yields and not only better crop  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:12:43):**  yields, but healthier crop yields. So, we're talking about a very, very virtuous cycle here  
**[0:12:47-0:12:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:12:47):**  that doesn't just exist to reduce emissions and pay land owners for doing so. It starts to feed  
**[0:12:56-0:13:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:12:56):**  in to an extremely productive and healthy food system and you really are creating a new version  
**[0:13:04-0:13:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:13:04):**  of events if, as you point out, you can ensure that it's verifiable, ensure that these results  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:13:13):**  are actually happening and no one's gaming the system. You've created a very, very interesting  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:13:18):**  positive feedback loop. One of the best examples today of a scheme where we can certify on-farm  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:13:24):**  practices and connect these practices to consumers is with organic. But, as we've heard previously  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:13:30):**  on the podcast, organic certification can be cost prohibitive for farmers. And another challenge is  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:13:36):**  that we don't always have ways to verify if the practices are better for the environment. To us  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:13:41):**  and to Fintech, this seems like an opportunity where technology can play a big role. I asked  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:13:46):**  Ben for his thoughts as well. That's interesting. I think two comments. One is that I think you're  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:13:51):**  seeing a lot of evidence that at the US and here in Australia, we know some guys who are doing a  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:13:54):**  lot of good work in this space. You're seeing a lot of evidence you're creating a much healthier  
**[0:13:59-0:14:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:13:59):**  and higher yielding and therefore more profitable food production system by ensuring that your soils  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:06):**  are healthier. So, again, it's probably outside the scope of this podcast, but I'm more than happy  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:10):**  to continue the conversation or indeed provide some links back to some information on that front.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:15):**  Do you mean about organic or about the soil carbon?  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:17):**  Yeah. I mean, both when it comes to organic farming, holistic farming,  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:21):**  biodynamic farming, regenerative farming, that whole non-industrialized model of farming,  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:27):**  I think there's a lot of evidence out there, which would suggest that it's worth doing what  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:31):**  it takes to convert to organics or convert to biodynamics or indeed spend some more money to  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:36):**  ensure that your farm transitions away from an industrialized model, which is very expensive and  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:40):**  risky and socially divisive in certain parts of the world. But I think if you look at the science  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:44):**  and you look at the economics and the evidence that's starting to emerge, it absolutely makes  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:48):**  sense. And there's guys who are much more involved and have more expertise in those levels of detail  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:54):**  than I do. The second point I'll make though, which is really interesting one that you raised,  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:14:58):**  is how do you connect consumers to this story? And that's a great segue into the next business that  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:15:04):**  we're getting involved with and raising capital for. Ben is talking about a business called  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:15:09):**  Tasman Environmental Markets. Their mission is to connect consumers and corporates with projects  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:15:15):**  globally that have emissions reductions outcomes. So this business, most people would be familiar  
**[0:15:21-0:15:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:15:21):**  with the idea of ticking a box when you fly on an airline, fly carbon neutral. When you go on  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:15:28):**  the Qantas website, for example, and you tick fly carbon neutral, that has been enabled and created  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:15:32):**  by this business that we're investing into, that we're really excited about. That's been done,  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:15:37):**  of course, with the help and the assistance of Qantas, who are really driving this space forward  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:15:42):**  from an airline industry perspective and a corporate perspective here in Australia.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:15:47):**  That's one way where we can start to see consumers by ticking that box, being able to do two things.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:15:53):**  One, lower their own footprint from flying and two, connect with projects that our guys have  
**[0:15:58-0:16:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:15:58):**  been able to procure carbon from and you start to see a really powerful solution to climate change  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:16:06):**  and emissions reduction outcomes. I asked Ben about one of the arguments I've heard against  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:16:11):**  this kind of approach. Basically, is buying an offset the same as paying to absolve your sins?  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:16:17):**  You've still committed the sin, so is this really a good intervention?  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:16:21):**  Yeah, we get upset all the time. That's a great question and we've thought about it very deeply  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:16:25):**  because we want to make sure that what we do and where we flow our opportunities and capital into  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:16:30):**  actually have those outcomes. There's a couple of comments I'd make. One is that for a business like  
**[0:16:35-0:16:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:16:35):**  this one, the more it scales, the more it is able to channel in terms of corporate and consumer  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:16:42):**  dollars into projects. If you believe as we do that the projects that they're touching  
**[0:16:47-0:16:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:16:47):**  are very real, the more outcomes you are having on land and on communities. The founders give a  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:16:56):**  really beautiful example of one of the projects that they've looked at and continually looking at  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:17:01):**  and have invested in in Papua New Guinea where they've travelled to and spent time with  
**[0:17:06-0:17:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:17:06):**  communities in really wild remote locations and have seen the outcomes of the investments that  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:17:14):**  are being made into those regions. These communities are not only getting paid to protect  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:17:19):**  native forest and rainforest but indeed that's what's happening. In other words,  
**[0:17:24-0:17:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:17:24):**  that native rainforest is there as a carbon store going forward and it is not able to be cleared,  
**[0:17:31-0:17:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:17:31):**  is not able to be cut down. There are community benefits that are enormous to the locals who are  
**[0:17:38-0:17:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:17:38):**  able to sustain themselves and continue to exist in that land and on their land. The direct result  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:17:45):**  of this business connecting consumers and corporates with those projects is that you  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:17:49):**  are not only having these carbon sequestration outcomes and protection of huge amounts of  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:17:55):**  biodiversity but you've got communities that are able to connect back with that on the ground and  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:18:01):**  receive income for doing it. There's another example where that's happening in New Zealand  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:18:05):**  for some of the First Nations there. That's one comment I'll make. If we tick the box,  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:18:10):**  and I don't mean in the in the bicarbon neutral sense, but if we tick the box that we believe  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:18:15):**  these companies and these founders are actually ensuring by due diligence and verification that  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:18:21):**  the projects that they're procuring carbon from or indeed promoting are very real, then by extension  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:18:27):**  every dollar that we put through that ends up creating and enabling these type of outcomes. It  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:18:34):**  scales these abatement processes enormously in our view. The second comment I'll make is this,  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:18:39):**  is that perfection can be the enemy of progress. If we wait to get a system that is perfect,  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:18:45):**  well we already know that it's too late. We need to ensure that we're behaving in a responsible  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:18:51):**  manner in relation to the projects we're talking about here. But again, if we sign off on that and  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:18:55):**  we agree all of those projects are real, and they could be a wind turbine project in India generating  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:18:59):**  renewable energy, that's another way that you can get paid because you're avoiding generation of  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:19:03):**  energy from fossil fuels. And if we believe that in promoting the sectors by connecting them with  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:19:09):**  consumers and corporates contribute to emissions reductions, which we know they do, we know wind  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:19:13):**  farms and solar farms, protection of forests, many other methodologies do that, do have those  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:19:17):**  effects, then we need to get going on it. And that's what I mean by perfection is the enemy  
**[0:19:21-0:19:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:19:21):**  of progress. So we are saying look, like using your church example, if you are a large corporate  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:19:28):**  emitter and you are the devil and you are pumping and bilging smoke and pollution and CO2 equivalent  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:19:34):**  into the atmosphere, and you know that you're going to have to transition away from that in the  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:19:39):**  next 10, 20, 30 years, because that's just where the world's headed. We know that too, fossil fuels  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:19:44):**  are on the way out, but there is a transition that is and needs to take place. No one can or  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:19:48):**  would suggest that we can turn off every coal plant tomorrow. We know that it's going to take  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:19:53):**  time. And if you add up the emissions trajectory or the emissions output from all of those coal  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:19:58):**  producers or gas producers over the next 10 years, say, let's say that's the transition and that adds  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:20:04):**  up to a certain amount of carbon that's being spilled out to the atmosphere. And we do nothing  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:20:08):**  with respect to offsetting. We have our emissions and we know what that volume is in 10 years time.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:20:12):**  If we do something and we allow those corporates to offset, knowing that in any event they're going  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:20:17):**  to transition because they have to and they will, maybe it's 15 years, no rather than 10.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:20:22):**  If we allow offsetting to occur, and as I said before, we ensure that the projects are real and  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:20:26):**  valid, then your net emissions profile, it will inherently has to be lower at the end of that  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:20:31):**  transitional period. For those 10 years, you've ensured that you've protected a certain amount of  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:20:35):**  rainforest. You've built a certain amount of renewable energy. You've sequestered a certain  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:20:39):**  amount in soil carbon projects. You've paid for reductions in sediment and nitrogen runoff into  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:20:45):**  the Barrier Reef. That's another example of where you can put your money. Clearly, from our point  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:20:50):**  of view, my personal point of view, we're achieving something really important. And whilst I get it,  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:20:55):**  that there is a bit of a syndrome amongst humans, that yes, if we pay for our sin, we can just go  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:21:00):**  and sin again and pay for it again, or we can feel better about just doing that and then continuing  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:21:04):**  to emit. I get that syndrome. However, we have to find a way to connect people who want to connect  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:21:10):**  with those projects who otherwise can't do it. And there are a number of people that will do both,  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:21:16):**  in our view. You'll start offsetting and you'll start reducing at the source. And I think both  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:21:21):**  are incredibly important. I think it's very difficult to determine what is more important.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:21:26):**  Is it more important to offset globally now, or is it more important to reduce and mitigate  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:21:32):**  in the first place? Not mitigate against it, but mitigate in the first place. So,  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:21:37):**  yeah, we can then start getting into economic conversations about when the cost  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:21:41):**  of a boatman is high enough, will people emit in the first place? And there's a very strong  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:21:45):**  argument there too. So we need these carbon markets, in my view. We need companies that  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:21:50):**  are able to connect consumers with this market. We need people to be able to simply trade in  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:21:55):**  environmental markets and products that end up having these outcomes, because I do believe that  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:00):**  that's the way we can transition our economy. And it's not perfect, but if we don't start,  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:05):**  it all gets a bit late. Ben is really hopeful about the future, especially as we can continue  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:10):**  to be quantitative to measure impact and use economic incentives to drive change. This will  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:16):**  help to continue to move away from stereotypes about impact being for bohemians and hippies.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:21):**  For Ben, measurement is critical and the concept of a CO2 equivalent is a good example.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:27):**  So a tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent is a tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent is a tonne of  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:31):**  carbon dioxide equivalent, no matter where you are. A tonne of carbon dioxide in the soil in  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:35):**  Australia, if measured correctly, is the same as a tonne of carbon dioxide in the soil in Malaysia,  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:39):**  which is the same as in South America, which is the same in the UK. A megawatt hour, which is  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:43):**  broadly equivalent to a tonne of carbon, so a megawatt hour of renewable energy, which is  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:47):**  broadly equivalent to a tonne of CO2e, is the same whether it's from a wind farm project in India or  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:53):**  a wind farm project or a solar project in Queensland. And it's therefore quite ubiquitous  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:22:58):**  and measurable and tradable. So we have a unit of measurement that is inherently linked and related  
**[0:23:04-0:23:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:23:04):**  to the health of the planet that if dealt with fairly and equitably and commercially,  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:23:11):**  creates enormous outcomes both for wealth creation for investors and for planet because,  
**[0:23:17-0:23:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:23:17):**  as I said before, if these projects are working then there is a benefit to environment, an enormous  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:23:23):**  one, and to communities. So I think it's a really important concept. It shifts the conversation  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:23:28):**  away from the what if or the maybes or the we'll get the qualitative conversation around impacts  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:23:35):**  to a completely quantifiable, a completely commercial and a completely tradable conversation.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:23:40):**  And that's why we say, well, you don't have to be a convert to the green economy. This is just  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:23:44):**  a new normal. This is just the way this is going to function. And so if you wake up in the morning  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:23:48):**  not really caring so much about nature of the environment, I think we've seen that recently  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:23:53):**  happen in this country at the election, both from voters and politicians. Then if we've created a  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:23:58):**  new normal, it doesn't much matter because everybody going to work and everybody consuming  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:02):**  will be inherently connected to these regenerative outcomes rather than these extractive outcomes.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:07):**  That's ultimately where we're headed and where we're aiming to head.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:10):**  I love that the point you made before, like you, it's not just that it's normal for people  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:15):**  and we don't have to think about it in our day to day decisions, but also that it's profitable  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:19):**  for different projects and especially for farmers because without that aspect then you can't get  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:24):**  those economics to work. And so I so appreciate the focus on that because so much of this  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:29):**  conversation often misses the expense at the end of the line for the people making the change.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:34):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:35):**  Ben, thank you so much for joining me. I really appreciate this. I definitely

**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:41):**  interesting to the audience. So I really appreciate it and hearing your view on this.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:46):**  It's good to kind of speak out loud about it, to be honest. It's really helpful for me too.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=399884#t=0:24:50):**  Oh, well, any time these are my favorite topics to think about. So I'm more than happy to chat.

### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:01:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:00:11):**  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:00:16):**  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:00:21):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:00:26):**  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  
**[0:00:30-0:00:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:00:30):**  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. Today's guest is Tim Hammarich. Tim is the  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:00:48):**  founder of AgGrad, an American recruiting company that specializes in agribusiness and  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:00:53):**  ag tech. Tim is also the host of the Future of Agriculture podcast, which you should definitely  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:00:59):**  check out. Tim and I chat about a few things, some challenges he's seeing ag tech companies  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:01:05):**  struggle with, tips for getting a job, and some of Tim's ideas for how we can attract  
**[0:01:10-0:01:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:01:10):**  and train more talented young people in agriculture. As usual, Tim starts with his background.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:01:17):**  I grew up in Northern California on a hobby farm and so got a good taste of sort of direct  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:01:22):**  to consumer agriculture. We sold pigs and goats and ducks for Hispanic and Asian markets  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:01:28):**  specifically straight out of our little five acre farm. And from there, I tried to do everything  
**[0:01:33-0:01:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:01:33):**  I could to position myself well from the FFA program and livestock judging and national  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:01:39):**  ag marketing. And then kind of when it came time to graduate college and go out into the  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:01:43):**  real world, I still felt like I didn't have any real context on choosing a career path.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:01:47):**  And so after spending eight years in the feed and grain business, I started AgGrad, which  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:01:51):**  we specialize in early career recruitment for agribusinesses and ag tech companies.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:01:56):**  It's not obvious to me that having no context would lead to, well, I'll just do it myself.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:02:00):**  So like, how did that decision come about to actually start your own business?  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:02:04):**  Yeah, I guess I kind of skipped eight years in there that I spent, I worked for a company  
**[0:02:08-0:02:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:02:08):**  called DeBruce Grain, which was bought by Gavilon, which was bought by Marabini and  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:02:11):**  kind of a private equity flip. And so I found myself in the situation where because of all  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:02:16):**  of that sort of merger and acquisition activity, a lot of the people I knew had spread out  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:02:21):**  into other companies and other feed and grain companies. And I knew I wanted to do something  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:02:25):**  on my own, but I didn't know what it was. And I thought that was kind of something that  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:02:28):**  I had that not a lot of people had, which was relationships spread throughout the industry.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:02:32):**  And I kind of leveraged that to start a real traditional recruiting company.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:02:36):**  You may be familiar with what Tim means by the traditional recruiting model. But just  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:02:41):**  in case, I asked him to explain what he means and what has changed for him and for his business,  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:02:46):**  AgGrad.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:02:47):**  The title is, companies have only so many resources to go out and constantly be searching  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:02:52):**  for the right people. And it can get really time intensive, especially if you're only  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:02:56):**  doing it when you have an opening and be very demanding and very expensive. And so they  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:03:00):**  hire someone like myself who is willing to do it on a contingency basis to go out and  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:03:04):**  find that person. And contingency basis meaning they pay nothing unless they hire a person  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:03:09):**  I bring to them, in which case I would collect a fee. That's traditionally how it's been  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:03:13):**  done. Even these days, despite the internet and LinkedIn and social media, there still  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:03:17):**  is quite a demand for people who can find talent because it's not such a natural thing  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:03:22):**  to develop these types of relationships and constantly be asking people if they're willing  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:03:25):**  to make a change. That's kind of how I started.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:03:28):**  And is it particular roles like just agribusiness, do you cross into, and senior and junior,  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:03:33):**  like how do you kind of divide up where your specialty is? Or is it generally just across  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:03:37):**  agriculture and agribusiness?  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:03:39):**  That's a great question. When I started, I knew I needed to differentiate myself. And  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:03:43):**  as you can imagine, because the fee is a percentage of salary, most people want the senior roles.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:03:49):**  They consider themselves executive recruiters, they target director level VPs and C suite.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:03:55):**  And so I thought, as I looked around to the competitive landscape, it would seem like  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:03:59):**  there weren't a lot of people my age trying to dive into this space. And so I thought  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:04:03):**  maybe I would specialize in early career recruitment. So from graduating college to maybe seven  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:04:08):**  years in, and my client base when I started was kind of these feeding grain contexts that  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:04:12):**  I had from my previous experience. But I launched a podcast when I started my business, and  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:04:17):**  I was most interested with a podcast in ag innovation. So I started talking to investors  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:04:22):**  and startup founders and people kind of more on the ag tech side and started kind of growing  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:04:26):**  my recruiting practice in that space, in the ag tech space as a result of some of the work  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:04:31):**  I was doing on the podcast.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:04:32):**  And tell me how different that is. Is it a different, like maybe the people are younger,  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:04:36):**  but are there different skills they require? Is it easier or harder to recruit for them?  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:04:39):**  Are there more or less jobs? Like how does that space compare to more traditional agribusiness?  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:04:44):**  It's reflective of kind of what we're seeing in ag tech right now in general, which is  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:04:48):**  customer adoption is a huge challenge. And so my role generally speaking, is with companies  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:04:54):**  that say we have this great product, we have proven this can make farmers more efficient  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:04:58):**  in whatever way, but we really need talent to help grow customer adoption and customer  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:05:03):**  success. And so the roles I'm recruiting for on the tech side generally are either in sales  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:05:08):**  or business development or marketing or in customer success or sales support in that  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:05:12):**  capacity.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:05:13):**  That's a little bit different than the traditional roles in which I'm recruiting for, you know,  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:05:16):**  female managers or grain operations managers or grain merchandisers just requiring a little  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:05:20):**  bit of a different skill set. I wouldn't say they they're always younger cause there's  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:05:24):**  plenty of people more senior in their career that are fascinated and interested in this  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:05:27):**  ag tech space, but it certainly has to be the type of person who's open to new ideas  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:05:31):**  and can take a complex idea and make it simple.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:05:35):**  One of the things that we see in more traditional tech is that the sales process and sales cycle  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:05:40):**  is really different and the skills you would need to do things like, you know, have a digital  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:05:44):**  funnel and all this content marketing and then a more of an inside sales team where  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:05:48):**  people kind of calling and setting up meetings before you'd go out versus kind of more traditional  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:05:52):**  agriculture which would be out in the field, driving up driveways is the ag tech space  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:05:57):**  somewhere in between and imagine the skills that you would need sit in between those two  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:06:01):**  things and that could be hard to find.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:06:04):**  Generally speaking, ag tech companies are trying to find where that balance is because  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:06:07):**  you hit the nail on the head. It does fit somewhere in between, especially if you're  
**[0:06:10-0:06:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:06:10):**  selling to farmers, which most ag tech is. The software model of hiring a bunch of business  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:06:17):**  development reps and sitting down in a call center and having them pound the phones, that  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:06:20):**  can only get you so far. It can only call a farmer so many times when he or she is busy  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:06:25):**  and them tell you not to ever call again. And so I do think we are searching for that  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:06:29):**  hybrid model, you know, where a company might have a business development rep because you  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:06:33):**  have to start somewhere and you have to kind of establish leads in some capacity, but also  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:06:36):**  coupling that with some, some more modern marketing strategies. And I do see quite a  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:06:40):**  bit of success among ag tech companies with developing leads through platforms like Twitter  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:06:45):**  and really getting their word out there digitally and trying to capture some of that early adopter  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:06:49):**  type of grower where the challenge comes in is how do you transition from the early adopter  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:06:53):**  grower that's on Twitter, that's really trying to look going to the events and trying to  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:06:57):**  find the cutting edge to the more mainstream. The other, let's call them 93% of growers  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:07:02):**  that you really need to hit. And I think that's where you need to go a much more traditional.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:07:06):**  Yeah, interesting. But I mean, it's such a common topic and what we've been digging into  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:07:09):**  in the kind of getting ag tech ready theme of different buying patterns. And I found  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:07:13):**  it fascinating that growers on that really early innovator adopter scale would be looking  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:07:18):**  internationally in different places, like totally kind of thinking laterally versus  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:07:23):**  someone else who's looking over the fence nearby. And it's a really different sale,  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:07:26):**  a really different skillset that you would need to sell them products and almost a different  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:07:30):**  person in the company. And that's really tough for hiring talent and training a team.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:07:35):**  Are you seeing much success with, for lack of a better term, and we're both going to  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:07:38):**  cringe when I say this, but kind of influencer marketing, it does seem like there are some  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:07:43):**  progressive farmers out there that other farmers spend a lot of time understanding what they're  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:07:47):**  doing and how, and that would seem to be a good way to tip the scales. But I don't know,  
**[0:07:50-0:07:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:07:50):**  are you seeing that much?  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:07:51):**  It's funny cause I think everyone would cringe at that word and especially the influencers  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:07:54):**  don't think of themselves like that and yet would have so much pride about the influence  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:07:59):**  that they have. So it's a digital marketing language challenge. But yes, they have pride  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:08:05):**  in the fact that they are the first one to adopt something that they found it somewhere  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:08:08):**  else and they want to tell everyone and help everyone else kind of get on board with this.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:08:11):**  And it also depends too in different commodities, like if it's more competitive or not, depending  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:08:17):**  on what type of crop you produce or where. So that would change things. The other kind  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:08:22):**  of influencer I guess we're seeing is more of the traditional like social media influencer,  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:08:27):**  someone who is actually like generating tons of content, often videos about this space  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:08:32):**  and that that hasn't been tapped into at all from the ag tech companies. And I find that  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:08:36):**  fascinating cause it's one of the first places I might go.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:08:38):**  I think we're going to continue to have this conversation a lot over the next few years  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:08:42):**  of we've got some of these more progressively minded, probably the type of growers that  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:08:45):**  are listening to this podcast. I say growers, but I mean that to encompass, you know, farmers  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:08:49):**  and ranchers, but how do we sort of replicate that among the vast majority of producers  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:08:54):**  out there? Yeah, exactly. So how does that change for  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:08:57):**  you as a recruiter thinking about these different skills that people will need in these ag tech  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:09:02):**  companies? Does it require a different business model or a different approach from you?  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:09:06):**  It requires a much more consultative sales mentality rather than just transaction. If  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:09:11):**  you're selling fertilizer or selling chemical, you can kind of go, you know, beat the bushes,  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:09:15):**  so to speak, until you get the sales you need. In this case, you have to be a whole lot more  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:09:20):**  of a teacher, I would say a lot more of a consultant in terms of your mindset because  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:09:24):**  you really have to take sort of a partnership role with the customers you serve.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:09:29):**  And for you recruiting these people, do they come from the same places? Do they have those  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:09:33):**  skills? Do you have to help them develop those skills or is it kind of just shifting to find  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:09:37):**  those people and it's all the same model or do you need a different model to actually  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:09:40):**  like help them be able to have those capabilities? What I have realized is there's plenty of  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:09:45):**  talent out there. There's plenty of talented people that are interested in agriculture  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:09:48):**  and certainly interested in ag tech. Where there is a shortage is not so much in the  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:09:54):**  talent that wants to be in the space, but in the background and skills it takes to be  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:09:58):**  in this space. And so through that, these have been challenging roles to recruit from  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:10:01):**  because you're looking for empathy and that someone who really understands the customer  
**[0:10:06-0:10:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:10:06):**  and has proven they understand the customer, but you're also looking for drive. So like  
**[0:10:09-0:10:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:10:09):**  somebody who doesn't just want to visit, somebody who really wants to see these producers improve  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:10:16):**  and is willing to do whatever it takes to make their customer successful. And so those  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:10:20):**  two things are a bit of a challenge, especially if in empathy you mean experience in understanding  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:10:26):**  a farmer customer because I think the game is shifting a little bit. And so how we're  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:10:30):**  addressing that at AgGrad is we're actually exploring the possibility of offering some  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:10:36):**  job related online training. What we've discovered is in addition to having sort of the skills  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:10:40):**  shortage also what we're seeing is a shortage of opportunities to break in. Most employers  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:10:46):**  will tell you that their best employees, their best recruitment strategy is internships,  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:10:51):**  which I totally understand and agree with, but internships are also extremely limited.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:10:55):**  I mean, usually they're limited at least in the US to juniors and seniors in college.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:10:59):**  They're limited to certain locations. I was a location manager for a grain facility in  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:11:03):**  Binkleman, Nebraska. We were not going to transition an intern out to Southwest Nebraska,  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:11:08):**  middle of nowhere for the summer, pay for their lodging, pay for them, and then pay  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:11:11):**  for them to go back home. It just wasn't in the cards. And so we're looking at how can  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:11:15):**  we replicate the internship model online through training so we can start to develop this type  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:11:19):**  of skill set we're talking about. So how do you do that? Like, is it online courses? Is  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:11:22):**  it webinars? Is it, do they kind of enroll and do you have experts in sales come teach  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:11:27):**  them? Yeah. So our first concern is a lot of these skills, you just have to do them.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:11:31):**  You can't really teach, let's say tractor driving online unless you have a really cool  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:11:35):**  kind of simulator. It's not going to be very effective, but there are a lot of skills that  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:11:38):**  can be taught through a traditional online course. The way that looks is no, you can  
**[0:11:42-0:11:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:11:42):**  call an online course, you can call an internship. We're so early in the exploratory phase here.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:11:45):**  I don't know that we really know what we're calling it for sure, but it would be sponsored  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:11:49):**  by the employer where they say, here are the objectives we like to see met from an intern.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:11:54):**  So we'd like them to learn X, Y, and Z, and we like them to experience, you know, a, B,  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:11:58):**  and C, as far as experiencing our company culture and experiencing the job. And then  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:12:02):**  we say, okay, how best can we replicate that with, with online training combination of  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:12:06):**  video, text and assessments and put together, let's say a, you know, a 10 to 15 hour course  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:12:12):**  where someone interested in a job that has no background can hop on, take that course.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:12:17):**  And then that data is actually shared with real employers. So you can sort of replicate  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:12:20):**  that experience without all of the limitations that come with traditional internship programs.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:12:25):**  That is so cool. I'm really excited to see how it goes. I wanted to hit on the point  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:12:28):**  you said about technology enabled training. So there's a whole conversation around like,  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:12:33):**  can we have virtual reality and use that to train people to shear sheep or milk cows?  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:12:39):**  Do you think that's real? And do you think there's other kind of technology enabled ways  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:12:43):**  to train people that might get more towards like a tractor simulator or something like  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:12:47):**  that?  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:12:48):**  From what I know, I think that's very possible in the future. What I'm understanding about  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:12:52):**  the current state of virtual reality and augmented reality is that they are far enough along  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:12:56):**  to prove that it's possible, but, but still maybe have a long way to go to actually implementing  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:13:01):**  to that degree in terms of sharing sheep or driving a tractor or fixing an implement or  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:13:06):**  something like that. Conceptually, I don't think we're really that far off. I could see  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:13:09):**  it happening in the future and perhaps, you know, it could be a direction that we can  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:13:13):**  take some of this, this online training. If we can really develop the core competency  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:13:16):**  of the education component and improve results from, from what we're presenting, I think  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:13:21):**  that could be an exciting frontier for us and for others who want to do the same thing  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:13:24):**  because yeah, I mean, one of the limitation agriculture is geography. We can't up and  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:13:28):**  move your farm somewhere else for, you know, for the convenience of your employees. Right?  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:13:33):**  So how best can we utilize the internet to exchange knowledge? Cause so much we talk  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:13:37):**  about technology being a thing and being a product, but you know, really it's, it's the  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:13:40):**  implementation of knowledge. And if you don't have that knowledge in your employees or your  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:13:44):**  future employees, then no amount of new equipment is going to help.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:13:47):**  Exactly. It couldn't be more in line with stuff we talk about that you actually need  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:13:50):**  the foundations first and then the technology can help it. It's not a silver bullet solution  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:13:54):**  in itself. I wanted to ask about the perceptions of ag tech jobs and I've seen a bit of hesitation.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:14:01):**  Like yes, there's a lot of people who are really keen to get into this space old or  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:14:04):**  young and really see the potential of it. Want to have an impact, want to bring a different  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:14:07):**  skill set in, but there's also maybe some challenges around, no, just go get a job at  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:14:12):**  a bank or go get a job at a large agribusiness corporate and don't worry about this ag tech  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:14:17):**  stuff. It's a bit silly. Are you seeing any kind of social pressure to either get in or  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:14:21):**  out of ag tech? Yeah, I am. And I think one downside to a  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:14:25):**  word that likes to get thrown around him is companies that label themselves as disruptors  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:14:28):**  who, you know, vocally claim we're going to come out to the ag industry and turn everything  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:14:34):**  on its head. You know, some people get really excited by that. I think it's a little bit  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:14:37):**  harder to motivate some of the traditional ag employees to that bent, but taking it more  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:14:43):**  generally to ag tech, I haven't seen lately. I think maybe when I first started recruiting,  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:14:48):**  which would have been back in 2015, I saw some of that sort of like, well, I don't know.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:14:52):**  I, you know, I kind of want to just work for the co-op and I don't know if it's what the  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:14:56):**  farm economy has done in recent years or what the reason is, but it seems like maybe there's  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:15:01):**  more interest in ag tech in general or, or maybe it's just, we're seeing maybe some more  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:15:05):**  of the benefits. So I'm starting to see generally more willingness to explore ag tech as a career  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:15:11):**  option for cultural, traditional agricultural folks where there still is maybe that line  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:15:15):**  in the sand of, I don't know that I want to be a part of that is sort of like, you know,  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:15:19):**  do I really want to be a disruptor because maybe not everybody thinks that this industry  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:15:23):**  needs to be totally disrupted or can be in the way that's being touted.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:15:26):**  Totally. Yeah, I agree with that. So while I have you, Tim, I want to do some maybe rapid  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:15:31):**  fire advice and tips for people both on the hiring side and the job searching side. So  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:15:37):**  any common mistakes that people looking to recruit in this space would make, so your  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:15:41):**  clients and trying to hire, like what's something that they kind of do wrong that you have to  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:15:46):**  coach them or help them to not do because it's just not going to set them up for success.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:15:51):**  Being transactional is the biggest mistake. So posting a job, having a defined close,  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:15:55):**  taking what you have and hiring one. It would be great if the world could work that way,  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:15:59):**  but if you really care about getting the right people, it's, it's extremely important that  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:16:03):**  you're constantly, constantly cultivating these types of relationships. I'm sure you've  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:16:06):**  talked about in this podcast before, kind of like raising money and you know, investment  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:16:09):**  and how a lot of the advice is, you know, you kind of always need to be cultivating  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:16:12):**  those relationships because as much as you want to raise a series a and 90 days, it might  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:16:16):**  be tough. And I look at hiring talent the same way for everybody, for a farm that hires  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:16:21):**  maybe one person every five years, all the way up to a company that hires 50 people a  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:16:25):**  year. You've got to constantly be cultivating these relationships. And with the internet,  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:16:29):**  you can do that at scale, be it through social media, be it through content or just be it  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:16:35):**  through individually reaching out to people on a place like LinkedIn. But establishing  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:16:39):**  those relationships are going to be pivotal in the making sure that when you do have the  
**[0:16:43-0:16:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:16:43):**  need, you can find the right person.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:16:45):**  It used to be that you could only establish relationships in person. And while that may  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:16:49):**  still be the best way, we have so many digital tools that can help us connect. Companies  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:16:55):**  are using these tools too. My other half, David is a good example, as much as I hate  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:17:00):**  to admit it. Over the last few months, he's been making videos, selfie videos, to celebrate  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:17:06):**  his employees and show off the culture of where he works. Though I find the videos to  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:17:11):**  be well cringe worthy, they're actually pretty effective. Future hires can get a sense of  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:17:17):**  what it's like to be on his team and what it's like to work for him before they even  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:17:21):**  apply. Tim says that companies need to invest in this kind of thing, demonstrating their  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:17:27):**  culture, having a personality, especially if they want to attract young people.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:17:32):**  People who are our age and younger, they don't want to look at their career as one-dimensionally  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:17:37):**  as a salary. They want to look at it as a fit, a place that they want to feel like they  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:17:42):**  can be themselves and contribute and they want to fit the culture. And they don't know  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:17:46):**  the culture from your job posting, and they're not going to take your word for it in an interview.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:17:50):**  They want a chance to get to know you outside of that.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:17:53):**  Such a good tip for employers. So how about a mistake that someone makes in trying to  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:17:56):**  get a job? So on the other side, what's a common mistake?  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:18:00):**  The biggest mistake, and maybe I'm saying it as the biggest because it's happened to  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:18:04):**  me too many times lately, is if you get to an interview with a company, they are probably  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:18:09):**  already past the fact that you are qualified on paper. What they are assessing are two  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:18:14):**  things primarily. Number one, are you a cultural fit? Are you going to fit their team? Does  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:18:19):**  what you want in a role fit what they want in a role? And secondly, they want to know,  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:18:23):**  are you serious? It's so easy to apply for a job right now that they really need to find  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:18:29):**  out, are you serious? Otherwise they're just kind of wasting their time with you and they're  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:18:33):**  going to go through an offer stage and you're going to be flattered and you're going to  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:18:35):**  say no because you want to stick with your current employer.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:18:38):**  So the biggest mistake people make is they don't make it clear that they're very serious  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:18:41):**  and they want the job. I have had multiple people in the last month get to the final  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:18:46):**  offer stage and not get an offer because they went with the other candidate who just seemed  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:18:50):**  more on fire for the job. So it's like the simplest thing ever, which is why I get passionate  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:18:55):**  about it because it's so easy that everyone should be doing it. It shouldn't be a mistake,  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:18:59):**  but make sure you show genuine interest. If you're to that point, that's what they're  
**[0:19:03-0:19:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:19:03):**  looking for.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:19:04):**  It's so true. Couldn't agree more. And last question, what advice would you have for someone  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:19:08):**  who is trying to get into ag tech and is maybe worried about the skills that they have or  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:19:13):**  don't have?  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:19:14):**  I think you used the term earlier. There's no magic bullet and it's the same thing for  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:19:17):**  getting a job. So it's the oldest trick in the book, which is networking and building  
**[0:19:21-0:19:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:19:21):**  relationships. It should be easier than ever to build relationships with the tools we have  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:19:25):**  at hand. You know, use LinkedIn, you use Twitter. If you send a personalized invite in agriculture  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:19:31):**  with a compelling reason as why you'd like to connect with them, almost everybody in  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:19:35):**  this industry will connect with you. If you engage with somebody on Twitter and you see  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:19:39):**  that they're at least active, almost everybody in this industry will interact with you. Don't  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:19:42):**  come in with an ask, come in with genuine conversation and exchange of value. Everybody's  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:19:48):**  going to be a little bit different about how they can handle that depending on kind of  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:19:51):**  what you have to provide, but definitely just reach out old school networking and provide  
**[0:19:55-0:19:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:19:55):**  value.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:19:57):**  That's for sure my advice as well. The add value and the other one would be, well, there's  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:20:02):**  like follow up as well, which is common advice, but I love what you kind of hit on around  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:20:05):**  content and that you can build a brand and build these relationships online, whether  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:20:09):**  that's through the insightful or funny tweets that you post or a blog that you have or what  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:20:13):**  you're saying on LinkedIn. You can actually do that as you said before at scale as well  
**[0:20:17-0:20:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:20:17):**  in a way that you couldn't do previously.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:20:19):**  Right. And I mean, it could be as simple as sharing content. You read an article that  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:20:23):**  gets set you on fire about ag tech, you know, share it with a little bit of commentary,  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:20:27):**  tag people in the comments asking for their input. You know, I mean there's, there's really  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:20:31):**  natural ways to, to engage with people and don't feel like you'll be one of millions  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:20:35):**  that are doing that because the truth is very few people are doing that.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:20:39):**  Especially in agriculture, I would say awesome, Tim. Well, thank you so much for joining me  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:20:42):**  on the podcast. Some super helpful tips for many people here, and I'm really excited to  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:20:46):**  hear about the future of ag grad and the useful skill development that you'll be doing there.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=431525#t=0:20:51):**  Thanks so much, Sarah. It's been a lot of fun.

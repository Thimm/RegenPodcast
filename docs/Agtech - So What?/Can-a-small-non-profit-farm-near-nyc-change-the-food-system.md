### Agtech - So What?  (2021-01-24)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by The Agthentic Group.  I'm your host, Sarah Nolette.  Today we're exploring whether and how a small nonprofit farm just north of New York City  can change how agriculture is done across the US.  If you caught our last episode, you'll know that sustainability science professor and  
**[0:00:21-0:00:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:00:21):**  author Rob Paulburg would say no.  That while local organic farms are an important part of the food system, that to really move  the needle on sustainability, we need farming practices that can be deployed at scale.  But our guest today disagrees.  I think there has to be room for ecologically minded or thoughtfully minded agriculture.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:00:40):**  And I think that the largest players in the world are recognizing that too.  And it's not like you can just continue farming without considering the ecology.  So I think it's just a matter of when that conversation comes up.  Some people are there now, some people were already there, and some people will come to  it in the future.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:00:59):**  That's Jason Grauer.  He's the crops director at the Stone Barn Center for Food and Agriculture, a beautiful  farming property in the Hudson Valley of New York that incorporates regenerative and organic  practices and has its own education center.  So a farm right near New York City, how is that even financially possible, you might  
**[0:01:15-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:01:15):**  be thinking?  Well, back in the 1930s, it was a dairy, but its modern conception officially began in  2003 by none other than the Rockefeller family.  It was an experiment in sustainable farming and innovation, part of a vision to create  a place to connect with the land and with farmers to inspire people to grow and eat  
**[0:01:32-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:01:32):**  sustainable food.  Since then, Stone Barns has attracted people from all walks of life, like Jason, who started  his career as a banker.  We'll get to why Jason thinks places like Stone Barns are vital to the future of agriculture  in a moment.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:01:45):**  But first, it's worth hearing how he went from baking to farming.  It's very much a lesson in what you might do if you're stuck in a job that you hate.  When I graduated, I graduated with an economics degree, and I was thinking about what I wanted  to be involved with, but I didn't have necessarily the path all figured out.  And the first thing that became interesting was the financial crisis and how that tied  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:02:12):**  so closely to the economics degree I had.  So I was pushing my way into the burning building, essentially, while the economy was collapsing.  So it was a difficult time to get a job or to have a direct path to get a job.  So I was kind of reaching out to everybody on all sides and really found the hedge fund  world the most interesting because of all the flexibility and possibility that it had  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:02:36):**  there.  And so I ended up in an asset management job.  And so that was kind of the beginning of the career to learn to take this knowledge of  economics and try to apply it in the real world and see how things unfolded.  And so you're doing your hedge fund job, and did you love it at first and then start to  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:02:55):**  not like it?  And that's how farming came in or what happened?  Yes.  So I was ready to run through walls.  I just wanted to learn as much as possible.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:03:05):**  So again, everything was crumbling, so everything was interesting.  So this whole thing, like kind of uncovering how the economic system works, how these investments  work, because they weren't working.  So it was kind of like this amazing opportunity to see what it was that made the system crack  or what was that made these bubbles happen or these bubbles finally burst.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:03:25):**  So I was all in, super excited.  And when I got in, I just honestly feel like the people I was surrounded with weren't as  excited as I was about learning.  Weren't as excited about sharing.  And it just seemed kind of like a lot of people who were just working a job.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:03:45):**  And so even though I had this excitement about learning about economics and trying to make  some money and figure out how to do it all, it was really like pulling teeth to try to  get people to stay later than 5 o'clock.  And in the investment banking world, that's a pretty common thing.  But in the asset management world, it's all about relationships and sales.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:04:04):**  And it's a different kind of game.  And it just became, yeah, it really started to numb me to the point that I could not handle  it anymore.  And so how did you find a farm?  Was that a weekend therapy or like you were looking for a different food or like how did  
**[0:04:20-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:04:20):**  those dots connect?  Yeah, for sure.  I think you nailed it when you said weekend therapy.  The only thing is I didn't know what that therapy was going to be.  So farming, the beautiful thing about farming is it started out as a total accident and  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:04:32):**  became my life.  So to trace it back, so I'm working for some people that weren't necessarily passionate  and in love with their jobs.  And so this started to eat away at me.  And I really was just trying to look at career more than anything, career, lifestyle.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:04:48):**  What is it that makes people happy or what does it make people passionate about their  jobs?  As an athlete, I knew how to be passionate about the sport I was playing.  And it was something I just wanted to relive that kind of magic about being all in and  loving something and giving yourself completely to something with a team of people.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:05:07):**  And so I didn't think, I mean, where I grew up, I grew up in New York City, the suburbs,  like nothing rural.  And so this idea of farming was never even a possibility in my world.  So I started to explore a lot of different things.  So as I was becoming way more disinterested in my job, I started to try to meet as many  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:05:27):**  people as I possibly could that love their job or were doing things that were really  interesting and amazing.  I mean, I was meeting chefs, I was meeting artists, I was meeting writers, literally  anything.  So the first step wasn't like find a farmer.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:05:41):**  It wasn't like, hey, this thing could be exciting to me.  The first step was just like, who does love their job?  Where do the interesting things that I love come from and who's working on them?  And how does it all work?  So it was about meeting people, stumbling into things, you know, interrupting people's  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:05:56):**  dinners.  I remember this one guy who was this economic writer, Todd Harrison, who became a big influence  in my life.  He was writing about investments and he had been running a hedge fund for years and starting  to educate people on how that system worked to make people better investors.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:06:14):**  And I remember just like seeing him at a dinner and just being in this place in life where  it was like, there's no reason to hold back.  So I just walked right up to him in the middle of a date he was on and actually interrupted  the date to praise him and to say how much I appreciated his writing and his candor and  all this.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:06:31):**  Gave him my card and a couple days later, he actually emailed me back or just wrote  to me out of the blue, which I wasn't expecting.  And just said he actually thanked me so much for making him look so good on this date.  Other than helping someone look good on date, that experience gave Jason the confidence  to keep taking chances and connecting with new people.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:06:51):**  And that's exactly how he found Farming.  So there's a key person in the story for me is my best friend who was also working in  the finance industry.  And so we were meeting up regularly.  And one of the things that he came across during 2008 was that farmland was a really  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:07:08):**  interesting investment opportunity.  So I was like, yeah, I'll go check out anything.  We're talking to chefs and entrepreneurs and let's talk to farmers.  Sure, that sounds good.  But I had no interest in farming or so I thought.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:07:23):**  So we meet up one day to the whole idea was just go directly to the stores.  So if you think farming is interesting, you should go directly to the farmers.  If you want to learn about land management.  So we woke up early one day, went to a farmer's market and just by sheer luck, and it's such  an amazing thing to kind of reflect back on is really early going to this farmer's market,  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:07:44):**  which back then was something I don't think I've ever done in my life.  The farmer's market was closed for the season.  And so he rerouted us because he's like, well, I know this one other place.  And we were in Connecticut at the time.  And he said, I know this one other place, this farm and education center that also has  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:08:01):**  this incredible restaurant.  And it's a place that is connected to some public land and people walk around and it's  called the Stonebarn Center.  So we shifted from going to the farmer's market where nobody was to going to this farm and  education center.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:08:16):**  And that was the first moment I ever set foot on a farm in any real capacity of awareness  outside of like being five years old, kindergarten, getting driven to like a pumpkin patch where  you don't even know how those pumpkins got into the middle of a big lawn because you  don't see any plants and it's pretty much just grass.  So that moment, the juxtaposition of those two moments were very special to me.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:08:44):**  So we came to this farm and so that day in particular was snowing.  So we drive over there in the middle of a snowstorm and see a group on a tour.  And we just figured, okay, there's probably some people that can answer some questions  or getting their questions answered.  So we kind of like slowly moved to the back of the line and we see that everybody has  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:09:06):**  these stickers on, but we're not thinking too much about it.  But later we found out that everyone was paying to be on this tour that we just kind of snuck  into the back of.  And it was a really, you know, one of those magical moments where you think in your life  only in retrospect can you realize how important those decisions were.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:09:24):**  But here we are two city kids on this farm on this tour and we're listening to the guy  giving the tour in the snow and it's pretty fascinating what he's saying.  So we're kind of like slowly creeping up to get closer to the guy.  There's probably like 25 people on the tour trying to get closer, maybe raise our hands  and ask questions.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:09:43):**  We notice that he notices us and we kind of, we're kind of thinking, okay, notices that  we don't have the stickers, but we don't think much about it.  Ask some questions.  The guy's like an incredible speaker.  So the tour ends, we get this full tour of the farm, the tour ends and we go right up  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:09:56):**  to the guy and start talking to him.  And this was the moment that changed everything.  It turned out that on this snowy November, Saturday, we snuck onto a tour with the farm's  director.  And his name is Jack.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:10:12):**  And Jack's been farming his entire life and he's running the farm at the Stone Barn Center.  So we ended up speaking to him not just for a minute, but we speak to him for a couple  of hours that day.  And he presents us with an option that he's like, well, you guys have so many questions  and you're so interested.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:10:27):**  Why don't you just come volunteer here?  And I didn't even know what he was talking about because I thought volunteering was something  you could only do at like soup kitchens or, you know, for charity.  Like I didn't know you could just volunteer at people's jobs.  So to shorten that story, I mean, that was this incredible inflection moment in my life  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:10:46):**  where we had just met someone who was super inspiring, who is there on a weekend working  and giving a tour and not even blinking an eye of the fact that the weather sucks.  And so we said we'd come back and volunteer.  So after that day, when I went back to my job, when I went back to the office in my  suit and sat at my desk in my cubicle and saw everybody come in exactly at nine and  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:11:11):**  leave exactly at five and all the same hamster wheel moving and moving, I just became addicted  to the fact that there was somebody who loved their job and I wanted to learn more.  Pretty soon, Jason had the ag bug.  At work, he found himself looking up seed profiles and researching vegetables instead  of investments.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:11:29):**  To him, farming opened up a whole world of opportunities.  And I really feel like working in food and agriculture is a passport to the entire world  because everywhere you go, agriculture exists and everywhere that there are people, there's  culture tied to agriculture.  And so anything you can do in the food industry will, if you trace it back to agriculture,  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:11:50):**  you can have a connecting point with people.  So that became another huge, addicting part about agriculture was that it felt like I  could connect with anybody in the world in a way that I had never done before.  Just being in kind of the little circle and bubble that I was living in.  But Stone Barns is a nonprofit farm and education center in the Hudson Valley in New York.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:12:12):**  And the mission is a lofty one.  It's to change the food system.  Broadly speaking, it's to change the food system and to establish an ecological food  culture.  And I think those words are really well put together because it's a really lofty goal  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:12:28):**  that ties to that idea of setting goals bigger than you can probably achieve in your lifetime,  that kind of thing.  So we're talking about a full system shift.  And so here there's a partnership with an incredible restaurant, Blue Hill, that's handling  the culinary side of understanding agriculture.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:12:45):**  And there's the nonprofit itself, the farm that is running multiple farming systems at  the same time to show how diversified agriculture or what's being called regenerative agriculture  or these ideas of rotational systems, systems that are feeding and replacing the nutrients  that get extracted.  That's the type of agriculture that's happening here.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:13:09):**  And so what once started as only an 80 acre farm has now expanded into a 400 acre farm  that is managing not just private farmland, but also the conservation of what is New York's  most heavily trafficked state preserve.  And that's the Rockefeller State Preserve.  So to give you a kind of visually, there's 1500 acres.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:13:32):**  That's the Rockefeller State Preserve.  And inside that 1500 acres is 400 acres.  That's not totally connected.  That makes up the Stone Barn Center.  So there are pastures and meadows and forests all throughout that 1500 acres that are part  
**[0:13:46-0:13:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:13:46):**  of the quote unquote farm, as well as the main center farm that is a center that has  a conference center, a restaurant, large open spaces and courtyards and educational facilities  for people to come in and to engage.  And fast forwarding, now you do have a job there now, but there was a few things along  the way.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:14:08):**  So tell us what you're up to today.  Now I'm the crops director and I'm managing the vegetable production, grain production,  flour and herbs on about a little more than 10 acres.  And within that, my focal point is seed research or genetics as a whole.  So we do a lot of seed variety trials, a little bit of seed breeding, and we're connecting  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:14:38):**  the dots.  So my job is to really connect the dots with all these seed breeders and all the seed savers  and seed companies, universities, extension agents, everyone that's out there working  on genetics for these regenerative systems and running those trials here on the farm.  One of the pushbacks or questions around some of what you're saying, I guess might be that  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:15:03):**  a place like Stone Barns that has philanthropic capital coming in and has access to land and  volunteers and things like that, is that really representative of the food system?  And I guess when you guys think about systems change and transforming the food system, knowing  that the Stone Barns isn't necessarily what other farms look like or how they're funded  or things like that, how do you guys think about that kind of theory of change and especially  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:15:27):**  the pushback of, you know, we're trying to feed the world and so scale is important or  volume is important or specialization in certain crops and that leads to monocropping.  I guess how do you guys think about the work you do in terms of having an impact on the  food system and driving that change?  That is, there are so many good points you just brought up in there.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:15:47):**  And I think those are amazing questions to ask because I think the answer is that for  a while, you know, the first iteration was for Stone Barns, like show that the farm is  economically viable, right?  Just show that this market garden, and I mean, it's not just that I speak just to vegetables,  but there's an entire livestock operation and there is an entire landscape team, an  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:16:10):**  agroforestry team really working to preserve the ecology of this entire system.  And I would say that the reason why a place like Stone Barns is important and justifiable  is that if we try to stick a farm into the economic system right away, in all its possibility,  it doesn't work because there's so many different enterprises that need to be accounted for.  So I mean, Stone Barns as a nonprofit, in many ways has a responsibility to not get  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:16:41):**  in the way of the current farming community, right?  And not to say it would get in the way, but that like to give that idea, like, it's not  to get in the way, it's to try to help facilitate and take actions that may not actually be  taking place in the current farming landscape, right?  Because we can live in a certain structure where it's like, this is the reality that  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:17:03):**  exists and that is it, right?  And so it's like, and we can all like fall back on them and be like, oh yeah, this is  how it's always been and this is how it's going to be like, oh, food's too expensive  and food should be grown like this and the cost of food should be this.  And everyone can fall back and rest on their laurels and think back to what they know because  
**[0:17:21-0:17:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:17:21):**  they were born into it.  Or we could be exploring what else is possible.  And I think that is the importance of university land grant universities.  And it's the importance of nonprofit organizations that can take a step in a direction that doesn't  have to be strangled by the economic system as it is.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:17:39):**  Like what happens in most businesses?  Well, how do we scale this?  And what happens in most businesses is like, how do we think profit first?  Or how do we think investment first?  And then we can figure out the idea.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:17:51):**  And so to really be grounded as an organization in the ability to really push forward principles  and ideas and do really great interactive work with businesses or business ideas.  And so the idea is to really work with the makers and work with the artisans and work  with the farmers and figure out what those things are.  And I think a very real grounded example is in the work that I do very specifically because  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:18:15):**  I think that's best for me to speak to.  And that's with genetics.  So every good farm has a deep understand.  Every good, let's say vegetable farm has a deep understanding of their genetics.  They're not just putting random seed in the ground.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:18:28):**  They're not going down to a corner store and buying some random seed.  There's thoughtfulness around that, whether that's deep historical generational significance  to those seeds or whether it's their deep relationship with universities as we have  here in the United States or with seed companies.  Whatever the structure is, there's this deep relationship to understanding genetics.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:18:49):**  And now how do we figure out what those genetics are that farms are going to use?  Well, if a farm is just a working business, it's the best farms we know are always pushing  the limits a little bit.  They're testing, they're trialing.  But for a nonprofit like Stone Barns, the capacity we have for that exploration within  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:19:07):**  the actual kind of production knowledge, the actual production system is really, really  valuable because that doesn't totally exist.  So a university would be very much in its research field structure.  So maybe they're testing something out, but they're testing it out with spacing that no  farmer would actually test out.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:19:24):**  And so we can play a role in being able to test genetics, hundreds of varieties that  we can explore, but we put what we say is we put it into the production system.  And so some examples like, you know, we generally will point to an example like the honey nut  squash, which is a squash that was bred out of Cornell University.  And that's a land grant in New York.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:19:48):**  And Stone Barns is a farm in New York.  And Blue Hill is a restaurant in New York.  And so collaborating together with that regional breeding that happened at Cornell University,  testing that thing off, working with the breeder that's polishing it and making it something  that's viable for farms production ready, and bringing it to the Stone Barns organization  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:20:07):**  to have it not only be tested in the fields, but also to be tested in the kitchen, to be  tasted and explored and to help shape the future of those genetics to be really tasty,  really high in nutrition and really good for farmers to grow.  So you need the farmer, you need the chef, you need the breeder all to be in conversation  together.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:20:28):**  So that example, and that may not be a specific genetics that speaks to people all over the  world, but it's really gone from this small thing in a seed lab in Cornell University  to being a mainstay of groceries all throughout the United States.  So that's a really good example of, I think, where it's important.  And it's not to say that another farm couldn't have played that role.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:20:51):**  But it's to say that Stone Barns and its really unique relationship with restaurant and with  our community here in Sharing Story was able to help facilitate the spark for something  that should be out there.  Yeah, you're clearly passionate about it.  And I think that's a really good answer.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:21:07):**  Also the trend that we see a lot and we've actually been talking about on the podcast  is starting from the consumer end.  And if the demand side wants something, then figuring out how to meet that demand, whether  that's connection to source or certain flavors or certain ethics around food production or  scale, that there's an opportunity in meeting that demand.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:21:27):**  And so for you guys, I imagine the connection to chefs and the platform that you guys have  with Stone Barns is a pretty important part of that to really understand what consumers  want and help think about what a food system that responds to that and meets those demands  looks like.  For sure.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:21:44):**  But you know what's funny?  It's like it's also the flip of that.  That like we're at such a point where the knowledge is so rare to find.  Like a lot of chefs at culinary schools, they're not necessarily teaching a farm to table cuisine  or like what to get at the farmer's market.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:21:59):**  And we have been engaging with tons of culinary schools to try or tons of culinary students  to try to engage this learning.  But they're trapped in an economic bind also.  Like restaurants are terrible businesses.  They're very low margin businesses, just like farms.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:22:15):**  So to ask them to spend more on food is a really difficult thing to do.  So where that ties to your point is just this idea that sometimes demand is kind of like  this limited piece, whereas supply, if we could provide a lot of possibility, we're  hoping to shift the demand because right now the demand is not as diverse as let's say  the land is calling for it.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:22:41):**  One of the key areas where Jason says that Stone Barns can make a difference is seed  trials.  He argues that when it comes to ag tech and innovation, seeds, which are the simplest,  but perhaps most important element of farming are often left behind.  Seeds are amazing because seeds are history.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:22:58):**  Their story, their connection to the past, because you can't have a seed without a story.  You just can't because if it exists in this moment, it's tied to something from the past.  And I guess you could say that about a lot of things, but once you get into the importance  of diversity on a farm, when you get out of mono crop systems, when you get into food  for people, you realize that diversity is not just something that's good ecologically.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:23:24):**  I think one of the reasons why seeds became a focal point of like the entrepreneurial  spirit in me is that while seeds are this incredibly valuable tool that every farm is  using, just like everything else, there's been a massive consolidation.  A lot of the most interesting and most delicious small batch things have been left behind just  like there's rarely any great bakeries anymore.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:23:49):**  They're spewing far between.  So seed is something that was definitely left behind by the technological revolution.  So basically all the information is on paper.  It was on paper catalogs until very recently, and it still is in many ways.  And it seems like it's kind of the key because if you get your soil right, if you have your  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:24:08):**  management practices right, if you have a community that's ready for you to farm, you  got to show up for them and part of showing up for them is the seeds that you choose because  that's the flavors, the textures, the colors, the sizes, the shapes, and the resistance  to disease and pests that allow you to be natural in your practices.  Because the only reason we need synthetics is when the system has an imbalance or we  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:24:33):**  have an improper set of genetics for a system.  So it's a really powerful tool.  I think that's what's so exciting about it.  In terms of what you guys are looking at with genetics and breeding, just tell me a little  bit about that.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:24:44):**  Like what are some of the things you're looking to solve for and what's some of the cutting  edge work that you're doing in that space?  Yes.  I think the way to explain it is that we're trying to bring in all the players.  That's how we're observing this research.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:25:00):**  So who are the players?  So you have history, you have seed that's been around.  Let's call it heirloom seed, just for lack of a better term.  So we have seed that's been around and has story tied to it and culture tied to it and  cuisine tied to it.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:25:17):**  So for example, we have this autofillae corn, which is beautiful and is a corn that was  originally from this region, but has gotten, like to give you an example why the seed work  is even important, it's gotten lost and ended up, long story short, it ended up in Italy  being grown by these villages and making polenta with it and found its way back through the  work of these incredible seed historians and seed savers and seed has such amazing and  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:25:42):**  weird and incredibly interesting people tied to it.  And they found that seed and they brought it back to New York and said, you know, this  is where it's from.  So of course we have to grow that.  We have to honor this land and honor the history to grow this corn.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:25:56):**  So that's the oldest type of heirloom concept you could think about, right?  But then it's also about connecting with the seed companies that are feeding the world.  And they're feeding the world through, you know, at the largest scale, it's organic agriculture.  So who's doing organic seed?  And the craziest, most interesting part of the whole thing is that organic seed is a  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:26:16):**  tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of the seed that's available in the world.  So to just make that sum it up is seed is not grown organically or bred for organic  systems, systems that don't use synthetic chemicals.  It just is a very like drop in the bucket for the seed industry.  So we go from this indigenous corn, we go all the way to the other side to global companies  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:26:39):**  that have the highest levels of technology, but the strongest ethic, meaning that they  won't go as far as GMO.  They won't go as far as supporting synthetic chemicals, but they will explore hybridization  and they will explore natural resilience in all of its forms from a scientific perspective.  So that to give you the spectrum, it's that it's the oldest corn to the newest corn, that  
**[0:27:02-0:27:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:27:02):**  kind of thing.  And, and one other piece is there are these university breeders, there's public breeders,  which are such an important part of the American system.  And it's a dying breed, you know, to excuse the phrase, but they are, yeah, there's few  and far between the system used to be flush with plant breeders.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:27:21):**  And now you can go to a university like Cornell or Wisconsin and find the top breeders for,  you know, smaller crops, like not commodities, vegetables.  And each one of these breeders has like six vegetables attached to them.  Like there used to be an onion specialist and a carrot specialist.  And now you'll find that that those two crops, which you could spend a career on, have one  
**[0:27:43-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:27:43):**  public specialist.  Whereas in the private sector, you have singular specialties often because they have more money  and they, you know, they can, they can do those kinds of things.  So we're using all those, we're partnering with all sides of this to try to get the lay  of the land and really explore everything.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:28:00):**  Like we don't have a bias towards heirloom and we don't have a bias towards hybrid.  It's about finding the best seeds for a region that grow the best here and support the farmers  here.  The cool thing is it's not about keeping it here.  It's about getting it out there.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:28:14):**  And the other thing is it's not about a business.  It's about the information and sharing that.  So we're not selling seed, we're just sharing the information.  So how influential can the seed trials at Stone Barns be in changing the food system?  I put this to Jason asking about the challenges that small organic farms will have in producing  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:28:31):**  enough food without needing to clear more land.  That's a very common opinion.  And I think that over the last five decades or longer, that opinion has become more of  an easy out.  Like because the more smaller farms and the more organic farming has faded away, the easier  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:28:51):**  it is to say that it wasn't doing what we needed it to do.  And it's just kind of an easy thing when it's not right in front of you.  But I think what's happening now is like farming is on the rise.  And I think more and more people are having firsthand experiences to realize just how  much food can be produced off of land.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:29:09):**  And I think the relativity of this idea of commercial farming versus organic farming,  I mean, all these things are so relative to what it is you're producing.  You know, it's like the same argument that you have with hydroponic farms claiming that  they can feed the world.  I mean, hydroponic farms are not going to be growing grains or cattle that require so  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:29:27):**  many hundreds or thousands and thousands of acres really to produce food that can feed  any number of people.  So there's a relativity to it, too.  It's like a lot of, you know, how do you want to swing the numbers to support what you're  saying?  
**[0:29:39-0:29:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:29:39):**  I think what's important is to realize that we have data showing the frustration that  the earth seems to be feeling from the monoculture large scale production that needs to be run  in a different way.  And I mean, commercial large scale growers are recognizing this, too.  I mean, compost and other methods that are so second nature to smaller scale and organic  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:30:04):**  farming are being used on larger scale, too, because the amount of waste that's being produced.  I think that argument is a fear based argument that we have to stay just the way we are because  it couldn't be any different and it couldn't be any better if we did it any other way.  While Jason's arguing for a way of farming that draws upon the knowledge of the past,  he's not a big fan of the various terms and labels.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:30:25):**  And he's definitely not suggesting that we go back to the way things were before industrialization.  I think there's a false belief that we're going back to something.  How can you go back to something if things aren't the same?  Things are different.  The way we've treated the land requires different actions.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:30:42):**  I think that's the beauty of the style of agriculture that is, you know, that we call  organic or regenerative.  I mean, all these terms now have so many negative labels to them that can be really difficult  to use.  But I'd say soil based, thoughtful agriculture that uses regenerative practices and uses  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:31:00):**  organic practices.  This form of agriculture, it doesn't exist in a bubble of the past because it's actually  a responsive agriculture.  There's no recipe that we can hand anybody and say, this is how this works.  Even when people talk about number of animals per acre and what animals, I mean, all that  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:31:19):**  is a prescription for the land.  And that's what we talk about is what is your land telling you?  What is the soil telling you?  And I mean, you can think of it spiritually, but you can also be like, what is the soil  test telling you?  
**[0:31:30-0:31:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:31:30):**  What are the levels of phosphorus and nitrogen?  And what is the effect of putting a chicken on that land versus the effect of putting  a grazing animal like a ruminant on that land?  I mean, even their excrement is extremely different.  So it's going to be dependent.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:31:45):**  I think the beauty of this idea of regenerative is it's reactive to space and it uses wisdom  that came way beyond.  It does use wisdom from the past, but technology is going to help us understand it more deeply  here in the future because so much of that wisdom has been lost and so many different  people are doing it now.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:32:03):**  So oh my God, the use of technology is paramount to the success of regenerative agriculture.  I mean, even just to give an example, like I use digital sensors for all of our coolers  and all of our genetic trials to test not just, hey, this thing still tastes good after  a couple of weeks in storage, but here were all the conditions, here were the humidity,  here's what all, you know, that's just one very basic example.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:32:27):**  What we don't want to do is we don't want to get to a place where we think technology  gives us all the answers and we can stop doing the work.  If you're wondering what happened to Jason's business experience, it has been channeled  in another direction.  He's using his knowledge of plant breeding and the seed industry to create a seed database  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:32:44):**  called Pick a Carrot, a new venture that brings hospitality and regen ag together.  And that's just one of two new ventures that Jason's working on.  Now it feels like second nature to call myself a farmer, but in the beginning it was really  difficult to jump careers and just be like, I'm a farmer.  I felt like a fake for so long and I still have so much more to learn, but the idea was  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:33:04):**  it was hard to think that farming was going to be my career, but I loved it, but I just  didn't think it was practical.  But then after a while I realized that that practicality didn't really matter.  It was about following the passion.  And so at the beginning I was really trying to figure out a way to marry the two worlds  
**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:33:20):**  that are, that were defining me.  So it was this business or entrepreneurial side that I always felt I was and this new  identity related to agriculture.  So all these businesses that I've been a part of have stemmed from that.  And so, yeah, these are private businesses that I, that I'm involved with that either  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:33:38):**  started or I'm advising on separate from my work at Snowmarns on the farm.  So the first one was pick a carrot.  And that was again tied to this realization that the seed industry is really, the sales  was all, the sales channels, everything was really antiquated and there was no consolidated  information about seeds.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:34:01):**  So I worked with some friends from high school, actually really brilliant guys.  And we created an aggregator that connected, it basically takes all the US seed catalogs  and puts them into one searchable database.  So we're able to help people find seeds, compare prices and buy all with the click of a few  buttons.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:34:22):**  And that was pick a carrot, which is now undergoing some changes, but is still out there and you  can connect with thousands of farmers a year through it.  That's awesome.  And you mentioned another one?  Yeah.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:34:35):**  And this newer venture is a farm hospitality business called Sagra, like the Italian festivals  that take place.  And I'm advising on this business that's looking to use hospitality management as a revenue  driver and an awareness driver for regenerative farms.  So the idea is there's a working farm and to increase the bottom line, if they have  
**[0:35:00-0:35:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:35:00):**  the land, they can open up a partnership with Sagra and Sagra will run all the hospitality.  So the lodging, very lightweight lodging, like cabins or tents and dining on the property.  I love this idea.  It's something we, like you've hit on a bunch of themes of things we've been thinking a  lot about, but one is the need for, I guess, unusual partnerships in the future.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:35:24):**  And so you were mentioning historical aspects of seed production and modern techniques and  researchers and chefs and farmers, and just those people working together in maybe ways  they haven't.  And the other one is diversified revenue streams, which obviously is really important.  And then the third is connection to consumers and getting more people to understand and  
**[0:35:44-0:35:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:35:44):**  be interested in where food comes from.  And that kind of shift in understanding starts to move the needle.  So lots of really important themes there in the work that it sounds like you're doing  across a range of ventures you're involved in.  That's super exciting.  
**[0:35:58-0:35:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:35:58):**  Yeah.  And have you seen, I mean, where you are in the farmers you meet, have you seen that interest  from farmers to try to kind of layer or find partnership that are things like this?  Definitely.  We see a lot of value adding, of vertical integration, of looking at agritourism, of  
**[0:36:18-0:36:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:36:18):**  thinking about how to get closer to consumers and kind of earn more of each dollar and especially  diversified revenue streams, whether that's enterprise mix or actual other kinds of operations  like tourism, as I said, on the farm.  So we're seeing more of that.  I would say there's still, and I'd be curious if you see this or what the conversation's  
**[0:36:36-0:36:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:36:36):**  like where you are a pretty big divide.  Like there's a lot of pushback on regenerative agriculture.  It's a really polarizing term.  And even for people that I would say kind of agree with the principles or there's a  lot of the foundations that make sense, but this idea of regenerative is still highly  
**[0:36:53-0:36:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:36:53):**  polarizing.  And there's still a sort of us versus them of like the hobby, small scale, regen, feed  only rich people farms versus like real agriculture, which is large scale commodity, feed the whole  world, which I think is an interesting and probably pretty artificial dichotomy.  Absolutely.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:37:11):**  I mean, it's tense here too, and I think the social aspect of it is coming up too.  There's been a lot of talk about the quote unquote new concept of regenerative agriculture  and how it's really taking so much wisdom and knowledge from the past, people whose  land was taken from them.  And so, there's another layer even there.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:37:31):**  And I think, yeah, the discourse is real.  And I think at the end of the day, there has to be room for ecologically minded or thoughtfully  minded agriculture.  And I think that the largest players in the world are recognizing that too.  And it's not like you can just continue farming without considering the ecology.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:37:53):**  Like it's always going to come back in some way.  So I think it's just a matter of when that conversation comes up.  Some people are there now, some people were already there, and some people will come to  it in the future, at least in my opinion.  There's no denying that places like Stone Barns provoke a few different reactions.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:38:09):**  On one hand, it wouldn't exist without the help of wealthy benefactors, and yet farms  are businesses.  But at the same time, it's also a place where unencumbered experimentation can happen.  And it provides exposure to farming, which is a major barrier that limits people with  new perspectives from joining the industry.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:38:26):**  I think what Stone Barns did for me shows me a sign of what is really important as a  magnet, is this ability to be close enough that it can feel accessible.  Close enough that it's not, you know, like I was able to go to Stone Barns from my job  on a weekend.  Like it was only 30 minutes away to go to a farm that was doing really interesting work  
**[0:38:52-0:38:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:38:52):**  to get inspired.  Whereas other farms are generally in more rural areas.  And so to have to go that distance and to find that connection, also farms tend to be,  I mean, they're businesses, you know, there are nonprofit firms, but they're businesses  and farms are dangerous places.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:39:10):**  You know, Stone Barns has allowed for that accessibility.  And although it's very inaccessible to a lot of people still, it's a great bridge.  Because I don't think I would have driven four hours all those years ago to go look  at a farm and have that same connection, because this was a very real thing where I could come  back.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/2/24/can-a-small-non-profit-farm-near-nyc-change-the-food-system#t=0:39:28):**  I could have quit my job just to come back to see it.

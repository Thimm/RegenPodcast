    ### Agtech - So What?  (2018-06-06)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:00:00):**  Hi everyone, you're listening to BushTech, an agtech podcast that gets to the so what  of agtech. We'll bring you interesting things from interesting people and I'm one of your  co-hosts Simon Mathewson. And I'm your other co-host Sarah Nolette. On this podcast we  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:00:15):**  will bring in leading speakers in technology, entrepreneurship, investment, agriculture,  science and anything else you can think of and we can find in the world of agtech. We'll  look to demystify it so that we're getting to the so what. What does it really mean for  
**[0:00:28-0:00:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:00:28):**  farmers and for the broader agricultural industry? So Brooke Sawyer, welcome to the BushTech  podcast. Thanks Sarah. Great to have you. So I'd love to just start with a bit about  your background if you want to give us a small overview. Yeah, my background is actually  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:00:57):**  really quite different to this. I'm actually an agricultural geneticist and went to go  into plant breeding and then ended up moving into more extension type work and did a lot  with controlled traffic and no till farming about 15 years ago. And then sort of by default  
**[0:01:12-0:01:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:01:12):**  ended up moving into precision agriculture where I started my PhD and then yeah, now  we've sort of moved out of sort of private enterprise into the government and back out  into private enterprise again now with McGregor Goolway. And what did you do your PhD on?  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:01:27):**  I actually did my PhD on pretty much in precision agriculture, looking at the use of different  tools and how they could be helpful on highly constrained subsoil in Northern New South Wales.  Right. And would you say that the technologies or the space has changed significantly in  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:01:44):**  that time period or is it still like really relevant? The technology itself probably hasn't  changed. The technology that I was looking at, we were very simple things like EM and  remote sensing and yield data and they're probably still three main layers that I use  
**[0:01:59-0:02:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:01:59):**  today in my work. So the relevance of my PhD work is still very much alive and being used  as it is right now. That's awesome. Exciting. So tell us a bit about McGregor Goolway and  you guys aren't a precision ag company. You're part of precision ag. You've started the precision  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:02:19):**  ag division there for them. So yeah, tell us a bit about them and then what you do for  them. Yeah, I guess McGregor Goolway is just a regular sort of normal agribusiness. We  sell inputs to farmers basically and we provide an agronomy service as part of that. And I  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:02:33):**  guess McGregor Goolway really just sort of looked outside the square and saw people starting  to look for information in this digital space and rather than wanting to find that digital  information outside of their business, they decided they thought it was probably best  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:02:47):**  to try and I guess create a service in this space. Not really understanding what that  would involve or what it would look like or how it would happen. And so at the time I  was working for the government and they came and asked me and said, can you talk to us  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:03:02):**  about this? What should we be doing? Should we be buying equipment? Should we be buying  a drone or what have you? And I said, no, I think the greatest hurdle in the whole precision  ag space is more about the support required to move forward and to adopt and take on technology  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:03:18):**  because it's not necessarily a whole new farming system. It's just using tools in a different  way and developing or finding information from different sources. So at the end of that  conversation they sort of was like, okay, I think you need to come work for us. So that's  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:03:33):**  really how it all kind of started. And three years ago when I started to now, they were  very sensible by not ever really giving me a job description, which I think at the time  was more because they didn't really understand what I did or how it would work. But I guess  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:03:48):**  the things that make up my day and the core part of my work has evolved so much. The ethos  of this role hasn't changed, which has always been about trying to help our customers to  understand the value proposition of using digital technology and information derived  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:05):**  from remote sensing tools and working out that opportunity to improve their own productivity.  So that business ethos has never changed, but I guess the other things that we do to  compliment that has evolved greatly.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:18):**  Yeah. So maybe talk a little bit about that. What would you say has evolved around it?  Is it more like different kinds of services? Is it that the technology's evolved so there's  more range of tools that you're using or what's really changing?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:30):**  There's probably a couple of ways that it's really evolved. Three years ago, if you'd  asked me if we would be working side by side with startup companies, I probably would have  said no. And two, if you'd asked me if I was ever going to buy a drone, it would be no.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:45):**  But probably more, the thing that probably hasn't changed is the way in which we try  and engage our customers or the things that we try and achieve for our customers, but  maybe the way we engage them has evolved quite a lot. So we've gone away from probably sort  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:59):**  of these traditional extension models of trying to engage, engage, engage with people and  gone more towards an individualistic and almost a tailored approach that we literally go in,  sit down and say, okay, what are the issues? And then we utilise the technology to say,  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:05:16):**  okay, we need to generate more information about this because we need to know how much  this issue is costing you and therefore what is the potential for you to make more money  in this situation? So we don't tend to probably look at throwing out packages to people saying,  
**[0:05:30-0:05:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:05:30):**  okay, you give me $5 a hectare every year and you'll get 15 satellite images and all  of your yield data processed and maybe an EM38 survey thrown in for that. It's less  about this whole pushing of package and more about probably starting at the ground up.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:05:48):**  Right. So a bit more of like a consultation model. You're almost like consultants to them  saying like, here's how we think the business can improve or here's the different tools  you would need. So is that a quite different skill set almost that you would then need  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:02):**  to do the kind of understanding of their business and their needs and then also matching it  to the technology? And then do you guys implement the service for them as well if that's the  case?  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:12):**  Yeah, to a certain degree we do. Most of the time I guess the implementation of something  moving forward to make more money is generally utilising technology that they already have  in their tractor anyway. So the solution always encompasses where they're at with technology  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:25):**  in terms of ownership of hardware but also where their mindset is at as well. What they  feel comfortable with, what they don't feel comfortable with. Because at the end of the  day in order to improve productivity it all comes down to confidence level. And each grower  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:39):**  has to be confident in what I'm presenting to them in terms of digital data because they're  not used to seeing things that way. So they need to trust the data in itself. They need  to have a level of trust in me that I'm presenting data to them because we all know that data  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:54):**  can be skewed whichever way you want to tell the story. And then they need to have confidence  in themselves that they can do just that and that it is going to make them more money or  it is going to save on inputs or they're going to make more and things like that. So I mean  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:09):**  it doesn't always just come down to profitability. I mean there's a certain amount of environmental  drive and provenance that surrounds a lot of this side of things as well. So I mean  firstly and foremost I don't think you'll find very many farmers out there that are  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:24):**  not the first priority isn't to make more money. But they're also very much concerned  about creating products that are safe and clean and green and utilising the technology  to be able to do to be able to prove that to be able to make a case into the future  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:38):**  where everybody's so much more concerned about where the food comes from being able to say  okay well that's that's great that you want to know where it's come from and I can tell  you everything that's happened in this place. And that's a slow moving thing. It's not something  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:51):**  that's at great pace at the moment but it is something that growers are starting to  become more and more aware of. And I think definitely in that thought process of going  okay well you know it is something that I need to consider because I don't want to be  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:08:04):**  left with you know 200 tonne of wheat that I can't sell or 30 bales of cotton that nobody  wants to buy.  I think the confidence point is really interesting. I'm curious how that plays out. Like do you  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:08:16):**  can you just tell right away when someone's like oh like you know I thought I had to hear  this presentation but I'm really not confident in using this or like can you kind of tell  right away how keen they're going to be or is it much more subtle in terms of like taking  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:08:29):**  them through a training or like just kind of how does that play out in practice?  Every situation is different to be honest with you. I am in some you know very quickly  I mean we don't try to tend to push things. We don't actively sell or anything and 95%  
**[0:08:48-0:08:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:08:48):**  of my business comes from people contacting me generally. So it's a slightly I guess it's  quite a different model straight up and when people tend to contact me sometimes it's out  of desperation. You know it's because it's incredibly dry and to be respectful somewhat  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:09:08):**  misguided thinking that if I kind of move into precision ag then I'm automatically going  to save on my input bill. You know I'm going to put less fertiliser out and I'm going to  make more money. That's just a common misconception that's out there. It might not always be so  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:09:20):**  blatant but it's a common misconception. And so dry weather and dry times when it hasn't  rained and this you know this need to put a crop in the ground but wanting to have the  least amount of risk up front is generally sometimes the driver that comes forward. And  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:09:37):**  then it kind of rains and people kind of blend back into the background and sort of go well  you know look I'm making money as it is there's no real need for me to change. But you know  the confidence I guess getting back to the question that you asked me being able to determine  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:09:51):**  that confidence level. Look some people will come and as soon as I sort of explain to them  it's not quite about saving money on fertiliser it's about robbing Peter to pay Paul and putting  it you know with that fertiliser where you can get the greatest bang for buck with it.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:10:05):**  People often say people sort of tend to draw back a little bit because all of a sudden  it's sort of like well what about that one in five year when I have all of that fertiliser  left over that's just kind of sitting there and it becomes abundant. And it's about convincing  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:10:18):**  people to think outside the square and that it's not that what they've done for the last  40 years is wrong because nothing is ever wrong. It's about sort of recognising that  it might not necessarily be a limitation but there's an opportunity there. And that takes  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:10:33):**  a long time and to be honest with you that's very much a people skill building process.  It's about having that relationship with people, it's about going to the local footy field  and being there, being at the Christmas parties, being and so my life is filled with social  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:10:49):**  events as much as it is with actually talking to growers you know on a business level because  you know and I need to get to know their wife because she is the driver of the business  in the background and you know knowing their children and things like that. So it's very  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:11:05):**  much about becoming an integrated part of the community as much as it is about being  a successful consultant and being able to walk the walk and talk the talk. It's about  having the people skills to negotiate. So the way in which people respond to me is different.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:11:21):**  Every person requires I guess a different way of engaging in them and over time especially  having that background working extension in no-till and control traffic as well has sort  of taught me a lot of really valuable skills on being able to recognise when somebody's  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:11:36):**  kind of living away from the conversation and taking a different tact and organising  my thoughts in a completely different way. And it's not necessarily about this hard sell  of you know getting everybody doing the same thing, it's more about generally they've always  
**[0:11:52-0:11:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:11:52):**  come to me. So it's about me you know I see it as a success when I've helped them to understand  what's going on in their farm, what their current limitations are and what they cost,  what they're costing the business and where the opportunities might exist. That's sort  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:12:08):**  of where the success story ends really, whether or not they kind of do anything with that  is not so much about me, it's about them. They have to be the one that chooses to go  forward and I don't necessarily look at it as a failure if they don't move forward because  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:12:24):**  there's a lot of other things that are at play aside from this just moving forward with  technology. So yeah it's a really interesting job, like everybody's different, every day  is different.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:12:37):**  It sounds like one thing that I think is really interesting is the, you said like working  with start-ups and one thing that gets talked about in the start-up community is how relationship  based agriculture is, like exactly like you just said. So for a start-up that maybe doesn't  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:12:53):**  have the community or expertise or like boots on the ground where you are or is looking  to maybe even disrupt that and have things be more digitally based or sign up for something  online via an app. Like I don't know, what's your experience been working with the start-up  
**[0:13:08-0:13:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:13:08):**  community and do you see things moving more towards a digital space where you are still  based on relationships and community but everything's not done via like a face to face sale. For  example you might be buying things online or downloading an app to use a product.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:13:25):**  Yeah that's a really interesting question, not one that I probably am super confident  in answering really well. I guess it is really hard having worked with start-ups and creating  sort of these digital technologies that are about connecting information and bringing  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:13:43):**  information together and ultimately achieving some sort of a decision support tool that  ultimately will disrupt positions like mine I guess and my work colleagues like agronomists  and things like that. There's lots of questions about whether or not we will even have jobs  
**[0:13:59-0:14:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:13:59):**  in the future. So I mean I think that there will always be an impetus for growers to still  want to have relationships with people. Being a farmer is quite an isolating thing and you  know I guess over say take Moree for example when I first moved there we had 15,000 people  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:14:16):**  living in Moree. I think at the moment we've been down to 7,000 and the impact that that's  had on the community has been unimaginable. There are so many businesses that are closing  down and there's so many businesses that are on the brink of when we have water and there's  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:14:32):**  plenty of cotton in the ground they do well but they're not big enough businesses that  when we have a little bit of drought or we don't have a lot of water and the confidence  level or the outlook for the following season isn't fantastic they're the businesses that  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:14:45):**  tend to struggle and pack up and leave and then that affects the amount of kids in schools  and things like that. So every farmer I think is always very conscious about how technology  is going to impact and I don't think anybody knows the real answer but how it will potentially  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:14:59):**  impact not just the way that they do business but the community and the place that their  local school land where they buy their local chemical from and their fertilizer from and  creating more and more jobs. It's a really difficult question to answer. I don't doubt  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:15:19):**  for a minute that online shopping which plenty of people do in the bush we're not adverse  to buying things online, we do it plenty of times and utilising apps and technology to  create more efficiencies within business. Absolutely no doubt that people are not going  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:15:34):**  to do that. More and more farmers I guess are utilising seeking information from alternate  sources it's not about picking up the land or the rural newspaper anymore it's about  being on Twitter and being part of things like you know OzChat and things like that  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:15:51):**  to be sourcing information from. Twitter is a huge source of information for people and  I think the more that people feel comfortable getting information from digital sides of  things will transcend into more confidence in being able to trust remotely collected  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:16:06):**  data or remote sensing information. I think that the time is coming now that people are  feeling more confident with it but I think there's still a little way to go before they  completely rely on a whole completely analysed digital decision support tool that ultimately  
**[0:16:25-0:16:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:16:25):**  says okay grow this crop here now, not tomorrow now and put this much here and that. I think  that people like myself and agronomists and stuff like that, very few people are probably  utilising the technology themselves that can make how they do their job better to be honest  
**[0:16:46-0:16:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:16:46):**  with you. We had a really classic example at work a few months ago where we had a young  agronomist who had not long been in the business but really keen user of technology come straight  out of uni really being able to utilise all of these digital ag tools incredibly well  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:17:04):**  and you know users set them up on a regular basis, jumps on, had a look and for a cotton  field that he wasn't actually providing the agronomy service for but was being paid, a  private agronomist was being paid an incredible amount of money to look after that cotton  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:17:20):**  field but he just happened to notice that the inside wasn't doing as well as it probably  should be of a pivot and so he jumped the fence and it's not as though he wasn't allowed  to be on his property but he wasn't being paid to look after this cotton crop, jumped  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:17:34):**  the fence, walked all the way into the centre of the pivot and went oh the sprinklers aren't  turned on, whoops and they've been like that for quite a few weeks but you know the very  highly paid agronomist who has 25 years of experience looking after cotton because he  
**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:17:48):**  wasn't utilising tools like this and no one farmer expects an agronomist to walk every  hectare of every field but it's having that digital technology which is freely available  to everybody to just sort of go okay there's something going on in that just pure reflectance  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:06):**  map it's not going to tell me anything specific, it's not going to say it's a disease but there's  something going on there that requires a few you know set of boots in the field to really  kind of translate what's going on but it didn't happen by this you know well experienced guy  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:20):**  and you know it's one of those things that there's so much technology available to all  of our agronomists right now but so few of them are utilising them to help them do their  job better.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:31):**  Why do you think that is?  I think there's a couple of reasons, a little bit of ignorance, I won't deny that, there's  a bit of ignorance there and there's a little bit of apprehension about how these tools  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:43):**  are going to potentially replace them I think you know it's sort of like if I don't take  any notice of them then they don't really exist and I don't need to face them but I  think there's also to be fair to agronomists we're not all ignorant completely but to be  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:57):**  fair I think one of the greatest challenges for us is that most agronomists are already  so busy and they're looking after so many people and as you know farming is highly dynamic  so nothing is ever the same in each every week so they've got to be on their toes all  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:19:13):**  the time thinking about different things thinking about what it could be or what they should  be doing or what's the next crop and if I make this decision now how is it going to  impact the farmers choices for next year just say chickpea prices go you know rock bottom  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:19:28):**  and he changes that to wheat what's this decision going to do to impact that decision next year.  So there's always a lot going on I think and they're always really busy thinking about  things and to have to think about something different in a different way is sometimes  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:19:42):**  just a bit of a I will I'll do that but I'll just do it next week you know because I'm  a little bit busy right now and then also to be fair as well I mean things like Saturn  Map as a tool which is just sentinel data pulled into a really nice easy to use platform  
**[0:19:56-0:20:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:19:56):**  but it requires another login and we've been working with the providers with software that  we use which is Agworld to integrate this information in there and so it doesn't need  to be a be all and end all wholly successful you know providing a monumental amount of  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:15):**  analytics but it just needs to be in the same place that they do the recommendations because  they don't need to log out and log into something else that requires internet connection where  they don't have any then they're much more likely to be able to use it so just I think  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:30):**  just sometimes it's the simple things that can make such a big difference to an agronomist  utilizing that information and then he's showing his customer or his grow and saying hey I  check this out isn't this funky you know when you were planting the other day you said you  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:45):**  had problems with the seeder well this is what the impact is you know having all of  those levels of information at somebody's fingertips without the reliance on an internet  connection.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:55):**  It's funny people say that that's like a like that challenge gets brought up a lot and it's  not an ag one like this weekend I was working and I realized my Google Drive wasn't synced  up with my online Google Drive and so my files weren't syncing and I went to sign in and  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:09):**  then it needed a login and I didn't have it and then like it was just too many steps and  so I finally was like whatever I just won't sync it right and it's like that's not the  right answer the right answer is just like do the thing that will take 30 seconds to  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:20):**  get your files to sync but instead I was like ah it's too hard I can't be bothered and then  we sort of expect that other people are gonna do this extra work when like I'm pretty tech  savvy and I just I couldn't be bothered like I just wouldn't do it so I think it's kind  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:31):**  of funny that we sometimes we hold different groups to different standards but yeah that's  where the usability needs to come in like having you know the password manager hook  up to this and that and just kind of integrate all the systems will help a lot I think.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:44):**  Yeah absolutely I mean I think a lot of the the programs or the platforms that are being  used like there's probably three main ones here in Australia and we use Agworld and I'm  not advocating it's just the road that we went down and but you know they're making  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:59):**  some really big in-road steps to be to have all of our soil tests coming into one place  and having our yield data integrated into that obviously pre-processed so it's nice  and clean and usable but also having our you know satellite imagery not that we place a  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:13):**  huge amount of emphasis on satellite imagery but it's a really handy layer to have so having  all of these really useful information means that when a grower steps out in the or when  a grower steps out in the field be it with or without his grower or a grower is looking  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:27):**  at the same data when they go out into the field they have every bit of information that's  there when they're making a decision okay well should I be putting fertiliser on now  or not you know he's got some long range forecasts about what's going to happen you know he's  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:39):**  got some historical data around that field because he's got a weather station in there  and you know he's got all the information about previous soil tests and with locations  against them which is you know seems like an instant yeah very simple thing but the  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:52):**  amount of soil tests that are around with our within our business that do not have a  geotag with them is unbelievable but again it's one of those simple processes of okay  I need a program that allows me to pinpoint something that's going to fix that to my recommendation  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:23:08):**  you know based tools so you know I think the technology that we have around us is amazing  but there's this real disconnect on bringing it all together so that we can use it in a  really sensible way yeah I wanted to ask you so I know one of the startups you're working  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:23:24):**  with is Florissat and they use drones or you help them to collect a bit of drone data and  you mentioned drones before as something that you didn't think you'd be using but now are  so yeah maybe tell me a little bit about your journey with drones in particular and their  
**[0:23:38-0:23:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:23:38):**  technology that's had lots of hype around it and now lots of reality around it that  you're seeing as well so what's that been like okay so I guess I was always a little  skeptical of drones and and I'm to be realistic I probably look at myself as a little bit  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:23:54):**  of a glass half full kind of girl I tend to look at things with a lot of skepticism and  then it needs to kind of prove to me or I need to look at it and a bit and and it analytically  I guess to be able to then say okay you know what I think this is a worthwhile and I see  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:24:08):**  a plausible way how this could provide great information or it could provide a great solution  and I was always a little skeptical of drones but my my general manager is a really avid  pilot and was so keen he's just like Brooke find me a way that we can justify buying a  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:24:25):**  drone and I was like oh really okay are we going down this road so that's you know we  we went to a couple of workshops and we listened to you know things about drones and I was  still a little skeptical but Josh was like right we're getting into this drone thing  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:24:39):**  so we really just sort of started selling drones and it was quite by accident we decided  to get a few for our agros use them out the field see how practical they really were see  how useful they were in terms of can we see more things at a greater height and I guess  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:24:56):**  more than anything how practical they really were and then a couple of our customers said  oh can you buy one for us or can you buy one for us and nearly three years down the track  we have sold over 600 drawings which is just I'm sure there's not even that many farmers  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:25:11):**  in the north of New South Wales but we have drones all over Australia now and it's crazy  so we've learned a lot about just simple you know things like a phantom just a really simple  little multi rotor people using them in very different ways no one's trying to save the  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:25:25):**  planet with them but using them just as a evaluating tool that or an extra set of eyes  in the sky and then obviously we were working with fluoresce and we purchased the big drone  that we call Lizzie which is just a matrice and we purchased that to run a whole heap  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:25:40):**  of sensors to help them with their development work and having come out the back end of that  we've now put Lizzie in the cupboard so Lizzie's been banished back to the big cupboard now  and I guess really we had a lot of issues and that put me off a lot I mean just simple  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:25:57):**  things admittedly there was nobody else in Australia at the time that was trying to run  three different sensors on a multi rotor platform and trying to power everything at once so  electronically we had a lot of serious issues going on and not a lot of people around to  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:26:12):**  help us go if you plug this in here and you plug this in here you're going to get abracadabra  everything's going to work because it was never quite that simple so I mean aside from  that and that's just an individual situation but one of the greatest issues that we found  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:26:26):**  with the drone was especially in a really large broad acu sense was the great it was  incredibly inefficient so and then all of the work that we did with them you know with  with fluoresce that required flying under very specific circumstances which whenever  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:26:42):**  you're collecting remotely sensed information especially with a passive sensor that we were  using required really nice good sunshine or complete cloud and we had 11 fields that we  were flying for fluoresce and roughly worked out to be about once every four weeks we were  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:27:01):**  supposed to fly well by the time we got through the first one we were about about three months  behind schedule because it was either too windy or it was too cloudy or we just didn't  have enough hours in the day to get there and back again and not only that but at best  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:27:18):**  we were getting around 40 hectares which sounds like a reasonable amount but even these irrigation  fields the smallest field that we had was 120 hectares we were only collecting a third  of the data so by the time we would have collected all of that data it would have been probably  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:27:31):**  taken three days to do it all and that was multiple sets of batteries with charging hubs  and generators and everything that we could think of that would make our process easier  we used but unfortunately it was just the nature of the beast and then obviously putting  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:27:48):**  it on a different sort of drone wasn't an option we needed a fair bit of lift power  so a fixed wing was out of the equation and to cut a long story short like I said Liz  is in the shed and we've gone to a manned plane instead.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:02):**  Interesting and has that changed your view on drones?  Do you still think drones are useful but just that some of the technology has to develop  to enable some of these sensors or is it like what's your view on having actually worked  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:17):**  quite closely with these technologies now?  To be honest with you kind of going down the drone road and coming out the other end and  kind of moving away from drones has made me realise one thing and that a lot of people  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:29):**  are very very obsessed and really not obsessed but really excited by the drone itself and  you know that's the big kid in all of us you know I don't know many people that don't ever  remember flying remote controlled helicopters and absolutely loving because there's this  
**[0:28:43-0:28:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:43):**  sense of being able to control something else but to be honest with you I guess the technology  will evolve it will continue to evolve there will be drones that will be able to do things  that we can't do now and that are they're unable to do right now or they're inefficient  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:59):**  at completing right now but to be honest with you I'm probably less excited about the actual  drone and more excited about what the the way in which people are thinking drones can  to deliver something so I gave a talk recently to a bunch of farmers who had asked me to  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:13):**  come and talk about drones thinking I'd go there and go oh blah blah and let's be super  excited about drones and I just kind of walked in said look I'm going to burst your bubble  right away and you know I'm not the biggest advocate of drones and this is why and this  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:27):**  was my experience and the biggest take home message that I said to these guys was be more  excited about the data itself because lots of them were kind of like can we could you  think there's potential to be able to measure pH from the sky using a drain is there ability  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:42):**  to venture measure different changes in soil type and what that could potentially mean  and I'm like you can do all of that now you don't need a drone to do that like and it's  so much more efficient to do it without a drone so you know people are excited about  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:55):**  all the things that they think drones can deliver but they need to forget about the  drone and be more excited about what it is that they think that is going to they're going  to get from that information because that's the serious game changer the drones just like  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:08):**  a tractor yeah at the end of the day I found the same thing that when you that some of  these technologies can either be exciting just because they're exciting technologies  or can be sort of scary because they seem far away or seem like useless and futuristic  
**[0:30:23-0:30:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:23):**  but once you get into the use case like once you're actually talking about oh it can measure  this or it could do that or we can hook this up to that then the conversation really flips  and you start to get into like a brainstorming solution excitement mode around oh well then  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:36):**  can we hook up to that and it's not to say that there aren't huge challenges but that  you can kind of change from just exciting in a toy kind of playing way or super skeptical  and into like oh this could be really valuable how do we think about solving problems and  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:50):**  I think that's where I'm seeing a lot more of that and I think that's really exciting  for the kind of future of precision ag and ag tech more broadly so I think that's really  it's good to hear that you've experienced that as well.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:02):**  In terms of startups are you like what was it like to work with a startup because they're  different in terms of you know faster but also you know not fully established companies  with products that already you know necessarily work all the time or exist you're obviously  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:16):**  doing a lot of testing and helping with development is like what's it been like for a company  like yours and for you to work with startups that really aren't you know like probably  other businesses that you've maybe experienced in terms of how big they are how fast they  
**[0:31:30-0:31:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:30):**  are what has that been like?  To be honest with you at the end of this cotton season you know very privately people sort  of say oh you know how's it been working with startups and I say it nearly killed me it  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:42):**  really did nearly kill me and not so much because of the actual working with startups  I think it was probably more the commercial development and trying to fast track something  in the field on behalf of a company that you have no financial stake in you know trying  
**[0:31:56-0:32:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:56):**  to fast track R&D essentially in a non fast trackable way was really stressful and being  at the mercy of all the things that every farmer is at the mercy of environmental conditions  weather and all those things just never quite playing the way we wanted to so that was it  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:32:13):**  was a really kind of stressful situation I won't deny that but in terms of actually probably  working with a startup you know there was plenty of times where you know I they would  ask my opinion of something and I didn't always agree with their opinion and I didn't always  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:32:30):**  give them the answer that they wanted to hear and but that I think that's been a really  valuable exercise for everybody involved because I've sort of brought something completely  different to their business that they wouldn't have thought of which was the practicality  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:32:43):**  of doing things actually in the field and the practicality of how useful the information  that they're trying to develop could be but it needs to be considered around X, Y and  Z so I think you know I was able to bring them ground them a little bit and bring them  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:32:58):**  back to earth but then it sort of taught me a lot of other things as well it taught me  to probably appreciate a lot more how much effort goes into R&D and developing things  for the future and irrespective of whatever comes of fluoro sat you know I've learnt a  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:33:16):**  lot and can take a lot back to the customer even if it isn't a finished product it's about  sort of thinking about things in a completely different way and it's about thinking outside  the square for a solution to every problem and that's something that I've gotten a lot  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:33:30):**  from working with a startup so much so that even though I you know two minutes ago I said  to you that nearly killed me but you know we're sort of on this journey now of okay  I would like to do more of that you know I really I'm really enjoying being able to be  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:33:44):**  at that at the core and the epicentre of things that are new and exciting and we really love  that and our customers love that we are part of something that is new whether or not it  eventuates into anything is almost irrelevant but being able to sort of offer that connect  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:01):**  between the farmer and the startup and being able to bring some perspective to them and  say actually that issue isn't so important to us but this is and at those very early  stages of the startup and being able to sort of help guide them and their you know their  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:16):**  enterprise to being something that's really tangible and really useful on the ground is  kind of special.  Yeah totally and I think ag tech need more people like that like need more translation  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:27):**  functions between the real requirements and the technologies and the technologies and  the requirements and get that boots on the ground practical perspective and to your point  before to get that kind of person embedded in the community that can help to tell the  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:42):**  story of where this is going and have that conversation over a longer period of time  instead of you know coming and presenting at a conference and then leaving and hoping  they you know something happens it's just going to go a bit slower than that you have  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:53):**  to build up that trust and understand so I think that's a huge reason why it's so exciting  that you're doing what you're doing I think it's so important.  So if you're looking for other startups what kinds of startups would you be looking for  
**[0:35:06-0:35:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:06):**  like what's an area that's exciting?  Oh that's a really good question.  Probably the thing that probably excites me the most in the ag tech space really is probably  
**[0:35:16-0:35:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:16):**  a little bit more in that midstream it's about sort of connecting all this information together  and creating helping girls to be able to create that provenance so you know that's where I'm  probably most excited at the moment having said that you know I'm working with other  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:31):**  startups that are very specific and a very specific product in you know in pastures for  example and it's not something that I know a lot about but I'm still you know I still  think that I can bring maybe not the agronomic knowledge but something else valuable to their  
**[0:35:45-0:35:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:45):**  business and you know McGregor Goolay where you know we only have 13 branches which is  probably fairly large for an agribusiness standard but in terms of trying to connect  with all of Australian farmers is you know we're very small fish in the sea but you know  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:00):**  we're part of a bigger group which is national and that's what we're trying to develop now  is we're trying to sort of get more and more people involved in businesses that are like  ours that can offer a completely different perspective you know the planes Liverpool  
**[0:36:14-0:36:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:14):**  Plains is completely different to northern New South Wales and we're only 300 kilometres  apart and so you know if we can create more and more connect between businesses throughout  Australia and that ag tech space I think it could be really positive for everybody and  
**[0:36:31-0:36:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:31):**  of course you know there's going to be more and more people that are more interested in  one particular ag tech space than another but I guess you know getting back to your  question something that really ties everything together I'm probably less interested in the  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:44):**  big individual piece of information that you know will revolutionise everything and it's  not that you know fluoresce that's a great example that is a very specific product looking  at you know a nitrogen or a nutritional status of the plant at any given point in time but  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:58):**  you know that information by itself is not so exciting to me but that information as  part of a much bigger set of data it can be really really you know really influential  really valuable for a grower particularly in a system where you have all of that data  
**[0:37:14-0:37:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:37:14):**  in a platform all together where you can go in and sort of say okay well this is what  my nitrogen status is right now at this given point in time on this field but I also know  this part of the field doesn't perform so I'm making a much more informed decision about  
**[0:37:28-0:37:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:37:28):**  what to do with that and less about going you know okay my nitrogen is variable and  spinning out a variable rate map from that it's probably about you know putting that  into context of how do I then turn that into something to make the best decision possible  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:37:45):**  so yeah I think that is where many at least of the startups I talked to really want to  get to and there's it's been good to see an increased focus in the tech community on decision  making and decision support and connecting it to ROI and what's the so what here not  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:37:59):**  just maps or data for data's sake I think the reality of how we actually do that and  how these systems talk to each other and what the user experience is that's the part to  still be sorted out but it's good to see everyone yeah we'll speak in the same language so and  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:38:16):**  that kind of comes back to what you actually say on your LinkedIn profile which I love  which is around demystifying precision ag and this it's not just with farmers and talking  about the new tools and that precision ag isn't new it's just a new set of tools or  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:38:30):**  continually evolving set of tools but that it's also with the rest of the agribusiness  community too about how do we look at new tools and how do we work with new players  like startups or research organizations so I think that is super fantastic and thank

### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 08:25:17)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:00:00):**  Hi everyone, you're listening to BushTech, an agtech podcast that gets to the so what  
**[0:00:04-0:00:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:00:04):**  of agtech. We'll bring you interesting things from interesting people and I'm one of your  
**[0:00:09-0:00:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:00:09):**  co-hosts Simon Mathewson. And I'm your other co-host Sarah Nolette. On this podcast we  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:00:15):**  will bring in leading speakers in technology, entrepreneurship, investment, agriculture,  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:00:20):**  science and anything else you can think of and we can find in the world of agtech. We'll  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:00:24):**  look to demystify it so that we're getting to the so what. What does it really mean for  
**[0:00:28-0:00:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:00:28):**  farmers and for the broader agricultural industry? So Brooke Sawyer, welcome to the BushTech  
**[0:00:45-0:00:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:00:45):**  podcast. Thanks Sarah. Great to have you. So I'd love to just start with a bit about  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:00:51):**  your background if you want to give us a small overview. Yeah, my background is actually  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:00:57):**  really quite different to this. I'm actually an agricultural geneticist and went to go  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:01:01):**  into plant breeding and then ended up moving into more extension type work and did a lot  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:01:07):**  with controlled traffic and no till farming about 15 years ago. And then sort of by default  
**[0:01:12-0:01:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:01:12):**  ended up moving into precision agriculture where I started my PhD and then yeah, now  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:01:18):**  we've sort of moved out of sort of private enterprise into the government and back out  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:01:22):**  into private enterprise again now with McGregor Goolway. And what did you do your PhD on?  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:01:27):**  I actually did my PhD on pretty much in precision agriculture, looking at the use of different  
**[0:01:32-0:01:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:01:32):**  tools and how they could be helpful on highly constrained subsoil in Northern New South Wales.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:01:39):**  Right. And would you say that the technologies or the space has changed significantly in  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:01:44):**  that time period or is it still like really relevant? The technology itself probably hasn't  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:01:49):**  changed. The technology that I was looking at, we were very simple things like EM and  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:01:54):**  remote sensing and yield data and they're probably still three main layers that I use  
**[0:01:59-0:02:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:01:59):**  today in my work. So the relevance of my PhD work is still very much alive and being used  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:02:08):**  as it is right now. That's awesome. Exciting. So tell us a bit about McGregor Goolway and  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:02:14):**  you guys aren't a precision ag company. You're part of precision ag. You've started the precision  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:02:19):**  ag division there for them. So yeah, tell us a bit about them and then what you do for  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:02:23):**  them. Yeah, I guess McGregor Goolway is just a regular sort of normal agribusiness. We  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:02:28):**  sell inputs to farmers basically and we provide an agronomy service as part of that. And I  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:02:33):**  guess McGregor Goolway really just sort of looked outside the square and saw people starting  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:02:38):**  to look for information in this digital space and rather than wanting to find that digital  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:02:43):**  information outside of their business, they decided they thought it was probably best  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:02:47):**  to try and I guess create a service in this space. Not really understanding what that  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:02:52):**  would involve or what it would look like or how it would happen. And so at the time I  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:02:59):**  was working for the government and they came and asked me and said, can you talk to us  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:03:02):**  about this? What should we be doing? Should we be buying equipment? Should we be buying  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:03:06):**  a drone or what have you? And I said, no, I think the greatest hurdle in the whole precision  
**[0:03:10-0:03:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:03:10):**  ag space is more about the support required to move forward and to adopt and take on technology  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:03:18):**  because it's not necessarily a whole new farming system. It's just using tools in a different  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:03:23):**  way and developing or finding information from different sources. So at the end of that  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:03:29):**  conversation they sort of was like, okay, I think you need to come work for us. So that's  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:03:33):**  really how it all kind of started. And three years ago when I started to now, they were  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:03:39):**  very sensible by not ever really giving me a job description, which I think at the time  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:03:43):**  was more because they didn't really understand what I did or how it would work. But I guess  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:03:48):**  the things that make up my day and the core part of my work has evolved so much. The ethos  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:03:54):**  of this role hasn't changed, which has always been about trying to help our customers to  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:00):**  understand the value proposition of using digital technology and information derived  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:05):**  from remote sensing tools and working out that opportunity to improve their own productivity.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:11):**  So that business ethos has never changed, but I guess the other things that we do to  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:16):**  compliment that has evolved greatly.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:18):**  Yeah. So maybe talk a little bit about that. What would you say has evolved around it?  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:22):**  Is it more like different kinds of services? Is it that the technology's evolved so there's  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:26):**  more range of tools that you're using or what's really changing?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:30):**  There's probably a couple of ways that it's really evolved. Three years ago, if you'd  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:34):**  asked me if we would be working side by side with startup companies, I probably would have  
**[0:04:38-0:04:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:38):**  said no. And two, if you'd asked me if I was ever going to buy a drone, it would be no.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:45):**  But probably more, the thing that probably hasn't changed is the way in which we try  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:50):**  and engage our customers or the things that we try and achieve for our customers, but  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:53):**  maybe the way we engage them has evolved quite a lot. So we've gone away from probably sort  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:04:59):**  of these traditional extension models of trying to engage, engage, engage with people and  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:05:04):**  gone more towards an individualistic and almost a tailored approach that we literally go in,  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:05:10):**  sit down and say, okay, what are the issues? And then we utilise the technology to say,  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:05:16):**  okay, we need to generate more information about this because we need to know how much  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:05:19):**  this issue is costing you and therefore what is the potential for you to make more money  
**[0:05:23-0:05:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:05:23):**  in this situation? So we don't tend to probably look at throwing out packages to people saying,  
**[0:05:30-0:05:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:05:30):**  okay, you give me $5 a hectare every year and you'll get 15 satellite images and all  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:05:38):**  of your yield data processed and maybe an EM38 survey thrown in for that. It's less  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:05:43):**  about this whole pushing of package and more about probably starting at the ground up.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:05:48):**  Right. So a bit more of like a consultation model. You're almost like consultants to them  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:05:53):**  saying like, here's how we think the business can improve or here's the different tools  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:05:57):**  you would need. So is that a quite different skill set almost that you would then need  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:02):**  to do the kind of understanding of their business and their needs and then also matching it  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:07):**  to the technology? And then do you guys implement the service for them as well if that's the  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:11):**  case?  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:12):**  Yeah, to a certain degree we do. Most of the time I guess the implementation of something  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:16):**  moving forward to make more money is generally utilising technology that they already have  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:20):**  in their tractor anyway. So the solution always encompasses where they're at with technology  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:25):**  in terms of ownership of hardware but also where their mindset is at as well. What they  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:29):**  feel comfortable with, what they don't feel comfortable with. Because at the end of the  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:33):**  day in order to improve productivity it all comes down to confidence level. And each grower  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:39):**  has to be confident in what I'm presenting to them in terms of digital data because they're  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:45):**  not used to seeing things that way. So they need to trust the data in itself. They need  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:50):**  to have a level of trust in me that I'm presenting data to them because we all know that data  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:06:54):**  can be skewed whichever way you want to tell the story. And then they need to have confidence  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:00):**  in themselves that they can do just that and that it is going to make them more money or  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:05):**  it is going to save on inputs or they're going to make more and things like that. So I mean  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:09):**  it doesn't always just come down to profitability. I mean there's a certain amount of environmental  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:14):**  drive and provenance that surrounds a lot of this side of things as well. So I mean  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:20):**  firstly and foremost I don't think you'll find very many farmers out there that are  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:24):**  not the first priority isn't to make more money. But they're also very much concerned  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:29):**  about creating products that are safe and clean and green and utilising the technology  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:33):**  to be able to do to be able to prove that to be able to make a case into the future  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:38):**  where everybody's so much more concerned about where the food comes from being able to say  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:42):**  okay well that's that's great that you want to know where it's come from and I can tell  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:45):**  you everything that's happened in this place. And that's a slow moving thing. It's not something  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:51):**  that's at great pace at the moment but it is something that growers are starting to  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:07:55):**  become more and more aware of. And I think definitely in that thought process of going  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:08:00):**  okay well you know it is something that I need to consider because I don't want to be  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:08:04):**  left with you know 200 tonne of wheat that I can't sell or 30 bales of cotton that nobody  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:08:10):**  wants to buy.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:08:11):**  I think the confidence point is really interesting. I'm curious how that plays out. Like do you  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:08:16):**  can you just tell right away when someone's like oh like you know I thought I had to hear  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:08:21):**  this presentation but I'm really not confident in using this or like can you kind of tell  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:08:24):**  right away how keen they're going to be or is it much more subtle in terms of like taking  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:08:29):**  them through a training or like just kind of how does that play out in practice?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:08:34):**  Every situation is different to be honest with you. I am in some you know very quickly  
**[0:08:40-0:08:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:08:40):**  I mean we don't try to tend to push things. We don't actively sell or anything and 95%  
**[0:08:48-0:08:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:08:48):**  of my business comes from people contacting me generally. So it's a slightly I guess it's  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:08:56):**  quite a different model straight up and when people tend to contact me sometimes it's out  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:09:01):**  of desperation. You know it's because it's incredibly dry and to be respectful somewhat  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:09:08):**  misguided thinking that if I kind of move into precision ag then I'm automatically going  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:09:12):**  to save on my input bill. You know I'm going to put less fertiliser out and I'm going to  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:09:16):**  make more money. That's just a common misconception that's out there. It might not always be so  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:09:20):**  blatant but it's a common misconception. And so dry weather and dry times when it hasn't  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:09:26):**  rained and this you know this need to put a crop in the ground but wanting to have the  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:09:32):**  least amount of risk up front is generally sometimes the driver that comes forward. And  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:09:37):**  then it kind of rains and people kind of blend back into the background and sort of go well  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:09:40):**  you know look I'm making money as it is there's no real need for me to change. But you know  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:09:46):**  the confidence I guess getting back to the question that you asked me being able to determine  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:09:51):**  that confidence level. Look some people will come and as soon as I sort of explain to them  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:09:55):**  it's not quite about saving money on fertiliser it's about robbing Peter to pay Paul and putting  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:10:00):**  it you know with that fertiliser where you can get the greatest bang for buck with it.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:10:05):**  People often say people sort of tend to draw back a little bit because all of a sudden  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:10:09):**  it's sort of like well what about that one in five year when I have all of that fertiliser  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:10:14):**  left over that's just kind of sitting there and it becomes abundant. And it's about convincing  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:10:18):**  people to think outside the square and that it's not that what they've done for the last  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:10:24):**  40 years is wrong because nothing is ever wrong. It's about sort of recognising that  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:10:28):**  it might not necessarily be a limitation but there's an opportunity there. And that takes  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:10:33):**  a long time and to be honest with you that's very much a people skill building process.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:10:39):**  It's about having that relationship with people, it's about going to the local footy field  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:10:43):**  and being there, being at the Christmas parties, being and so my life is filled with social  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:10:49):**  events as much as it is with actually talking to growers you know on a business level because  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:10:56):**  you know and I need to get to know their wife because she is the driver of the business  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:11:00):**  in the background and you know knowing their children and things like that. So it's very  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:11:05):**  much about becoming an integrated part of the community as much as it is about being  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:11:09):**  a successful consultant and being able to walk the walk and talk the talk. It's about  
**[0:11:14-0:11:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:11:14):**  having the people skills to negotiate. So the way in which people respond to me is different.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:11:21):**  Every person requires I guess a different way of engaging in them and over time especially  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:11:27):**  having that background working extension in no-till and control traffic as well has sort  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:11:32):**  of taught me a lot of really valuable skills on being able to recognise when somebody's  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:11:36):**  kind of living away from the conversation and taking a different tact and organising  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:11:42):**  my thoughts in a completely different way. And it's not necessarily about this hard sell  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:11:46):**  of you know getting everybody doing the same thing, it's more about generally they've always  
**[0:11:52-0:11:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:11:52):**  come to me. So it's about me you know I see it as a success when I've helped them to understand  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:11:59):**  what's going on in their farm, what their current limitations are and what they cost,  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:12:04):**  what they're costing the business and where the opportunities might exist. That's sort  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:12:08):**  of where the success story ends really, whether or not they kind of do anything with that  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:12:13):**  is not so much about me, it's about them. They have to be the one that chooses to go  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:12:19):**  forward and I don't necessarily look at it as a failure if they don't move forward because  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:12:24):**  there's a lot of other things that are at play aside from this just moving forward with  
**[0:12:29-0:12:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:12:29):**  technology. So yeah it's a really interesting job, like everybody's different, every day  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:12:36):**  is different.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:12:37):**  It sounds like one thing that I think is really interesting is the, you said like working  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:12:43):**  with start-ups and one thing that gets talked about in the start-up community is how relationship  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:12:48):**  based agriculture is, like exactly like you just said. So for a start-up that maybe doesn't  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:12:53):**  have the community or expertise or like boots on the ground where you are or is looking  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:12:59):**  to maybe even disrupt that and have things be more digitally based or sign up for something  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:13:04):**  online via an app. Like I don't know, what's your experience been working with the start-up  
**[0:13:08-0:13:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:13:08):**  community and do you see things moving more towards a digital space where you are still  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:13:15):**  based on relationships and community but everything's not done via like a face to face sale. For  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:13:20):**  example you might be buying things online or downloading an app to use a product.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:13:25):**  Yeah that's a really interesting question, not one that I probably am super confident  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:13:30):**  in answering really well. I guess it is really hard having worked with start-ups and creating  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:13:37):**  sort of these digital technologies that are about connecting information and bringing  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:13:43):**  information together and ultimately achieving some sort of a decision support tool that  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:13:49):**  ultimately will disrupt positions like mine I guess and my work colleagues like agronomists  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:13:55):**  and things like that. There's lots of questions about whether or not we will even have jobs  
**[0:13:59-0:14:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:13:59):**  in the future. So I mean I think that there will always be an impetus for growers to still  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:14:06):**  want to have relationships with people. Being a farmer is quite an isolating thing and you  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:14:11):**  know I guess over say take Moree for example when I first moved there we had 15,000 people  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:14:16):**  living in Moree. I think at the moment we've been down to 7,000 and the impact that that's  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:14:22):**  had on the community has been unimaginable. There are so many businesses that are closing  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:14:27):**  down and there's so many businesses that are on the brink of when we have water and there's  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:14:32):**  plenty of cotton in the ground they do well but they're not big enough businesses that  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:14:37):**  when we have a little bit of drought or we don't have a lot of water and the confidence  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:14:41):**  level or the outlook for the following season isn't fantastic they're the businesses that  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:14:45):**  tend to struggle and pack up and leave and then that affects the amount of kids in schools  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:14:50):**  and things like that. So every farmer I think is always very conscious about how technology  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:14:54):**  is going to impact and I don't think anybody knows the real answer but how it will potentially  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:14:59):**  impact not just the way that they do business but the community and the place that their  
**[0:15:04-0:15:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:15:04):**  local school land where they buy their local chemical from and their fertilizer from and  
**[0:15:11-0:15:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:15:11):**  creating more and more jobs. It's a really difficult question to answer. I don't doubt  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:15:19):**  for a minute that online shopping which plenty of people do in the bush we're not adverse  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:15:24):**  to buying things online, we do it plenty of times and utilising apps and technology to  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:15:30):**  create more efficiencies within business. Absolutely no doubt that people are not going  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:15:34):**  to do that. More and more farmers I guess are utilising seeking information from alternate  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:15:40):**  sources it's not about picking up the land or the rural newspaper anymore it's about  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:15:45):**  being on Twitter and being part of things like you know OzChat and things like that  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:15:51):**  to be sourcing information from. Twitter is a huge source of information for people and  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:15:56):**  I think the more that people feel comfortable getting information from digital sides of  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:16:00):**  things will transcend into more confidence in being able to trust remotely collected  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:16:06):**  data or remote sensing information. I think that the time is coming now that people are  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:16:12):**  feeling more confident with it but I think there's still a little way to go before they  
**[0:16:16-0:16:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:16:16):**  completely rely on a whole completely analysed digital decision support tool that ultimately  
**[0:16:25-0:16:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:16:25):**  says okay grow this crop here now, not tomorrow now and put this much here and that. I think  
**[0:16:33-0:16:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:16:33):**  that people like myself and agronomists and stuff like that, very few people are probably  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:16:40):**  utilising the technology themselves that can make how they do their job better to be honest  
**[0:16:46-0:16:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:16:46):**  with you. We had a really classic example at work a few months ago where we had a young  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:16:54):**  agronomist who had not long been in the business but really keen user of technology come straight  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:16:59):**  out of uni really being able to utilise all of these digital ag tools incredibly well  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:17:04):**  and you know users set them up on a regular basis, jumps on, had a look and for a cotton  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:17:10):**  field that he wasn't actually providing the agronomy service for but was being paid, a  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:17:16):**  private agronomist was being paid an incredible amount of money to look after that cotton  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:17:20):**  field but he just happened to notice that the inside wasn't doing as well as it probably  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:17:25):**  should be of a pivot and so he jumped the fence and it's not as though he wasn't allowed  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:17:30):**  to be on his property but he wasn't being paid to look after this cotton crop, jumped  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:17:34):**  the fence, walked all the way into the centre of the pivot and went oh the sprinklers aren't  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:17:38):**  turned on, whoops and they've been like that for quite a few weeks but you know the very  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:17:43):**  highly paid agronomist who has 25 years of experience looking after cotton because he  
**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:17:48):**  wasn't utilising tools like this and no one farmer expects an agronomist to walk every  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:17:54):**  hectare of every field but it's having that digital technology which is freely available  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:00):**  to everybody to just sort of go okay there's something going on in that just pure reflectance  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:06):**  map it's not going to tell me anything specific, it's not going to say it's a disease but there's  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:09):**  something going on there that requires a few you know set of boots in the field to really  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:14):**  kind of translate what's going on but it didn't happen by this you know well experienced guy  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:20):**  and you know it's one of those things that there's so much technology available to all  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:25):**  of our agronomists right now but so few of them are utilising them to help them do their  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:30):**  job better.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:31):**  Why do you think that is?  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:34):**  I think there's a couple of reasons, a little bit of ignorance, I won't deny that, there's  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:37):**  a bit of ignorance there and there's a little bit of apprehension about how these tools  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:43):**  are going to potentially replace them I think you know it's sort of like if I don't take  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:47):**  any notice of them then they don't really exist and I don't need to face them but I  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:51):**  think there's also to be fair to agronomists we're not all ignorant completely but to be  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:18:57):**  fair I think one of the greatest challenges for us is that most agronomists are already  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:19:04):**  so busy and they're looking after so many people and as you know farming is highly dynamic  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:19:10):**  so nothing is ever the same in each every week so they've got to be on their toes all  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:19:13):**  the time thinking about different things thinking about what it could be or what they should  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:19:17):**  be doing or what's the next crop and if I make this decision now how is it going to  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:19:22):**  impact the farmers choices for next year just say chickpea prices go you know rock bottom  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:19:28):**  and he changes that to wheat what's this decision going to do to impact that decision next year.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:19:34):**  So there's always a lot going on I think and they're always really busy thinking about  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:19:37):**  things and to have to think about something different in a different way is sometimes  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:19:42):**  just a bit of a I will I'll do that but I'll just do it next week you know because I'm  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:19:47):**  a little bit busy right now and then also to be fair as well I mean things like Saturn  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:19:52):**  Map as a tool which is just sentinel data pulled into a really nice easy to use platform  
**[0:19:56-0:20:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:19:56):**  but it requires another login and we've been working with the providers with software that  
**[0:20:03-0:20:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:03):**  we use which is Agworld to integrate this information in there and so it doesn't need  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:09):**  to be a be all and end all wholly successful you know providing a monumental amount of  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:15):**  analytics but it just needs to be in the same place that they do the recommendations because  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:19):**  they don't need to log out and log into something else that requires internet connection where  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:24):**  they don't have any then they're much more likely to be able to use it so just I think  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:30):**  just sometimes it's the simple things that can make such a big difference to an agronomist  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:35):**  utilizing that information and then he's showing his customer or his grow and saying hey I  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:40):**  check this out isn't this funky you know when you were planting the other day you said you  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:45):**  had problems with the seeder well this is what the impact is you know having all of  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:49):**  those levels of information at somebody's fingertips without the reliance on an internet  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:54):**  connection.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:55):**  It's funny people say that that's like a like that challenge gets brought up a lot and it's  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:20:59):**  not an ag one like this weekend I was working and I realized my Google Drive wasn't synced  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:04):**  up with my online Google Drive and so my files weren't syncing and I went to sign in and  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:09):**  then it needed a login and I didn't have it and then like it was just too many steps and  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:14):**  so I finally was like whatever I just won't sync it right and it's like that's not the  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:17):**  right answer the right answer is just like do the thing that will take 30 seconds to  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:20):**  get your files to sync but instead I was like ah it's too hard I can't be bothered and then  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:24):**  we sort of expect that other people are gonna do this extra work when like I'm pretty tech  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:28):**  savvy and I just I couldn't be bothered like I just wouldn't do it so I think it's kind  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:31):**  of funny that we sometimes we hold different groups to different standards but yeah that's  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:36):**  where the usability needs to come in like having you know the password manager hook  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:39):**  up to this and that and just kind of integrate all the systems will help a lot I think.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:44):**  Yeah absolutely I mean I think a lot of the the programs or the platforms that are being  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:50):**  used like there's probably three main ones here in Australia and we use Agworld and I'm  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:53):**  not advocating it's just the road that we went down and but you know they're making  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:21:59):**  some really big in-road steps to be to have all of our soil tests coming into one place  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:03):**  and having our yield data integrated into that obviously pre-processed so it's nice  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:07):**  and clean and usable but also having our you know satellite imagery not that we place a  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:13):**  huge amount of emphasis on satellite imagery but it's a really handy layer to have so having  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:18):**  all of these really useful information means that when a grower steps out in the or when  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:22):**  a grower steps out in the field be it with or without his grower or a grower is looking  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:27):**  at the same data when they go out into the field they have every bit of information that's  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:30):**  there when they're making a decision okay well should I be putting fertiliser on now  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:34):**  or not you know he's got some long range forecasts about what's going to happen you know he's  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:39):**  got some historical data around that field because he's got a weather station in there  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:42):**  and you know he's got all the information about previous soil tests and with locations  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:47):**  against them which is you know seems like an instant yeah very simple thing but the  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:52):**  amount of soil tests that are around with our within our business that do not have a  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:22:56):**  geotag with them is unbelievable but again it's one of those simple processes of okay  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:23:02):**  I need a program that allows me to pinpoint something that's going to fix that to my recommendation  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:23:08):**  you know based tools so you know I think the technology that we have around us is amazing  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:23:14):**  but there's this real disconnect on bringing it all together so that we can use it in a  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:23:20):**  really sensible way yeah I wanted to ask you so I know one of the startups you're working  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:23:24):**  with is Florissat and they use drones or you help them to collect a bit of drone data and  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:23:29):**  you mentioned drones before as something that you didn't think you'd be using but now are  
**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:23:34):**  so yeah maybe tell me a little bit about your journey with drones in particular and their  
**[0:23:38-0:23:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:23:38):**  technology that's had lots of hype around it and now lots of reality around it that  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:23:44):**  you're seeing as well so what's that been like okay so I guess I was always a little  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:23:48):**  skeptical of drones and and I'm to be realistic I probably look at myself as a little bit  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:23:54):**  of a glass half full kind of girl I tend to look at things with a lot of skepticism and  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:23:58):**  then it needs to kind of prove to me or I need to look at it and a bit and and it analytically  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:24:04):**  I guess to be able to then say okay you know what I think this is a worthwhile and I see  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:24:08):**  a plausible way how this could provide great information or it could provide a great solution  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:24:13):**  and I was always a little skeptical of drones but my my general manager is a really avid  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:24:19):**  pilot and was so keen he's just like Brooke find me a way that we can justify buying a  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:24:25):**  drone and I was like oh really okay are we going down this road so that's you know we  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:24:30):**  we went to a couple of workshops and we listened to you know things about drones and I was  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:24:35):**  still a little skeptical but Josh was like right we're getting into this drone thing  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:24:39):**  so we really just sort of started selling drones and it was quite by accident we decided  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:24:43):**  to get a few for our agros use them out the field see how practical they really were see  
**[0:24:49-0:24:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:24:49):**  how useful they were in terms of can we see more things at a greater height and I guess  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:24:56):**  more than anything how practical they really were and then a couple of our customers said  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:25:01):**  oh can you buy one for us or can you buy one for us and nearly three years down the track  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:25:05):**  we have sold over 600 drawings which is just I'm sure there's not even that many farmers  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:25:11):**  in the north of New South Wales but we have drones all over Australia now and it's crazy  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:25:15):**  so we've learned a lot about just simple you know things like a phantom just a really simple  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:25:20):**  little multi rotor people using them in very different ways no one's trying to save the  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:25:25):**  planet with them but using them just as a evaluating tool that or an extra set of eyes  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:25:29):**  in the sky and then obviously we were working with fluoresce and we purchased the big drone  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:25:36):**  that we call Lizzie which is just a matrice and we purchased that to run a whole heap  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:25:40):**  of sensors to help them with their development work and having come out the back end of that  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:25:45):**  we've now put Lizzie in the cupboard so Lizzie's been banished back to the big cupboard now  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:25:51):**  and I guess really we had a lot of issues and that put me off a lot I mean just simple  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:25:57):**  things admittedly there was nobody else in Australia at the time that was trying to run  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:26:01):**  three different sensors on a multi rotor platform and trying to power everything at once so  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:26:06):**  electronically we had a lot of serious issues going on and not a lot of people around to  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:26:12):**  help us go if you plug this in here and you plug this in here you're going to get abracadabra  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:26:17):**  everything's going to work because it was never quite that simple so I mean aside from  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:26:21):**  that and that's just an individual situation but one of the greatest issues that we found  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:26:26):**  with the drone was especially in a really large broad acu sense was the great it was  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:26:31):**  incredibly inefficient so and then all of the work that we did with them you know with  
**[0:26:35-0:26:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:26:35):**  with fluoresce that required flying under very specific circumstances which whenever  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:26:42):**  you're collecting remotely sensed information especially with a passive sensor that we were  
**[0:26:48-0:26:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:26:48):**  using required really nice good sunshine or complete cloud and we had 11 fields that we  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:26:55):**  were flying for fluoresce and roughly worked out to be about once every four weeks we were  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:27:01):**  supposed to fly well by the time we got through the first one we were about about three months  
**[0:27:07-0:27:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:27:07):**  behind schedule because it was either too windy or it was too cloudy or we just didn't  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:27:13):**  have enough hours in the day to get there and back again and not only that but at best  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:27:18):**  we were getting around 40 hectares which sounds like a reasonable amount but even these irrigation  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:27:23):**  fields the smallest field that we had was 120 hectares we were only collecting a third  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:27:27):**  of the data so by the time we would have collected all of that data it would have been probably  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:27:31):**  taken three days to do it all and that was multiple sets of batteries with charging hubs  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:27:37):**  and generators and everything that we could think of that would make our process easier  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:27:43):**  we used but unfortunately it was just the nature of the beast and then obviously putting  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:27:48):**  it on a different sort of drone wasn't an option we needed a fair bit of lift power  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:27:53):**  so a fixed wing was out of the equation and to cut a long story short like I said Liz  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:27:58):**  is in the shed and we've gone to a manned plane instead.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:02):**  Interesting and has that changed your view on drones?  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:08):**  Do you still think drones are useful but just that some of the technology has to develop  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:13):**  to enable some of these sensors or is it like what's your view on having actually worked  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:17):**  quite closely with these technologies now?  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:20):**  To be honest with you kind of going down the drone road and coming out the other end and  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:25):**  kind of moving away from drones has made me realise one thing and that a lot of people  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:29):**  are very very obsessed and really not obsessed but really excited by the drone itself and  
**[0:28:36-0:28:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:36):**  you know that's the big kid in all of us you know I don't know many people that don't ever  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:39):**  remember flying remote controlled helicopters and absolutely loving because there's this  
**[0:28:43-0:28:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:43):**  sense of being able to control something else but to be honest with you I guess the technology  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:51):**  will evolve it will continue to evolve there will be drones that will be able to do things  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:54):**  that we can't do now and that are they're unable to do right now or they're inefficient  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:28:59):**  at completing right now but to be honest with you I'm probably less excited about the actual  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:04):**  drone and more excited about what the the way in which people are thinking drones can  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:08):**  to deliver something so I gave a talk recently to a bunch of farmers who had asked me to  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:13):**  come and talk about drones thinking I'd go there and go oh blah blah and let's be super  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:19):**  excited about drones and I just kind of walked in said look I'm going to burst your bubble  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:23):**  right away and you know I'm not the biggest advocate of drones and this is why and this  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:27):**  was my experience and the biggest take home message that I said to these guys was be more  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:32):**  excited about the data itself because lots of them were kind of like can we could you  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:37):**  think there's potential to be able to measure pH from the sky using a drain is there ability  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:42):**  to venture measure different changes in soil type and what that could potentially mean  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:46):**  and I'm like you can do all of that now you don't need a drone to do that like and it's  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:50):**  so much more efficient to do it without a drone so you know people are excited about  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:55):**  all the things that they think drones can deliver but they need to forget about the  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:29:59):**  drone and be more excited about what it is that they think that is going to they're going  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:03):**  to get from that information because that's the serious game changer the drones just like  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:08):**  a tractor yeah at the end of the day I found the same thing that when you that some of  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:13):**  these technologies can either be exciting just because they're exciting technologies  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:17):**  or can be sort of scary because they seem far away or seem like useless and futuristic  
**[0:30:23-0:30:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:23):**  but once you get into the use case like once you're actually talking about oh it can measure  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:26):**  this or it could do that or we can hook this up to that then the conversation really flips  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:30):**  and you start to get into like a brainstorming solution excitement mode around oh well then  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:36):**  can we hook up to that and it's not to say that there aren't huge challenges but that  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:40):**  you can kind of change from just exciting in a toy kind of playing way or super skeptical  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:46):**  and into like oh this could be really valuable how do we think about solving problems and  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:50):**  I think that's where I'm seeing a lot more of that and I think that's really exciting  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:54):**  for the kind of future of precision ag and ag tech more broadly so I think that's really  
**[0:30:59-0:31:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:30:59):**  it's good to hear that you've experienced that as well.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:02):**  In terms of startups are you like what was it like to work with a startup because they're  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:07):**  different in terms of you know faster but also you know not fully established companies  
**[0:31:13-0:31:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:13):**  with products that already you know necessarily work all the time or exist you're obviously  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:16):**  doing a lot of testing and helping with development is like what's it been like for a company  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:20):**  like yours and for you to work with startups that really aren't you know like probably  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:26):**  other businesses that you've maybe experienced in terms of how big they are how fast they  
**[0:31:30-0:31:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:30):**  are what has that been like?  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:33):**  To be honest with you at the end of this cotton season you know very privately people sort  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:38):**  of say oh you know how's it been working with startups and I say it nearly killed me it  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:42):**  really did nearly kill me and not so much because of the actual working with startups  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:45):**  I think it was probably more the commercial development and trying to fast track something  
**[0:31:50-0:31:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:50):**  in the field on behalf of a company that you have no financial stake in you know trying  
**[0:31:56-0:32:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:31:56):**  to fast track R&D essentially in a non fast trackable way was really stressful and being  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:32:04):**  at the mercy of all the things that every farmer is at the mercy of environmental conditions  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:32:08):**  weather and all those things just never quite playing the way we wanted to so that was it  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:32:13):**  was a really kind of stressful situation I won't deny that but in terms of actually probably  
**[0:32:18-0:32:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:32:18):**  working with a startup you know there was plenty of times where you know I they would  
**[0:32:24-0:32:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:32:24):**  ask my opinion of something and I didn't always agree with their opinion and I didn't always  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:32:30):**  give them the answer that they wanted to hear and but that I think that's been a really  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:32:34):**  valuable exercise for everybody involved because I've sort of brought something completely  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:32:38):**  different to their business that they wouldn't have thought of which was the practicality  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:32:43):**  of doing things actually in the field and the practicality of how useful the information  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:32:48):**  that they're trying to develop could be but it needs to be considered around X, Y and  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:32:53):**  Z so I think you know I was able to bring them ground them a little bit and bring them  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:32:58):**  back to earth but then it sort of taught me a lot of other things as well it taught me  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:33:02):**  to probably appreciate a lot more how much effort goes into R&D and developing things  
**[0:33:08-0:33:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:33:08):**  for the future and irrespective of whatever comes of fluoro sat you know I've learnt a  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:33:16):**  lot and can take a lot back to the customer even if it isn't a finished product it's about  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:33:21):**  sort of thinking about things in a completely different way and it's about thinking outside  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:33:25):**  the square for a solution to every problem and that's something that I've gotten a lot  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:33:30):**  from working with a startup so much so that even though I you know two minutes ago I said  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:33:35):**  to you that nearly killed me but you know we're sort of on this journey now of okay  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:33:39):**  I would like to do more of that you know I really I'm really enjoying being able to be  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:33:44):**  at that at the core and the epicentre of things that are new and exciting and we really love  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:33:49):**  that and our customers love that we are part of something that is new whether or not it  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:33:54):**  eventuates into anything is almost irrelevant but being able to sort of offer that connect  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:01):**  between the farmer and the startup and being able to bring some perspective to them and  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:05):**  say actually that issue isn't so important to us but this is and at those very early  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:11):**  stages of the startup and being able to sort of help guide them and their you know their  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:16):**  enterprise to being something that's really tangible and really useful on the ground is  
**[0:34:20-0:34:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:20):**  kind of special.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:21):**  Yeah totally and I think ag tech need more people like that like need more translation  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:27):**  functions between the real requirements and the technologies and the technologies and  
**[0:34:31-0:34:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:31):**  the requirements and get that boots on the ground practical perspective and to your point  
**[0:34:36-0:34:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:36):**  before to get that kind of person embedded in the community that can help to tell the  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:42):**  story of where this is going and have that conversation over a longer period of time  
**[0:34:46-0:34:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:46):**  instead of you know coming and presenting at a conference and then leaving and hoping  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:50):**  they you know something happens it's just going to go a bit slower than that you have  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:53):**  to build up that trust and understand so I think that's a huge reason why it's so exciting  
**[0:34:58-0:35:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:34:58):**  that you're doing what you're doing I think it's so important.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:00):**  So if you're looking for other startups what kinds of startups would you be looking for  
**[0:35:06-0:35:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:06):**  like what's an area that's exciting?  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:08):**  Oh that's a really good question.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:12):**  Probably the thing that probably excites me the most in the ag tech space really is probably  
**[0:35:16-0:35:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:16):**  a little bit more in that midstream it's about sort of connecting all this information together  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:20):**  and creating helping girls to be able to create that provenance so you know that's where I'm  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:26):**  probably most excited at the moment having said that you know I'm working with other  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:31):**  startups that are very specific and a very specific product in you know in pastures for  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:37):**  example and it's not something that I know a lot about but I'm still you know I still  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:41):**  think that I can bring maybe not the agronomic knowledge but something else valuable to their  
**[0:35:45-0:35:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:45):**  business and you know McGregor Goolay where you know we only have 13 branches which is  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:51):**  probably fairly large for an agribusiness standard but in terms of trying to connect  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:35:55):**  with all of Australian farmers is you know we're very small fish in the sea but you know  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:00):**  we're part of a bigger group which is national and that's what we're trying to develop now  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:05):**  is we're trying to sort of get more and more people involved in businesses that are like  
**[0:36:10-0:36:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:10):**  ours that can offer a completely different perspective you know the planes Liverpool  
**[0:36:14-0:36:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:14):**  Plains is completely different to northern New South Wales and we're only 300 kilometres  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:20):**  apart and so you know if we can create more and more connect between businesses throughout  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:25):**  Australia and that ag tech space I think it could be really positive for everybody and  
**[0:36:31-0:36:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:31):**  of course you know there's going to be more and more people that are more interested in  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:34):**  one particular ag tech space than another but I guess you know getting back to your  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:38):**  question something that really ties everything together I'm probably less interested in the  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:44):**  big individual piece of information that you know will revolutionise everything and it's  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:49):**  not that you know fluoresce that's a great example that is a very specific product looking  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:53):**  at you know a nitrogen or a nutritional status of the plant at any given point in time but  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:36:58):**  you know that information by itself is not so exciting to me but that information as  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:37:03):**  part of a much bigger set of data it can be really really you know really influential  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:37:09):**  really valuable for a grower particularly in a system where you have all of that data  
**[0:37:14-0:37:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:37:14):**  in a platform all together where you can go in and sort of say okay well this is what  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:37:19):**  my nitrogen status is right now at this given point in time on this field but I also know  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:37:23):**  this part of the field doesn't perform so I'm making a much more informed decision about  
**[0:37:28-0:37:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:37:28):**  what to do with that and less about going you know okay my nitrogen is variable and  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:37:34):**  spinning out a variable rate map from that it's probably about you know putting that  
**[0:37:39-0:37:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:37:39):**  into context of how do I then turn that into something to make the best decision possible  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:37:45):**  so yeah I think that is where many at least of the startups I talked to really want to  
**[0:37:50-0:37:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:37:50):**  get to and there's it's been good to see an increased focus in the tech community on decision  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:37:55):**  making and decision support and connecting it to ROI and what's the so what here not  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:37:59):**  just maps or data for data's sake I think the reality of how we actually do that and  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:38:05):**  how these systems talk to each other and what the user experience is that's the part to  
**[0:38:09-0:38:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:38:09):**  still be sorted out but it's good to see everyone yeah we'll speak in the same language so and  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:38:16):**  that kind of comes back to what you actually say on your LinkedIn profile which I love  
**[0:38:20-0:38:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:38:20):**  which is around demystifying precision ag and this it's not just with farmers and talking  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:38:26):**  about the new tools and that precision ag isn't new it's just a new set of tools or  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:38:30):**  continually evolving set of tools but that it's also with the rest of the agribusiness  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:38:34):**  community too about how do we look at new tools and how do we work with new players  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357338#t=0:38:39):**  like startups or research organizations so I think that is super fantastic and thank

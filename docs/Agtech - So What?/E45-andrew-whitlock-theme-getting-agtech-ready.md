### Agtech - So What?  (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 06:34:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:00:11):**  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:00:16):**  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:00:21):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:00:26):**  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  
**[0:00:30-0:00:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:00:30):**  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Today's episode is the fourth and final in  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:00:47):**  our series on getting ag tech ready. This theme is produced in partnership with Decipher,  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:00:52):**  a precision agriculture solution that helps growers and agronomists make data-driven decisions.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:00:57):**  Check out episodes 40, 41, and 43 to hear more about getting ag tech ready. Today's  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:01:03):**  guest is Andrew Whitlock. Andrew is a farmer and the founder of a company called Precision  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:01:08):**  Agriculture. But before all that, Andrew worked as an agronomist and extension officer where  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:01:13):**  he learned a lot about the how, why, and when farmers adopt new technology. The farming  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:01:19):**  system was the heart of what my role was because I focused largely on understanding raised  
**[0:01:24-0:01:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:01:24):**  beds and helping farmers adopt raised bed technology in Southwest Victoria. That required  
**[0:01:30-0:01:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:01:30):**  a whole change in farming systems from just accepting that the country can get wet and  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:01:37):**  therefore limiting yield expectations and even the balance between cropping and pasture  
**[0:01:42-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:01:42):**  relative to those risks. That all changed when raised beds came along. I came a little  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:01:49):**  bit later after the initial start of the adoption of raised beds. But raised beds has been an  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:01:54):**  enormous benefit for farmers in Southwest Victoria. We've got heavy sodic soils and  
**[0:01:59-0:02:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:01:59):**  farmers have taken their yield, pushing or doubling what their yield averages are now  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:02:05):**  by just managing surface water. Andrew describes the raised bed system as being similar to  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:02:10):**  horticulture but just on broadacre. Helping farmers shift to this new system taught Andrew  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:02:15):**  a lot about adoption and what drives farmers to change behavior. He's also helped farmers  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:02:21):**  to start thinking differently about another system change known as controlled traffic  
**[0:02:25-0:02:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:02:25):**  farming. I was fortunate enough to spend eight months working with some consultants in understanding  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:02:33):**  the system behind controlled traffic and it's more just putting wheels, confining wheel  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:02:38):**  tracks but just the opportunity of how you can then harvest new water and the importance  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:02:43):**  of trying to get water into your soil. So then it led to the discussion around stubble  
**[0:02:47-0:02:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:02:47):**  and cover management, crop rotations and the like. So yeah it was really all around controlled  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:02:55):**  traffic and raised beds and the systems are falling behind that. While these systems are  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:02:59):**  more widely used today, for example in Australia adoption of controlled traffic is at around  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:03:04):**  30%. Andrew was working with them in the early days and says that adoption wasn't all that  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:03:09):**  smooth. Adoption of controlled traffic and raised  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:03:13):**  beds both had their challenges. You know like anything it's change and people are fearful  
**[0:03:18-0:03:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:03:18):**  of change. I mean it was more extreme in Queensland I think because the concept was the system  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:03:27):**  integrated this idea of running down slope so instead moving away from from contour banks  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:03:33):**  which is the way people been farming on slopes in southeast Queensland for a long time. And  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:03:38):**  so this new system came along with controlled traffic and not to go across the slope and  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:03:43):**  get rid of contour banks and go straight up and down the slope. And the critical thing  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:03:47):**  for making that work is that you had to maintain cover to improve the whole idea that we're  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:03:51):**  improving our soils, improving the ability for soil to infiltrate water and these heavy  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:03:56):**  storm events and then capture them in the subsoil to grow a crop of stored water and  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:04:02):**  it worked. You know and we've had examples where I was up in the air after some big storms  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:04:08):**  you know four or five inches in a day and flying over country where we were just seeing  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:04:13):**  water everywhere running big erosion events and then we'd fly over these handful of these  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:04:19):**  controlled traffic farming systems that had been going up and down the slope when everyone  
**[0:04:23-0:04:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:04:23):**  was saying you know you're going to destroy the country, you're going to exacerbate the  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:04:30):**  risk of soil erosion and these farms were you know very very little soil movement, not  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:04:36):**  a lot of concentration of water and it worked and we could see it from the air on the going  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:04:41):**  down. That's when it sort of clicked for me to realise that you know sometimes we need  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:04:47):**  to be brave and take on change and push back against the fear because the benefit on the  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:04:53):**  other side once you've seen it then the end of the challenge is trying to communicate  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:04:56):**  that and to encourage others to adopt and I think we still have got a long way to go  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:05:02):**  to improve levels of adoption. For some farmers who haven't seen what's possible, like Andrew  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:05:07):**  did by flying over all those properties, being brave might mean taking a leap of faith. But  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:05:12):**  what are these farmers who have taken the leap to adopt new technologies actually like?  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:05:17):**  I guess they're just naturally that typical adoption curve you know they're those guys  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:05:22):**  that are probably hungry and always on that edge looking to improve identifying constraints  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:05:27):**  and system wide warnings, that continual improvement attitude and obviously with a healthy dose  
**[0:05:31-0:05:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:05:31):**  of innovation in them. You know it wasn't necessarily an age thing, we found some of  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:05:39):**  the best adopters I've worked with were farmers towards the very end of their farming career,  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:05:43):**  others are you know young farmers that have come back, the more traditional sort of story  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:05:47):**  of the younger farmer coming back wanting to embrace new technology. So it's the full  
**[0:05:52-0:05:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:05:52):**  spectrum you know and I worked with lots of different groups of farmers actually that  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:05:55):**  was sort of a strategy that we employed in my role was to have a lot of different farmer  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:06:00):**  discussion groups. So really leveraging the peer-to-peer learning experience which we  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:06:05):**  know is the best way for farmers to learn and just trying to utilise those innovators  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:06:11):**  and literally just get on farm, visit you know hear from the words of these farmers  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:06:16):**  that we're doing and making these changes. And my role was sort of to facilitate those  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:06:22):**  discussions but to also just do a little bit of applied research with these farmers and  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:06:26):**  try and capture a little bit more data and some metrics around what's actually happening  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:06:30):**  on the farm. You know you're saying that you've got better water holding capacity but you  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:06:35):**  know can we measure those changes and so we did a little bit of work around that, measuring  
**[0:06:40-0:06:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:06:40):**  changes in soil, bulk densities, measuring infiltration rates and all the studies were  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:06:48):**  quite similar all over the country where we were you know wherever we drove wheels we  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:06:54):**  were limiting porosity in the soil and that had a whole flow on effect to how the plant  
**[0:07:00-0:07:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:07:00):**  grew and a less robust plant, less tillers, lower yield in the order of 10-15% as it sort  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:07:07):**  of averages out. So that was sort of a story trying to just let the farmers learn from  
**[0:07:13-0:07:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:07:13):**  one another as much as we could.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:07:14):**  I think it gets talked a lot about the we need to collect the data and really show that  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:07:19):**  it's working and you know bring people out and give them the evidence of what's going  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:07:22):**  on but I imagine like reading 17 research papers on the data around the soil porosity  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:07:28):**  like that's not very compelling and so what's the like how does it actually work to kind  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:07:32):**  of show the results and is it a conversation, is it a series of conversations, is it a  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:07:37):**  demo farm like how does that actually work?  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:07:40):**  Farmers need to see it from other farms, I'm sure so that's field days but it's also more  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:07:46):**  than that I think it says that we need to hear it from a range of different sources  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:07:49):**  and a number of times we need to experience it in different ways so it might be you know  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:07:54):**  podcasts like this getting people talking about it right through to traveling and visiting  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:07:58):**  new to state and visiting farmers who are who are adopting these technologies that you're  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:08:02):**  looking at doing conferences is the other big one you know when I one of the things  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:08:07):**  that I organized was the Control Company Farming Association we kicked that off and we really  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:08:14):**  leveraged that idea around farmers presenting at a conference.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:08:18):**  We have these conferences every few years the Australian Control Company Farming Association  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:08:22):**  and the whole aim was getting farmers from all over Australia and from different industries  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:08:27):**  all talking about this concept of confining wheel tracks and that was a really powerful  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:08:31):**  process of adoption because people could see it working in a range of different environments  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:08:36):**  and it was the key word I think here is you've just got to get trust that what you're going  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:08:41):**  to implement stacks up and it's you've heard it and it's reliable and it's been proven  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:08:45):**  in a range of different environments ideally even in different technologies in different  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:08:50):**  farming context so you know horticulture, irrigated agriculture, broadacre, the concept  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:08:55):**  sound you know there's that real fear of not wanting to look silly when you adopt something  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:08:59):**  new and change and the economic risk of it so that was a really powerful avenue as well  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:09:04):**  the conferences but all the group activities we did were very small groups so there was  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:09:08):**  sort of no more than 15 to 20 farmers in a group and a lot of conversation a lot of thinking  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:09:13):**  they drove the research questions that they wanted to see answered and just really the  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:09:18):**  genuine engagement with the farmers and working them through any barriers that they saw adopted  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:09:24):**  helping them hold their hand to step over those barriers and it's slow and it's tedious  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:09:29):**  and it's expensive for governments and organizations to do this but we know if you want to get  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:09:34):**  practice change you have to it has to be a hands-on slow deliberate approach it's not  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:09:39):**  just going to be read a paper and all these farmers are going to adopt.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:09:43):**  And it's not just the government who misunderstands the thought processes of farmers.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:09:47):**  Ag tech companies sometimes get this wrong too which causes many problems including great  
**[0:09:52-0:09:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:09:52):**  ideas and products not being adopted.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:09:55):**  People are coming up with great ideas developing technology putting it to the market and it's  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:10:00):**  not getting a lot of traction and people are underestimating how complex and how much work  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:10:06):**  is required for a farmer the farming community to significantly adopt new technologies and  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:10:11):**  new processes.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:10:12):**  One of the things you said before Andrew was around identifying constraints and you talked  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:10:17):**  a little bit about that or I don't know if you have an example of kind of what that looks  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:10:20):**  like because I feel like that might be a practical tip for someone who's thinking about you know  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:10:25):**  making a change kind of like how should they think about identifying their constraints.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:10:29):**  I must say that most of my experience working with farmers in this space, geographical area  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:10:35):**  is southern New South Wales, Victoria, southeast South Australia and Tasmania so I'm sort of  
**[0:10:41-0:10:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:10:41):**  in that higher to medium rainfall areas land prices are high farmers are focused on most  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:10:51):**  farmers are focused on maximising yield and trying to identify constraints to yield.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:10:56):**  I'm happy to invest in strategies to unlock yield potential which is quite a different  
**[0:11:02-0:11:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:11:02):**  approach to farmers in more marginal areas which may initial the default position will  
**[0:11:09-0:11:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:11:09):**  be to manage cost and risk.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:11:11):**  So I just need to phrase that first.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:11:15):**  The key is to identify what are the key limiting constraints on your farm and then write that  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:11:21):**  down to an individual a paddock basis and the topics are consistent from farms from  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:11:27):**  Dubbo down to Devonport.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:11:29):**  There's typically a range of key soil constraints which are limiting your potential and for  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:11:36):**  me it's you know we have to start with our soils.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:11:39):**  You've got to want to be informed so you're seeking out information.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:11:43):**  I've had the luxury of working with a lot of soil scientists and I understand a lot  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:11:46):**  of the basics of soil science and I think the good farmers they're going to conferences  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:11:51):**  and they're building their skill levels up they've got that appreciation that soil health  
**[0:11:56-0:11:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:11:56):**  drives productivity of the farm.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:11:58):**  It's about understanding what is limiting yield and farmers kind of know that they know  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:12:06):**  their paddocks better than anyone.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:12:08):**  Often when I go and have worked on farms you know in some ways the farmers can tell you  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:12:12):**  straight off the bat what the strategies need to be, what the key constraints are.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:12:16):**  It's just that we need some extra data then to define the spatial patterns of those constraints  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:12:23):**  and then be able to develop a variable age strategy for it.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:12:26):**  But the farmers know, they'll know what country they're sitting in, where they get wet and  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:12:31):**  where they've got the heavy soils and where their sandy soils lie.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:12:34):**  Farmers know all that intuitively anyway.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:12:38):**  It's a matter of then just joining the dots and collecting some more data through the  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:12:42):**  process and then spitting out in the end a solution.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:12:46):**  The key with all this is identifying the problem that you're trying to address and being very  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:12:51):**  clear on what strategies you want to do first and not trying, you can't do everything at  
**[0:12:56-0:12:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:12:56):**  once.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:12:57):**  Andrew believes that farmers need to find a balance between using their knowledge of  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:13:00):**  the land and using tools to interpret data to make better decisions.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:13:05):**  But how much data is enough?  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:13:07):**  We're always taught we want to get as much data as we can and try and understand all  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:13:11):**  these complex patterns and all the correlations between all these maps we're generating.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:13:16):**  But there's been a lot of soil science and farming science that's gone on for a long  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:13:19):**  time here in Australia and people love just to throw that out and start new.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:13:23):**  We've got this new tech, this is better than all the science, the proven science.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:13:27):**  You have to respect the science and understand what constraint you're dealing with, what  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:13:34):**  are the critical measurements we need to understand that constraint.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:13:39):**  And you don't have to throw as much data as you possibly can to try and get a better outcome.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:13:43):**  It's just using the right data for the right solutions.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:13:46):**  And when it comes to implementing the tech that provides those solutions, Andrew says  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:13:50):**  that there is still hesitance among some farmers.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:13:53):**  There's a real adoption issue at the moment, I believe.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:13:57):**  It's about trust and it's about having a conversation with a farmer and for them to feel comfortable  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:14:02):**  and that the advice that they're getting from their advisor is sound and that they're happy  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:14:09):**  to act on that.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:14:11):**  The challenge is that there just aren't people out there doing that though.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:14:13):**  There are very few experienced precision ag advisors in the country sitting at coffee  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:14:17):**  tables with farmers discussing these strategies and how to build a precision ag implementation  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:14:22):**  plan for their farm that makes sense and it won't overwhelm them and will be continually  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:14:27):**  measured to make sure that the investment is sound and it just moves forward.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:14:32):**  When I look at a lot of the technology, a lot of the companies now hitting the marketplace,  
**[0:14:36-0:14:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:14:36):**  they're geared around the technology rather than around a process or a real want to improve  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:14:46):**  the customer's bottom line.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:14:48):**  I know from the very start we've always said in precision ag, our precision ag business  
**[0:14:52-0:15:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:14:52):**  is we have to focus on the customer and we want to remain technology agnostic.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:00):**  We don't want to get caught up in just delivering solutions that are limited by the one or two  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:06):**  bits of technology that our business could afford to invest in.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:09):**  We've tried to remain quite open minded and with that it's largely meant that we've stayed  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:16):**  very close to just proven science.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:20):**  Rubbish in, rubbish out is the key issue I think.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:23):**  We're flooded by poor quality data and people are grappling to try and make some sense of  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:27):**  it and that is getting lost in the whole journey.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:30):**  It almost makes it worse, right?  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:31):**  That it kind of makes you less excited to give it a go next time when you got burned  
**[0:15:36-0:15:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:36):**  the first time.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:37):**  I'm sensing a lot of that kind of fatigue or frustration of like, I don't want to do  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:41):**  this again.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:42):**  It was so painful last time.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:44):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:46):**  That's right.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:47):**  We're all time poor.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:49):**  We know that and that's not going to change.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:52):**  We need turnkey solutions delivered for us.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:15:55):**  So when we're working with a new customer, for example, you have to commit to walking  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:01):**  them through the whole process right from setting the implementation plan to generating  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:07):**  initial maps, drawing the insight data of those maps, but then right into the point  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:11):**  of literally loading the file, the prescription file onto the controller, sitting with the  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:16):**  farmer while they're doing their first few laps to make sure it's working properly and  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:19):**  they're comfortable with the journey.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:21):**  And it's a big investment.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:23):**  But once farmers have got through that, they've had that win, they understand, oh, well, I  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:27):**  can unzip a file and I can load that prescription file and it is going to work.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:31):**  And I do have someone I can call back on if there are issues, then I'm happy to proceed  
**[0:16:36-0:16:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:36):**  with this and maybe start looking at some other strategies.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:39):**  My parents were small business owners and I've just had a love of small business and  
**[0:16:43-0:16:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:43):**  a real passion for working with farmers.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:45):**  I've been blessed to have had that passion from a very young age and I've known forever  
**[0:16:50-0:16:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:50):**  that I've wanted to work with farmers.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:51):**  So that's just something I've been lucky to identify.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:54):**  It was just a leap of faith.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:16:55):**  I just left the government after seven years knowing I just wanted to go and start up a  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:17:00):**  small business.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:17:01):**  And I started just working under my own business, my own Whitlock Ag Services and was doing  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:17:07):**  some research and working with some individual customers.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:17:11):**  And then Tim Neil up in Queensland and I decided to come together and we started working collaboratively  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:17:17):**  and that journey sort of grew into where the business is today.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:17:21):**  Tim and I had some investors enter the company about four or five years ago and the company  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:17:28):**  has sort of taken a step change in the rate of growth as a company and we're now sitting  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:17:32):**  as one of the largest precision ag sort of adoption companies in the country and something  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:17:37):**  I'm really proud of.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:17:38):**  Were you married at the time when you decided to quit your job and take this leap?  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:17:42):**  We were about to be married so I was engaged and I wasn't farming at that stage.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:17:47):**  So a couple of years into starting this small business we also took on the opportunity of  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:17:52):**  doing some share farming with Sophie's family which was an opportunity that came possibly  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:17:56):**  a little bit sooner than we were maybe even ready for.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:17:59):**  So it was a pretty busy time and then small children entered the frame.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:18:03):**  So it was a crazy time looking back and there were quite a few years where you're working  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:18:09):**  every single day of the year but that's what it takes to start a small business.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:18:14):**  And as I spoke about earlier, working with farmers and in this practice change industry  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:18:19):**  it's costly and it's time-consuming and you have to be accessible and it's a lot of weekend  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:18:25):**  work and after hours work because you're working with farmers and farmers work all the time.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:18:30):**  So as a service provider you have to match that to get some credibility and to grow a  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:18:36):**  business.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:18:37):**  So yeah it was busy but I loved it, loved every moment of it.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:18:39):**  I worked with some tremendous scientists around the country, a lot of different farming systems  
**[0:18:44-0:18:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:18:44):**  groups, all the ag extension groups in these geographies, just tremendous people all having  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:18:51):**  a great time.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:18:52):**  Seeing the change at the farmer level though is the ultimate.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:18:55):**  Sitting there at the kitchen table with a farming family and them talking about the  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:19:01):**  economic benefits that they've gained from the strategies that we've developed and implemented  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:19:05):**  that's where it all hits home and it's really satisfying.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:19:11):**  Do you have a favorite story or example of a journey that you've taken a farmer on or  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:19:17):**  an impact that you've had that really stands out as like, oh yeah this is really why I  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:19:21):**  do it.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:19:22):**  Any kind of key stories stand out in your mind about that journey?  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:19:25):**  I deliberately try and keep things simple and I always have and I've always felt when  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:19:31):**  I first was learning about precision ag this just seems too complex.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:19:34):**  There's something wrong in the messaging here and I suppose some of the best stories are  
**[0:19:38-0:19:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:19:38):**  those that I recall, those where we have deliberately simplified things had a really good outcome.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:19:45):**  Drainage is a good example where people often think that it's expensive and it's complex  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:19:51):**  and it's going to make a mess in the paddocks.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:19:53):**  But I love the times when we've looked at paddocks and we've literally just changed  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:19:59):**  the direction that the tractors are driving in which the dropping perpendicular to the  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:04):**  flow of water has been holding the water up, allowing it to concentrate and then blowing  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:09):**  it into these big water log patches.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:12):**  Literally just turning those tracts around and running up and down the slope.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:16):**  I love when farmers still talk about that every now and then.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:19):**  There's a farmer over at New Lake Bolac where we did exactly this and he was delivering  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:24):**  me the next year and he couldn't believe what the benefit it was because often we'll say  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:28):**  let's just start by changing the direction and we'll see how we go.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:31):**  We have to put some drains in and we'll do that but I think that's going to make a huge  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:34):**  impact and when it comes through and it does and they don't need to put drains in, they've  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:38):**  really spent no money at all to get a really good outcome.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:40):**  I love that because that's the philosophy that we're trying to implement.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:44):**  So that's a good story.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:46):**  How do you reconcile that with running a business?  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:49):**  It's the right thing for the customer but I imagine you can't charge very much for that  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:53):**  advice.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:54):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:55):**  Yeah, very good question.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:57):**  Maybe I'm not the best business person.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:20:59):**  I don't know what that means but it's not a show when I say I'm focused on the customer.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:21:04):**  I'm a farmer now.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:21:06):**  My family have always worked for farmers.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:21:09):**  I understand how tight the margins are in farming.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:21:13):**  I think you've just got to realise that you've got to give something up to earn respect and  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:21:18):**  to build trust with people and marketing and breaking into new industries and building  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:21:23):**  a reputation for nothing.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:21:25):**  You just have in my mind that's just how you have to do it.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:21:28):**  What strikes me is the longer term view on it that it's not about making money now but  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:21:32):**  it's about building that relationship and adding value over time.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:21:36):**  That might not mean a transaction now.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:21:38):**  It might mean just adding value now and getting an opportunity to add value later again and  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:21:43):**  that that's the sustainability aspect of the business, not just the transactional aspect.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:21:49):**  Precision agriculture is about solving problems.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:21:52):**  You knock one on the head and then one more will pop up.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:21:55):**  It's just a continuum.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:21:56):**  It's not a transaction, it's a real journey.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:01):**  If you've got a strong relationship, I've always respected the relationship as well  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:04):**  working with farmers.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:05):**  You're entering their home, it's not just a business, it's a family.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:08):**  It's their home that you're sitting in and it's an honour.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:11):**  I've always found it an honour to come into a farming business and work with them at a  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:15):**  business level but with the whole family.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:18):**  You get to know their children.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:21):**  It's a different experience.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:23):**  It's not just business to business.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:25):**  There's a farmer down near Inverlie who has just been a fantastic farmer that we've worked  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:32):**  with and full of energy and always wanting to try new things.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:36):**  This is where I suppose the innovation comes in.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:39):**  We're always trying to look at what the next solution could be and are there some different  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:44):**  ways of measuring this information.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:48):**  Farmers like Josh down in Inverlie have supported this leap of faith.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:54):**  A farmer taking a leap of faith, putting some dollars on the line to invest in some new  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:58):**  ideas.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:22:59):**  You have to have someone try it.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:23:02):**  We would often try things by getting projects up and running but every now and then you  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:23:06):**  can't do that and you've relied on the farmer dipping that in their pocket.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:23:11):**  Josh is one.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:23:12):**  Josh down at Murnong, they're one example where they had faith in our process and they  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:23:17):**  were happy to invest and give us a go of trying new strategies.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:23:21):**  We did a whole range of different things of utilising yield data and understanding where  
**[0:23:26-0:23:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:23:26):**  on the farm they might be better.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:23:27):**  Just put the country back to pasture versus cropping.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:23:31):**  We did a lot of work on surface water management on there which has changed the way that farm  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:23:35):**  performs.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:23:36):**  We did a lot of work around understanding soils and where the constraints may lie and  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:23:40):**  always constantly challenging what the norm would be.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:23:44):**  Heavy country needs dips and does it really.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:23:46):**  So a lot of work with soil pits.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:23:50):**  One of the really powerful things I see with Precision Ag is we're collecting data on our  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:23:55):**  soil and understanding our soil landscapes a lot better and it's bringing soil testing  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:24:00):**  back to life because this idea of taking a soil test and a transect across a paddock,  
**[0:24:06-0:24:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:24:06):**  it's just flawed.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:24:08):**  We've got too much variability within paddocks for that to offer a meaningful result.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:24:15):**  We've done a heap of work and I love it when the farmers like Josh really embrace that  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:24:22):**  and would be constantly pushing us saying, okay we can go and split that up into two  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:24:27):**  or three or four zones and do some soil tests.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:24:29):**  What if we do some pits?  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:24:30):**  Let's go and look further down the profile and we'll get the excavator out and we'll  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:24:34):**  dig them and you'll leave the meeting and you'll ring the next day and say, right the  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:24:38):**  pits are open when you're coming back.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:24:39):**  Those sort of experiences never leave you.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:24:40):**  Working with those sort of farmers and they're out there, they're everywhere, those farmers.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:24:47):**  You've just got to identify who they are and just partner with them, really look after  
**[0:24:52-0:24:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:24:52):**  them and together you'll identify some innovations and new processes and new ways of improving  
**[0:24:59-0:25:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:24:59):**  profitability on farms.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:25:01):**  I'd be not doing my job in the kind of ag tech space if I didn't ask you about how you can  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:25:04):**  see this changing with things like satellite imagery getting so much better and new technologies  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:25:10):**  that might mean we can do that level of analysis and do that rigor around science but in new  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:25:16):**  ways.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:25:18):**  How do you see that changing the relationship and the process and maybe even the farming  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:25:24):**  system?  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:25:25):**  As I said before, we have to respect the science and as long as the new processes coming in  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:25:29):**  can complement and maintain a standard and it's accurate and it's being trialled and  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:25:36):**  tested then we're all for it.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:25:39):**  We know the adoption of what we're working with, variable rate applications.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:25:44):**  Adoption levels are so low.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:25:45):**  We're talking 15, 20% at best on strategies.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:25:49):**  It just makes so much sense that we're not getting cut through.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:25:54):**  Clearly price is a barrier.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:25:56):**  If technology can simplify, if we can see sensors automatically capturing this soil  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:26:02):**  data as we're sowing our crops and if that means then those strategies are going to be  
**[0:26:08-0:26:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:26:08):**  implemented more quickly because it's reduced the cost by 50% then I'm all for that because  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:26:15):**  we're just playing around the edges at the moment and that's what the technology will  
**[0:26:18-0:26:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:26:18):**  do.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:26:19):**  In reducing costs of lab tests that's going to be pretty exciting.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:26:23):**  I don't think it's going to be in the near future where we're going to be moving away  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:26:28):**  from using laboratories and more traditional measurement methods but I think there will  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:26:34):**  be a transition into these new techs and it's going to complement and there might be a ratio  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:26:39):**  of every 10th sample we send off to a lab that we can use these sensors.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:26:43):**  As long as we're testing, calibrating and making sure, I do feel people racing off and  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:26:49):**  collecting a lot of information of low quality data and delivery strategies for it.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:26:54):**  It's happening now and I really do worry because I guess I've just seen it and I'm a little  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:26:59):**  bit of a purist but I love lab quality data and measuring it on grids and that's what  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:27:05):**  I've based a lot of our strategies off now and I guess it's way more expensive but it's  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:27:09):**  accurate and like I spoke before it's an honour to work with farmers and I take it very seriously  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:27:14):**  when we change the rate of fertiliser from 100 to 150 kilos and it switches that line  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:27:19):**  in the peak right there.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:27:20):**  How confident are we with that line and yes there's always, you're never 100% confident  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:27:25):**  but I want to use the best quality data I possibly can to build those prescription maps  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:27:30):**  and it's to save a few dollars to generate those maps in the short term with poor quality  
**[0:27:35-0:27:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:27:35):**  sensor data.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:27:36):**  That's an expensive operation because you've got it wrong so I'm torn between this idea  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:27:41):**  of wanting to do it right and wanting to do it a little bit cheaper through advanced technology  
**[0:27:46-0:27:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:27:46):**  so my comment will always be just trial it, test it, question it, if it holds up and it  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:27:52):**  works well against traditional science and proven science, happy days and I can't wait  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:27:57):**  for those days because then we're going to see adoption go well beyond just these early  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:28:01):**  adopters and we really want to get into that early majority of farmers, the big swag of  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:28:06):**  farmers, 30 odd percent of farmers through there that they're ready, they're looking,  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:28:10):**  they're on the step, they're not quite getting there and perhaps technology is going to be  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:28:14):**  a way of really helping those farmers come on board and start implementing some more  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:28:18):**  precision ag in their business.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:28:20):**  Love it Andrew, super helpful, some really really good insights there both for the ag  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=395368#t=0:28:24):**  tech community and for farmers looking to go on the journey to get ag tech ready so

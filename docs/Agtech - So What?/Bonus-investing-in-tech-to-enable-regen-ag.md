### Agtech - So What?  (2021-10-28)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to a bonus episode of Ag Tech So What, brought to you by the Agthentic  Group.  I'm Kirsten Deprose.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:00:10):**  If regenerative agriculture is going to scale, it needs to be enabled by tech right across  the supply chain.  In this episode, you'll hear from a panel of venture investors, including Sarah Nollett,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:00:22):**  who of course usually hosts this podcast.  They'll speak about the role of venture capital in Regen Ag, why the investment cycles are  longer and what drivers are more likely to push companies to source from Regen Ag farmers.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:00:36):**  This panel was recorded at a recent Regenerative Food Systems Investment Forum in Oakland,  California.  And leading the panel discussion is Paul Lightfoot, the president and founder of Bright Farms.  
**[0:00:48-0:01:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:00:48):**  So I'll let him take it from here.  Paul Lightfoot, CEO of Bright Farms, is a company that sells grain and produce at retail  with the disruptors of piping that's more sustainable.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:01:05):**  We raise a lot of different kinds of capital, probably every kind of capital that was in  the public raised to $200, sold that company earlier this year.  We're seemingly a chance to work on what I'm putting in particular.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:01:17):**  We focus our career on the first economic thing with the green system.  And I want to do it largely by helping entrepreneurs build grain from the after-use and supply  chains instead of carbon and fuel.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:01:30):**  They're negative.  It's fun to be up here with these guys.  They're making those investments.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:01:34):**  So we're going to start with these two of our panelists introducing themselves.  We turn them into a rest.  Yes, they're going to come up.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:01:42):**  Our newest trailer is Capital.  We invest in CNC, HNC, and other agriculture companies.  Our success is quite great.  
**[0:01:52-0:02:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:01:52):**  We're looking for quality hardware, supply chain, and new services, flexibility in software,  investments, all the way to the consumer.  Our three T's are being innovative in technology, for example steel, and they'll take us all  
**[0:02:08-0:02:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:02:08):**  through the crisis and the operations.  I think cereal is an excellent way to start manufacturing.  That was a fun one.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:02:18):**  It was very good.  Just kidding.  I'm Sarah Deletch.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:02:23):**  I think I've gone on to talk to the competitors.  We are a series of same-stage investors in agriculture companies.  We look all along this budget as well, and everything we do has a focus around helping  
**[0:02:35-0:02:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:02:35):**  to make sure that we transition to a better control and communicate resilience for better  future.  A couple things that I think about us were based in Australia.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:02:44):**  This is me running on the executive editor for DevCon there.  We do a lot around building the ecosystem, so creating content, bringing people together,  knowing that change isn't just about the investment, all of the debate, but also the broader ecosystem  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:02:57):**  with the crisis.  We also use the core social security.  We invest in new hardware as well, and we've been that type of focus.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:04):**  It's really important for us to be writing to our partners in this space.  We don't have a set up in New Zealand, but of our first nine investments, we know there's  a goal going into it.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:14):**  So we're super excited about that, and think that it's what our own new world would have  been if it were in the job already.  Okay.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:22):**  Really personally, with the major initiatives we have, I call the funds that I manage,  and I think that is important, so I work as a service for the American Energy, who has  done research on this data and practices that we know will help build.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:42):**  While it isn't a one-size-fits-all, there are some practices that have been scientifically  proven to build this data, and so what we look to do is invest in those companies that  are one of our whole team to help the practices, all of them that will help come out of their  
**[0:03:59-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:59):**  box are a lot of fun, how are we actually implementing these practices at scale.  And so it's very nice to have a company like this that's really type 5.  Yeah, it's great to be here.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:11):**  Great, thanks so much.  So, what do you say we do?  So, you are saying that it is big enough, but it's a big opportunity.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:19):**  One of the problems in America is that we've seen everything through very conservative  elections.  I'd love to hear other agencies inspired by things that are different, and have become  
**[0:04:31-0:04:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:31):**  so consistent, it's not hard to be in front of the other agencies as they're saying this.  What do they learn in Australia?  We think we should be thinking about right here, the many reasons that stories are invested  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:44):**  in the American business sector.  Some of the students are really  definitely become science students, and they keep learning.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:50):**  Yeah, so it is a fascinating place.  When I moved there six years ago, it's a big deal for South hockey.  I wish I could really say that I picked Australia on a map, and we did a couple of basketball  
**[0:04:59-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:59):**  games, and there was an accidental, where as the people standing up there, Australia  is a great agriculture, tons of different  So, very low subsidies, farmers really innovated, highly adopting the technology, and it's a  
**[0:05:12-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:12):**  great ag economy.  There's also great ag and local research, and there's a hundred trillions of dollars  going into ag increases every year, and that's a big part of the subsidy.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:20):**  It's very likely that it's mostly in the inputs, and it's really a big part of the ecosystem  and from the same ag and agriculture that's been involved really well.  And I guess what I learned from that is basically the ecosystem approach.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:31):**  How do we bring in the corporates?  How do we involve farmers?  How do we not come at ag tech from the Silicon Valley only trial?  
**[0:05:38-0:05:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:38):**  How do we instead bring the best practices of Silicon Valley to agriculture and agriculture?  And I'm also a major, taking a second role, and so that's where we try to focus.  It's not just trying to compete, but actually embrace who was and who did agriculture.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:54):**  It's exactly the same point.  One thing Americans can probably learn is just to be more open-minded to each other's  geographies and what you might learn from them.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:02):**  We see a lot of ag tech companies wanting to be in commerce, it's not just saying, you  know, this is not the southern hemisphere.  We see them wanting to work with the farmers because they are adopting some technology  
**[0:06:11-0:06:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:11):**  so for investors, speaking about mine, I think the benefit is that I want to give you two  hard, innovative insights.  And we can happily redirect as well in this episode?  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:20):**  Yes, it's three of our first nine investment insights in the US.  We're in a bad hole, continuing for a venture in the on-techs in the US.  Okay.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:27):**  Renee, you're next.  I'm next.  Yesterday, we heard some people say that this is the sector that we believe in.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:33):**  We believe in basic capital.  I don't know if that's true or not, but you know we're taking a piece of the paper, starting  with the title, it stands like entirely basic, idea, basically.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:44):**  Do you think that the second, more basic, term, how do you be invested in burning down?  Yes, it is.  It is more basic capital.  
**[0:06:53-0:07:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:53):**  One of the things it's ended for is just biology, right?  Like what we're working in is biological systems.  I was in John  
**[0:07:09-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:07:09):**  Kennedy's office, and I was a junior team back there.  We were interested in health resources.  We were able to make health patients in a box, right?  
**[0:07:16-0:07:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:07:16):**  And so the development cycles are so, that's just the reality.  You have to wait for a bi-system to come around.  You can't just simulate bi-systems and then to test new technologies.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:07:27):**  So there's just the reality of the system that we're in.  You know, people buy the mobility, you have to do some really important testing solutions.  And there's also this reality that it's quite of that critical importance to get all of the human beings.  
**[0:07:43-0:08:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:07:43):**  There's actually not as much money being added to our track.  And so you don't have this activity cycle and money flow that you haven't come up with or seen.  So it's really these dynamics that we need more AC capital and more people to actually develop solutions that will drive change on time.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:08:07):**  And even in the rest of the world, are you going to have to pick up a lot more equipment for the future?  We have to power really late in this world.  We actually don't have non-concessors.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:08:19):**  And we're actually making other venture-based products.  And so we are actually like super capable of doing this.  But the reality is that if you build a venture, these people are not out of five percent of the cycle.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:08:34):**  The reality is they're all accepting.  It's much longer than the title.  The tech leaders just said yes because the tech-based market is so hard to do next.  
**[0:08:44-0:09:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:08:44):**  And yesterday morning, around the same time that people were talking about the new space,  I also heard some people on this stage say that a sort of 20 percent carry model,  would even be the right model for this case that perhaps it's an explanatory or an extracted model that looks none the sector.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:09:05):**  But when you look here, you know, and I thought this morning, as we looked at the high truck up on the screen that's there,  we're going to need a whole lot of capital in order to take the world, and this is what we're going to need to do for the world.  You know, we have a case to fill a model.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:09:20):**  And it's like, do you agree that that model is for here, in real case, equally?  What's he doing?  We thought, you know, we might have an argument with the models and, you know,  
**[0:09:31-0:09:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:09:31):**  could we make a video about how the servers are providing the real or fighting time for kind of outside of the environment,  and sort of the one that you guys do, you know, some of our best team operators did to the executive.  Just in the past, our reach here outside the room was to keep them on the front page,  
**[0:09:49-0:10:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:09:49):**  which is a very easy message, and we also have a scenario where people can just say,  yeah, we get the good money.  We are still here, I thought, because we're in the school, we're covering the last section,  
**[0:10:00-0:10:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:10:00):**  we did 2.5, because we're here, you know, to take some of the money out of the internet.  The argument is that, you know, the team's been around for two years, and we've made this before,  and we have made it ourselves, and so we would request for you, if you want to continue to take your interest,  
**[0:10:16-0:10:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:10:16):**  you know, what you do is to, you know, you can see what you put in your mind with us,  but we're going to exit, so the, you know, the sky was, we're totally society testing,  and so ROPs have been going, and it works for us for now.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:10:32):**  We were already much better in the first section, so 1, 2, 3,  we'll take a minute and continue to do our life, and do our expenses.  So, anyway, I want to make a note of that, and then to the children's program,  
**[0:10:46-0:11:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:10:46):**  we're, we're, a lot of our work will be based on that, and we, at least, this is the thing,  as you know, it's a, it's a track and roll type thing, it's, it's a hard list to follow,  it's a CBT, and it's, you know, it's a new threshold for the children's program,  
**[0:11:01-0:11:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:01):**  and so there's a lot of work to do.  And I actually, just like, I'm just excited to get Craig ready to tell you,  one thing that doesn't get very hard to do in the world,  
**[0:11:10-0:11:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:10):**  is being at the same time, before I get my interest in trading twice a day.  I actually think probably that needs to be so hard,  you super-new that you could just push it out of the rest of the table.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:21):**  It was a question that I had in the other end, so,  and I want to hear both, both Sara, if you had your rejectors on this,  so makes me, you know, when you ask,  
**[0:11:30-0:11:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:30):**  it's a big deal, it has buyers, it's a huge deal, it's a difficult sell.  It's a simple question I have, and I feel like it's a huge deal,  and it's a terrible, it's a huge reduction, and I'd like to hear both of you about something.

**[0:11:52-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:52):**  and you need to look it up, you're going to get the money,  and we'll see you in the next one.  Thank you.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:12:27):**  So, one of our principles is to create all of the intelligence that we need,  and to be totally back is to try to,  to make sure that it's not necessarily a public income major using the actual system.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:12:42):**  It's a great thing.  It is so fascinating to me that the repetitive ad community  has been so like taking on better friends,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:12:49):**  because they are 100% trying to solve the same problem,  which is lowering the volume of the ad government system,  so I find that fascinating, but we sit in a room for months and business with others,  
**[0:12:59-0:13:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:12:59):**  so we have invested in this space because we do believe it's part of the solution  to a sustainable protein for the growing population.  I believe in all kinds of sustainable protein solutions,  
**[0:13:09-0:13:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:09):**  the demand is far out of supply, and all of us get to 500% agree  that many of the current ways we produce protein aren't sustainable,  we can use them.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:18):**  We think it's one of those depths, it's not the only one,  but we definitely cannot be the only way to raise protein and try to be.  The company we've invested in is a little bit different.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:27):**  It's a company called Vow.  Their purpose is to say, why would we believe that the animals we've investigated  are going to be the ones that necessarily teach us to listen to early in the lab,  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:37):**  why would we try to compete with those things.  Where they of course have other benefits in the environment,  and we all know it's a good and handy place to like,  
**[0:13:44-0:13:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:44):**  to get a lot of species and create functional foods,  but you see the same experiences, you see them all over the top.  How do you see them?  
**[0:13:52-0:14:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:52):**  We're talking about the world of disease,  so I guess it's a nice team of crowd.  So if we think about our role here,  
**[0:14:05-0:14:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:05):**  partly to inspire our economists about this,  as they think about this and they think about it,  so then we start to think about what species are thinking about the problem,  
**[0:14:13-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:13):**  and if you know what you're most concerned about,  and if you know what you're most concerned about,  is there a problem out there that you'd like to find,  
**[0:14:21-0:14:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:21):**  and waiting for the right place to be sort of in competition?  Yes, the use of it is very, very old,  and the activation from logistics challenges,  
**[0:14:32-0:14:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:32):**  of black-based collaboration,  and we at the Western one were able to make the code that really women who had to go,  just by the way, since you've done it all the way through the driving effects of technology,  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:46):**  and building this,  and excitedly pushing the streets forward,  we are ready to go,  
**[0:14:51-0:15:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:51):**  and that's all a guy who was at first,  and I didn't know all of the genes that were ready,  but she had to literally build the entire team's website,  
**[0:15:02-0:15:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:02):**  and so it's the worst companies that are itself,  and she's met post-harvest based health facilities,  and so it's really exciting to see the quality, more activating,  
**[0:15:13-0:15:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:13):**  and processing of the regenerative products in the world,  before that one,  which I really just think is part of this,  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:20):**  is it's harder, right?  Not succeed, not to be something that eventually is taken out,  but it's so important to the system,  
**[0:15:26-0:15:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:26):**  it's so important to the ecosystem that I'm trying to build,  so that's a really interesting, well,  most true moment,  
**[0:15:34-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:34):**  and I think it's a really good opportunity,  and I think it's a really good opportunity to do a lot of work,  is to try to make a hackable journey to see what has the most money,  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:42):**  and what has the most in particular,  and keep the price,  and then we can really start thinking about the conversation and play,  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:48):**  and that could also happen.  Not just with the software,  but the back-of-the-way,  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:52):**  this is just amazing,  for it's more of a signal outcome,  so it's like a consumer contour,  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:56):**  where investors are,  and it's big for these in the middle,  are the ones that have the budgets to the table,  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:02):**  so a lot of the early ag companies,  you know,  they're not accepting of farmers,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:06):**  and they just ask what,  because the farmers don't have funding,  but they also don't always have the insuring,  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:10):**  and trading,  and the prices,  and they just don't have this leverage,  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:14):**  at least to keep it in the middle,  so we can really think about why that is,  and say,  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:19):**  so in the marketing that we build,  this is quite a big ask,  but it's not as big of an opportunity,  
**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:23):**  and it's really good.  I think that one of the things that I think I lose,  and I think it's a huge difference,  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:30):**  is turning the dollars to consumers,  because consumers are getting these buyers  of the product,  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:36):**  so again,  it's a big difference in the market,  and right now,  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:40):**  if this goes anywhere, right,  yesterday,  I heard people on the stage say,  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:45):**  it wasn't possible yet,  and it's going to get to people's day,  and it's completely in the middle,  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:50):**  and it's going to get to everybody,  so maybe I'll start with the marketing,  and then I'll start with the marketing.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:54):**  Do you believe being there is something that you are really there about?  How do we get to the point where consumers  will be able to look at  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:02):**  and particularly develop a decent market,  and be able to keep the services  that are going to be so great?  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:08):**  Okay, thank you.  So,  as I said,  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:11):**  I think that's been a little bit  in the beginning of the past,  is a total qualification,  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:16):**  so,  we saw the market  go forward to the  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:20):**  20, 30, 40, 40, 40, 40,  so if that happens,  it'll end back at the 1.3%,  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:25):**  and then,  at some point,  it's going to be a little bit more  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:29):**  developing, more planning routes,  and then it's going to be a little bit more  developed at the 20%,  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:34):**  so that would be normally,  from a farm,  so if it's going to be in the 2000,  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:39):**  that's the claims and savings equivalent,  as we've done that,  we've developed the quality of our alpha,  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:45):**  and so I'm pretty proud  that I've been to a couple of things  since the beginning of our queue  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:50):**  to our highest,  to the end of the queue.  So,  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:54):**  I'd like to use the change to go  in the next few minutes,  and then we can see,  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:59):**  when we get busy,  we'll be in the interview,  and it's going to be a little bit more  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:03):**  in the roundabout.  Okay,  that's a nice one.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:06):**  Okay,  we sent our samples out from  the valley,  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:10):**  and it was going to be in the ambassador,  and they sent us to the community,  and our team started aggregates  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:16):**  for our five-page routine now,  so I'm going to,  and then you can ask your team back,  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:21):**  so I'm going to tell you where  the action will be,  so,  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:26):**  and then,  and then I'm going to do our  consultation  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:29):**  higher,  relatively,  or in between the two.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:32):**  I think it would be more  intelligent,  selective,  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:35):**  and it's also going to be a  pretty better build,  and then,  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:38):**  the consumer will feel  maybe they would still help me more,  but I would say it would be  
**[0:18:43-0:18:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:43):**  a team work,  and everyone will support it,  you know,  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:46):**  whether it's a group of states  and no brand,  and it's able to carry some  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:50):**  tasks to the community,  and I think that's going to be  the best,  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:53):**  the best,  or our goal is  to,  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:56):**  I don't know how to  talk to everyone,  and I don't know how to do all that,  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:19:00):**  but,  I'm working on it,  and I think it's going to be  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:19:03):**  a good tool,  and then you see that story  here in our paper,  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:19:06):**  and you can take a look at it  and look at it.  The other side is this  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:19:10):**  community-wide CPD board,  and I would probably cover this  a little more,  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:19:14):**  so if you were practicing it  locally,  so,  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:19:17):**  if you want to have any thoughts on  what it is that you guys want to  do,  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:19:20):**  practice this out.  So,  I think we'd like to,  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:19:23):**  I think we'd like to see that  as well.  As Sarah said,  
**[0:19:27-0:19:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:19:27):**  I think we would like to  exactly agree with what you  said,

We work towards creating the communities, the people, the friends that it comes from,  not the label and it's for design.

**[0:22:34-0:22:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:22:34):**  Let's simply have these as some questions from the audience.  The question is, what regular toys do you use?  I think it's, you know, I think it is your fellow who has maybe a way to think about  
**[0:22:47-0:23:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:22:47):**  using these toys or if you see a piece of the plate or whatever it was that you see  in the United States, you need to always have your own investment in the community.  I guess I'd be a little bit more, in the best of respect, we are wary of things that  
**[0:23:00-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:00):**  are not regular toys, you say, that's the risk profile.  Just to be clear, since we don't have, obviously, the government, I wouldn't make  lots, so definitely not in all of its credentials.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:09):**  The opposite of that, what I would say one thing you would see is pressure on the chemical  and that's the introduction, right?  So whether it's point to say, well, other use of chemicals can be seen,  
**[0:23:19-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:19):**  while it's a regular-doring pressure, if you've got a piece of that we've lost,  another piece of stress to a cross lowering the chemical intensity and production,  it's going to be an SIP.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:28):**  And the worst thing is that, for a good choice, well, biology isn't mine, right?  Like, herbicides that send its  So whether it's point to say, well, other use of chemicals can be seen,  
**[0:23:21-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:21):**  while it's a regular-doring pressure, if you've got a piece of that we've lost,  another piece of stress to a cross lowering the chemical intensity and production,  it's going to be an SIP.

**[0:23:38-0:23:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:38):**  That's why it's just your problem.  And so we're actually, the government, whatever happens in that case,  biology is the worst thing you can change until you've done your chemical work.  
**[0:23:50-0:24:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:50):**  So, challenging, the way we're investing is we have to be able to set up,  we're here as a small, really kind government,  and we need to show you the obvious shift towards tailgates.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:02):**  We need to be in a position where we can actually start to scale change.  And so, just a minute, building up the tools that could allow farms  that scale to change rather than the city is totally better,  
**[0:24:15-0:24:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:15):**  but I think we can wait for regulation.  We just have to start investing in looking at the states now,  so that we can have some time because they're where we have the regulation  
**[0:24:24-0:24:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:24):**  that actually needs that.  Well, I think it's part of the American impulse to be much worse.  We've seen a lot of this.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:31):**  It's about getting better and we're around now.  And even with the rate of corn,  if you can afford corn in this country,  
**[0:24:37-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:37):**  corn is going to be the biggest. 40% of that corn goes to the A&E,  the economy subsidized, to the goods and housing and things.  For the first time, we have to have corn.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:51):**  All of the subsidized are in the community.  We have to get the best economy out of it.  I'm going to make all the water required.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:59):**  So, if you're going to have to face the vehicles now,  please imagine it as a completely free-to-be capital.  I don't know what anyone is thinking, but I can just say that.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:25:09):**  Because, that's taking up a lot of energy.  I think these two are going to have got to be in the midst of  a whole new economy being worse for them.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:25:16):**  Every quarter year is getting ready or put on the farm bill.  We're going to become a bigger society.  You know, the world thinks that we're having an incentivizing

**[0:25:34-0:25:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:25:34):**  and I don't know how to say the much in the history of the play code out there,  is in Australia, we're looking at IBCs who are studying the New Zealand.

**[0:25:45-0:25:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:25:45):**  on this big, lean, big farm.  So, free regulatory conditions to say,  we will, as government, bear the risk of whatever might happen  
**[0:25:54-0:26:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:25:54):**  as it starts to roll out on economy, more human risks.  And, kind of laid out conditions that make up same box,  where there's too kind for development of good insurance products  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:02):**  and development of good finance products,  and development of work technology.  So, that's just a great, great moment.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:07):**  And, it's going to be super exciting to see people  turn up and really decide that we want to do that.  Well, Jamie, let's see what you think about this.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:14):**  First question, this is a part of the act.  What is the message that you made that they are closed?  The most people I've asked have been like,  
**[0:26:22-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:22):**  you know, 30 seconds or less.  And, I was like, ooh, you know, start that.  So, this is a big era.

**[0:26:50-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:50):**  CulaBio.  CulaBio is a potential organic, or place for synthetic,  I think, we can get closer to, like, 30-40 or whatever,  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:00):**  exactly, right?  But, the real subsidy factor is that they can get cost  below that they want to be able to be set up by a reactor  
**[0:27:07-0:27:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:07):**  on the farm.  And, you can disrupt this distribution channel,  or, like I said, that is a completely different,  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:14):**  that's, to be actual, pretty easy.  Can you bring us to our next table,  we'll go to the other table.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:20):**  Can you let me move this to you,  so we can get off the other side of the web, too?  Yeah, yeah, I can.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:25):**  I can't see that.  I can't see it.  Awesome.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:28):**  Awesome.  I'll take this other side.  So, it's the same as we did here in the previous table.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:33):**  What do you do in the previous table?  It's like 30% of the waste.  All this is between our history,  
**[0:27:38-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:38):**  all this is actually some storage,  and so it's more of a rock,  and all these things leak out all of the water,  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:44):**  all of the influence, and it's moist,  and it's a very specific waste.  We call rock, and we call it a waste.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:50):** sburg can can be very ==  Which one, and what you are saying,  it's RUN,  
**[0:27:58-0:28:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:58):**  which would defy that health good decision.  Everyone...  who may be outsideU.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:28:08):**  You think would expire? .  You think that would interfere more personally.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:28:18):** .  or greater high-level devices,  and it's a way to be good.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:28:22):**  It's very up to order.  I'll just say, as you can read,  how many of you especially coming to know,  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:28:26):**  who both of us are not actually on the farm  from these places,  who both said would recommend that they actually  
**[0:28:31-0:28:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:28:31):**  really talk about the reality of producing soon.  The one is called the New Farm by Brent Krusty,  which is actually a work list on the site  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:28:41):**  by the farm outside of Toronto,  and it's a work on child creation,  and it was released by real people  
**[0:28:46-0:28:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:28:46):**  to the communities around Toronto  and particularly writes briefly about  how to do farming in the industry.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:28:54):**  And then farming other actors,  so I said I'm not really,  she's one of the staffs that I work on,  
**[0:29:00-0:29:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:29:00):**  so she really had those between tables  of farming and devices  and talked about the real challenges  
**[0:29:07-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:29:07):**  that I think, how do you,  in theory, which really is how we're trying to  begin around what are we really trying to do  
**[0:29:14-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:29:14):**  and how are we gonna end it and what's the need to go from.  Those would be two more of our panels for you.  If you're a podcast listener,  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:29:22):**  you can check out our podcast.  It's called the ITEM So Live,  but you'll get a chance to see  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:29:27):**  the two of us are recommending one,  which sometimes will come from your hair  and stuff that you're gonna see  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:29:31):**  when you're watching the process  and you see people love it.  Just a good in-depth story of what it actually  
**[0:29:37-0:29:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:29:37):**  makes today for the world and how hard it is.  The other one is called The Divers Love the Difference.  It's negotiating and one of the things that I burn in  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:29:44):**  when I'm feeding from the operators  is that I think that's the time the table is held for.  But if you're too far,  
**[0:29:49-0:29:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:29:49):**  then when you're on the other side of the table,  that's when you know we're not in a circle.  You can say correct me if I just want to be.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:29:56):**  So having the tactics to be able to find out  when you're in a technical partnership  is a really important thing.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:30:03):**  So the final part of the topic is beyond course,  like I'm going to be doing.  It's the question, is do you think you have  
**[0:30:11-0:30:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:30:11):**  any knowledge to take the first step  in what you're doing?  And that's it for this bonus episode of Ag Tech So What.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:30:33):**  Thank you to the panellists, Mark Lewis, Renee Vasilos,  Sarah Nolette and Paul Lightfoot from Bright Farms.  Actually, if you enjoyed listening to Paul,

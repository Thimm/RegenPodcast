**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:01:28):**  chains instead of carbon and fuel.

**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:01:59):**  investments, all the way to the consumer.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:02:02):**  Our three T's are being innovative in technology, for example steel, and they'll take us all

**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:02:26):**  We are a series of same-stage investors in agriculture companies.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:02:31):**  We look all along this budget as well, and everything we do has a focus around helping  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:02:35):**  to make sure that we transition to a better control and communicate resilience for better  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:02:39):**  future.

**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:02:44):**  This is me running on the executive editor for DevCon there.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:02:48):**  We do a lot around building the ecosystem, so creating content, bringing people together,  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:02:53):**  knowing that change isn't just about the investment, all of the debate, but also the broader ecosystem  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:02:57):**  with the crisis.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:02:58):**  We also use the core social security.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:00):**  We invest in new hardware as well, and we've been that type of focus.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:04):**  It's really important for us to be writing to our partners in this space.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:08):**  We don't have a set up in New Zealand, but of our first nine investments, we know there's  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:13):**  a goal going into it.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:14):**  So we're super excited about that, and think that it's what our own new world would have  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:18):**  been if it were in the job already.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:20):**  Okay.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:22):**  Really personally, with the major initiatives we have, I call the funds that I manage,  
**[0:03:29-0:03:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:29):**  and I think that is important, so I work as a service for the American Energy, who has  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:36):**  done research on this data and practices that we know will help build.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:42):**  While it isn't a one-size-fits-all, there are some practices that have been scientifically  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:48):**  proven to build this data, and so what we look to do is invest in those companies that  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:54):**  are one of our whole team to help the practices, all of them that will help come out of their  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:03:59):**  box are a lot of fun, how are we actually implementing these practices at scale.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:05):**  And so it's very nice to have a company like this that's really type 5.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:09):**  Yeah, it's great to be here.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:11):**  Great, thanks so much.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:12):**  So, what do you say we do?  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:14):**  So, you are saying that it is big enough, but it's a big opportunity.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:19):**  One of the problems in America is that we've seen everything through very conservative  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:25):**  elections.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:26):**  I'd love to hear other agencies inspired by things that are different, and have become  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:31):**  so consistent, it's not hard to be in front of the other agencies as they're saying this.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:36):**  What do they learn in Australia?  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:39):**  We think we should be thinking about right here, the many reasons that stories are invested  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:44):**  in the American business sector.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:46):**  Some of the students are really  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:47):**  definitely become science students, and they keep learning.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:50):**  Yeah, so it is a fascinating place.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:51):**  When I moved there six years ago, it's a big deal for South hockey.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:55):**  I wish I could really say that I picked Australia on a map, and we did a couple of basketball  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:04:59):**  games, and there was an accidental, where as the people standing up there, Australia  
**[0:05:03-0:04:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:03):**  is a great agriculture, tons of different  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:05):**  So, very low subsidies, farmers really innovated, highly adopting the technology, and it's a  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:12):**  great ag economy.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:13):**  There's also great ag and local research, and there's a hundred trillions of dollars  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:16):**  going into ag increases every year, and that's a big part of the subsidy.

**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:24):**  and from the same ag and agriculture that's been involved really well.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:27):**  And I guess what I learned from that is basically the ecosystem approach.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:31):**  How do we bring in the corporates?  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:33):**  How do we involve farmers?  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:34):**  How do we not come at ag tech from the Silicon Valley only trial?  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:38):**  How do we instead bring the best practices of Silicon Valley to agriculture and agriculture?  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:42):**  And I'm also a major, taking a second role, and so that's where we try to focus.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:48):**  It's not just trying to compete, but actually embrace who was and who did agriculture.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:54):**  It's exactly the same point.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:05:56):**  One thing Americans can probably learn is just to be more open-minded to each other's  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:00):**  geographies and what you might learn from them.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:02):**  We see a lot of ag tech companies wanting to be in commerce, it's not just saying, you  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:05):**  know, this is not the southern hemisphere.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:07):**  We see them wanting to work with the farmers because they are adopting some technology  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:11):**  so for investors, speaking about mine, I think the benefit is that I want to give you two

**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:17):**  And we can happily redirect as well in this episode?  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:20):**  Yes, it's three of our first nine investment insights in the US.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:23):**  We're in a bad hole, continuing for a venture in the on-techs in the US.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:26):**  Okay.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:27):**  Renee, you're next.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:28):**  I'm next.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:29):**  Yesterday, we heard some people say that this is the sector that we believe in.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:33):**  We believe in basic capital.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:35):**  I don't know if that's true or not, but you know we're taking a piece of the paper, starting  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:39):**  with the title, it stands like entirely basic, idea, basically.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:44):**  Do you think that the second, more basic, term, how do you be invested in burning down?  
**[0:06:49-0:06:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:49):**  Yes, it is.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:51):**  It is more basic capital.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:53):**  One of the things it's ended for is just biology, right?  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:56):**  Like what we're working in is biological systems.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:06:59):**  I was in John  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:07:09):**  Kennedy's office, and I was a junior team back there.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:07:11):**  We were interested in health resources.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:07:13):**  We were able to make health patients in a box, right?  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:07:16):**  And so the development cycles are so, that's just the reality.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:07:21):**  You have to wait for a bi-system to come around.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:07:24):**  You can't just simulate bi-systems and then to test new technologies.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:07:27):**  So there's just the reality of the system that we're in.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:07:31):**  You know, people buy the mobility, you have to do some really important testing solutions.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:07:36):**  And there's also this reality that it's quite of that critical importance to get all of the human beings.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:07:43):**  There's actually not as much money being added to our track.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:07:47):**  And so you don't have this activity cycle and money flow that you haven't come up with or seen.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:07:58):**  So it's really these dynamics that we need more AC capital and more people to actually develop solutions that will drive change on time.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:08:07):**  And even in the rest of the world, are you going to have to pick up a lot more equipment for the future?  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:08:12):**  We have to power really late in this world.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:08:16):**  We actually don't have non-concessors.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:08:19):**  And we're actually making other venture-based products.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:08:23):**  And so we are actually like super capable of doing this.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:08:28):**  But the reality is that if you build a venture, these people are not out of five percent of the cycle.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:08:34):**  The reality is they're all accepting.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:08:36):**  It's much longer than the title.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:08:38):**  The tech leaders just said yes because the tech-based market is so hard to do next.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:08:44):**  And yesterday morning, around the same time that people were talking about the new space,  
**[0:08:49-0:08:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:08:49):**  I also heard some people on this stage say that a sort of 20 percent carry model,  
**[0:08:56-0:09:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:08:56):**  would even be the right model for this case that perhaps it's an explanatory or an extracted model that looks none the sector.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:09:05):**  But when you look here, you know, and I thought this morning, as we looked at the high truck up on the screen that's there,  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:09:12):**  we're going to need a whole lot of capital in order to take the world, and this is what we're going to need to do for the world.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:09:17):**  You know, we have a case to fill a model.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:09:20):**  And it's like, do you agree that that model is for here, in real case, equally?  
**[0:09:25-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:09:25):**  What's he doing?  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:09:27):**  We thought, you know, we might have an argument with the models and, you know,  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:09:31):**  could we make a video about how the servers are providing the real or fighting time for kind of outside of the environment,  
**[0:09:36-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:09:36):**  and sort of the one that you guys do, you know, some of our best team operators did to the executive.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:09:43):**  Just in the past, our reach here outside the room was to keep them on the front page,  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:09:49):**  which is a very easy message, and we also have a scenario where people can just say,  
**[0:09:53-0:09:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:09:53):**  yeah, we get the good money.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:09:55):**  We are still here, I thought, because we're in the school, we're covering the last section,  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:10:00):**  we did 2.5, because we're here, you know, to take some of the money out of the internet.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:10:04):**  The argument is that, you know, the team's been around for two years, and we've made this before,  
**[0:10:09-0:10:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:10:09):**  and we have made it ourselves, and so we would request for you, if you want to continue to take your interest,  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:10:16):**  you know, what you do is to, you know, you can see what you put in your mind with us,  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:10:21):**  but we're going to exit, so the, you know, the sky was, we're totally society testing,  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:10:27):**  and so ROPs have been going, and it works for us for now.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:10:32):**  We were already much better in the first section, so 1, 2, 3,  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:10:36):**  we'll take a minute and continue to do our life, and do our expenses.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:10:41):**  So, anyway, I want to make a note of that, and then to the children's program,  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:10:46):**  we're, we're, a lot of our work will be based on that, and we, at least, this is the thing,  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:10:51):**  as you know, it's a, it's a track and roll type thing, it's, it's a hard list to follow,  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:10:56):**  it's a CBT, and it's, you know, it's a new threshold for the children's program,  
**[0:11:01-0:11:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:01):**  and so there's a lot of work to do.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:03):**  And I actually, just like, I'm just excited to get Craig ready to tell you,  
**[0:11:07-0:11:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:07):**  one thing that doesn't get very hard to do in the world,

**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:15):**  I actually think probably that needs to be so hard,  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:17):**  you super-new that you could just push it out of the rest of the table.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:21):**  It was a question that I had in the other end, so,  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:23):**  and I want to hear both, both Sara, if you had your rejectors on this,  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:27):**  so makes me, you know, when you ask,  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:30):**  it's a big deal, it has buyers, it's a huge deal, it's a difficult sell.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:33):**  It's a simple question I have, and I feel like it's a huge deal,  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:37):**  and it's a terrible, it's a huge reduction, and I'd like to hear both of you about something.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:41):**  We have kind of an out-of-bust-in, and it's still amazing,  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:45):**  it's a family partnership,  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:46):**  and it's a really, really beautiful time, so if you learn on it, learn about it,  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:52):**  and you need to look it up, you're going to get the money,  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:55):**  and we'll see you in the next one.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:11:57):**  Thank you.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:12:27):**  So, one of our principles is to create all of the intelligence that we need,  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:12:32):**  and to be totally back is to try to,  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:12:36):**  to make sure that it's not necessarily a public income major using the actual system.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:12:42):**  It's a great thing.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:12:43):**  It is so fascinating to me that the repetitive ad community  
**[0:12:47-0:12:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:12:47):**  has been so like taking on better friends,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:12:49):**  because they are 100% trying to solve the same problem,  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:12:52):**  which is lowering the volume of the ad government system,  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:12:54):**  so I find that fascinating, but we sit in a room for months and business with others,  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:12:59):**  so we have invested in this space because we do believe it's part of the solution  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:03):**  to a sustainable protein for the growing population.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:06):**  I believe in all kinds of sustainable protein solutions,  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:09):**  the demand is far out of supply, and all of us get to 500% agree  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:14):**  that many of the current ways we produce protein aren't sustainable,  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:17):**  we can use them.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:18):**  We think it's one of those depths, it's not the only one,  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:21):**  but we definitely cannot be the only way to raise protein and try to be.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:25):**  The company we've invested in is a little bit different.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:27):**  It's a company called Vow.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:28):**  Their purpose is to say, why would we believe that the animals we've investigated  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:33):**  are going to be the ones that necessarily teach us to listen to early in the lab,  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:37):**  why would we try to compete with those things.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:40):**  Where they of course have other benefits in the environment,  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:42):**  and we all know it's a good and handy place to like,  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:44):**  to get a lot of species and create functional foods,  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:48):**  but you see the same experiences, you see them all over the top.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:51):**  How do you see them?  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:52):**  We're talking about the world of disease,  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:55):**  so I guess it's a nice team of crowd.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:13:59):**  So if we think about our role here,  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:05):**  partly to inspire our economists about this,  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:07):**  as they think about this and they think about it,  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:09):**  so then we start to think about what species are thinking about the problem,  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:13):**  and if you know what you're most concerned about,  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:16):**  and if you know what you're most concerned about,  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:18):**  is there a problem out there that you'd like to find,  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:21):**  and waiting for the right place to be sort of in competition?  
**[0:14:24-0:14:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:24):**  Yes, the use of it is very, very old,  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:27):**  and the activation from logistics challenges,  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:32):**  of black-based collaboration,  
**[0:14:34-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:34):**  and we at the Western one were able to make the code that really women who had to go,  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:42):**  just by the way, since you've done it all the way through the driving effects of technology,  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:46):**  and building this,  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:48):**  and excitedly pushing the streets forward,  
**[0:14:50-0:14:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:50):**  we are ready to go,  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:51):**  and that's all a guy who was at first,  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:53):**  and I didn't know all of the genes that were ready,  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:14:56):**  but she had to literally build the entire team's website,  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:02):**  and so it's the worst companies that are itself,  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:06):**  and she's met post-harvest based health facilities,  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:09):**  and so it's really exciting to see the quality, more activating,  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:13):**  and processing of the regenerative products in the world,  
**[0:15:16-0:15:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:16):**  before that one,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:17):**  which I really just think is part of this,  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:20):**  is it's harder, right?  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:21):**  Not succeed, not to be something that eventually is taken out,  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:24):**  but it's so important to the system,  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:26):**  it's so important to the ecosystem that I'm trying to build,  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:29):**  so that's a really interesting, well,  
**[0:15:33-0:15:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:33):**  most true moment,  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:34):**  and I think it's a really good opportunity,  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:36):**  and I think it's a really good opportunity to do a lot of work,  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:39):**  is to try to make a hackable journey to see what has the most money,  
**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:42):**  and what has the most in particular,  
**[0:15:44-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:44):**  and keep the price,  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:45):**  and then we can really start thinking about the conversation and play,  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:48):**  and that could also happen.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:50):**  Not just with the software,  
**[0:15:51-0:15:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:51):**  but the back-of-the-way,  
**[0:15:52-0:15:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:52):**  this is just amazing,  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:53):**  for it's more of a signal outcome,  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:55):**  so it's like a consumer contour,  
**[0:15:56-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:56):**  where investors are,

**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:15:59):**  are the ones that have the budgets to the table,  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:02):**  so a lot of the early ag companies,  
**[0:16:04-0:16:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:04):**  you know,  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:05):**  they're not accepting of farmers,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:06):**  and they just ask what,  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:07):**  because the farmers don't have funding,  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:09):**  but they also don't always have the insuring,  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:10):**  and trading,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:11):**  and the prices,  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:12):**  and they just don't have this leverage,  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:14):**  at least to keep it in the middle,  
**[0:16:16-0:16:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:16):**  so we can really think about why that is,  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:18):**  and say,  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:19):**  so in the marketing that we build,  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:20):**  this is quite a big ask,  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:21):**  but it's not as big of an opportunity,  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:23):**  and it's really good.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:25):**  I think that one of the things that I think I lose,  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:28):**  and I think it's a huge difference,  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:30):**  is turning the dollars to consumers,  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:32):**  because consumers are getting these buyers  
**[0:16:35-0:16:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:35):**  of the product,  
**[0:16:36-0:16:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:36):**  so again,  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:37):**  it's a big difference in the market,  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:39):**  and right now,  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:40):**  if this goes anywhere, right,  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:42):**  yesterday,  
**[0:16:43-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:43):**  I heard people on the stage say,  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:45):**  it wasn't possible yet,  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:47):**  and it's going to get to people's day,  
**[0:16:49-0:16:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:49):**  and it's completely in the middle,  
**[0:16:50-0:16:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:50):**  and it's going to get to everybody,  
**[0:16:51-0:16:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:51):**  so maybe I'll start with the marketing,  
**[0:16:53-0:16:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:53):**  and then I'll start with the marketing.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:54):**  Do you believe being there is something that you are really there about?  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:16:58):**  How do we get to the point where consumers  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:00):**  will be able to look at  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:02):**  and particularly develop a decent market,  
**[0:17:04-0:17:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:04):**  and be able to keep the services  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:06):**  that are going to be so great?  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:08):**  Okay, thank you.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:09):**  So,  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:10):**  as I said,  
**[0:17:11-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:11):**  I think that's been a little bit  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:13):**  in the beginning of the past,  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:14):**  is a total qualification,  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:16):**  so,  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:17):**  we saw the market  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:19):**  go forward to the  
**[0:17:20-0:17:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:20):**  20, 30, 40, 40, 40, 40,  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:22):**  so if that happens,  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:23):**  it'll end back at the 1.3%,  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:25):**  and then,  
**[0:17:26-0:17:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:26):**  at some point,  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:27):**  it's going to be a little bit more  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:29):**  developing, more planning routes,  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:30):**  and then it's going to be a little bit more  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:32):**  developed at the 20%,  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:34):**  so that would be normally,  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:36):**  from a farm,  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:37):**  so if it's going to be in the 2000,  
**[0:17:39-0:17:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:39):**  that's the claims and savings equivalent,  
**[0:17:41-0:17:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:41):**  as we've done that,  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:42):**  we've developed the quality of our alpha,  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:45):**  and so I'm pretty proud  
**[0:17:47-0:17:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:47):**  that I've been to a couple of things  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:48):**  since the beginning of our queue  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:50):**  to our highest,  
**[0:17:51-0:17:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:51):**  to the end of the queue.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:53):**  So,  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:54):**  I'd like to use the change to go  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:56):**  in the next few minutes,  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:57):**  and then we can see,  
**[0:17:59-0:18:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:17:59):**  when we get busy,  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:00):**  we'll be in the interview,  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:01):**  and it's going to be a little bit more  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:03):**  in the roundabout.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:04):**  Okay,  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:05):**  that's a nice one.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:06):**  Okay,  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:07):**  we sent our samples out from  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:09):**  the valley,  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:10):**  and it was going to be in the ambassador,  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:12):**  and they sent us to the community,  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:14):**  and our team started aggregates  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:16):**  for our five-page routine now,  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:18):**  so I'm going to,  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:19):**  and then you can ask your team back,  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:21):**  so I'm going to tell you where  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:23):**  the action will be,  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:25):**  so,  
**[0:18:26-0:18:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:26):**  and then,  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:18:27):**  and then I'm going to do our

**[0:22:15-0:22:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:22:15):**  I'm going to buy the eggs and then we'll pick up the eggs.

**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:22:28):**  I mean, we need to have a piece of that we're going to have that is going to be  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:22:31):**  a little bit of a value for it.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:22:34):**  Let's simply have these as some questions from the audience.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:22:38):**  The question is, what regular toys do you use?  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:22:42):**  I think it's, you know, I think it is your fellow who has maybe a way to think about  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:22:47):**  using these toys or if you see a piece of the plate or whatever it was that you see  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:22:51):**  in the United States, you need to always have your own investment in the community.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:22:55):**  I guess I'd be a little bit more, in the best of respect, we are wary of things that  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:00):**  are not regular toys, you say, that's the risk profile.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:03):**  Just to be clear, since we don't have, obviously, the government, I wouldn't make  
**[0:23:07-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:07):**  lots, so definitely not in all of its credentials.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:09):**  The opposite of that, what I would say one thing you would see is pressure on the chemical  
**[0:23:15-0:23:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:15):**  and that's the introduction, right?  
**[0:23:16-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:16):**  So whether it's point to say, well, other use of chemicals can be seen,  
**[0:23:19-0:23:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:19):**  while it's a regular-doring pressure, if you've got a piece of that we've lost,  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:22):**  another piece of stress to a cross lowering the chemical intensity and production,

**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:28):**  And the worst thing is that, for a good choice, well, biology isn't mine, right?  
**[0:23:34-0:23:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:34):**  Like, herbicides that send its

**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:38):**  That's why it's just your problem.

**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:45):**  biology is the worst thing you can change until you've done your chemical work.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:50):**  So, challenging, the way we're investing is we have to be able to set up,  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:55):**  we're here as a small, really kind government,  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:23:58):**  and we need to show you the obvious shift towards tailgates.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:02):**  We need to be in a position where we can actually start to scale change.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:06):**  And so, just a minute, building up the tools that could allow farms  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:11):**  that scale to change rather than the city is totally better,  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:15):**  but I think we can wait for regulation.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:18):**  We just have to start investing in looking at the states now,  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:21):**  so that we can have some time because they're where we have the regulation  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:24):**  that actually needs that.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:26):**  Well, I think it's part of the American impulse to be much worse.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:30):**  We've seen a lot of this.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:31):**  It's about getting better and we're around now.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:33):**  And even with the rate of corn,  
**[0:24:35-0:24:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:35):**  if you can afford corn in this country,  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:37):**  corn is going to be the biggest. 40% of that corn goes to the A&E,  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:42):**  the economy subsidized, to the goods and housing and things.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:48):**  For the first time, we have to have corn.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:51):**  All of the subsidized are in the community.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:54):**  We have to get the best economy out of it.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:56):**  I'm going to make all the water required.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:24:59):**  So, if you're going to have to face the vehicles now,  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:25:02):**  please imagine it as a completely free-to-be capital.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:25:06):**  I don't know what anyone is thinking, but I can just say that.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:25:09):**  Because, that's taking up a lot of energy.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:25:12):**  I think these two are going to have got to be in the midst of  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:25:14):**  a whole new economy being worse for them.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:25:16):**  Every quarter year is getting ready or put on the farm bill.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:25:20):**  We're going to become a bigger society.

**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:25:27):**  So, that's a huge work that's been really, really going to be helpful.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:25:32):**  One thing you were in radiation,

**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:27):**  So, this is a big era.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:30):**  We've got there, we've got a company that does onsite waste  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:33):**  and is good at organic waste.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:35):**  And, for every dollar they make in revenue,  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:38):**  we have waste for an implementable and mechanism-based.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:42):**  Okay.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:43):**  Thank you.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:44):**  So, this is one of the things that we got in space.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:47):**  It's probably on the top of the table.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:48):**  Another one that they did here today,  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:50):**  CulaBio.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:51):**  CulaBio is a potential organic, or place for synthetic,  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:26:55):**  I think, we can get closer to, like, 30-40 or whatever,  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:00):**  exactly, right?  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:01):**  But, the real subsidy factor is that they can get cost  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:05):**  below that they want to be able to be set up by a reactor  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:07):**  on the farm.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:08):**  And, you can disrupt this distribution channel,  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:11):**  or, like I said, that is a completely different,  
**[0:27:14-0:27:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:14):**  that's, to be actual, pretty easy.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:17):**  Can you bring us to our next table,  
**[0:27:18-0:27:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:18):**  we'll go to the other table.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:20):**  Can you let me move this to you,  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:21):**  so we can get off the other side of the web, too?  
**[0:27:23-0:27:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:23):**  Yeah, yeah, I can.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:25):**  I can't see that.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:26):**  I can't see it.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:27):**  Awesome.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:28):**  Awesome.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:29):**  I'll take this other side.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:30):**  So, it's the same as we did here in the previous table.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:33):**  What do you do in the previous table?  
**[0:27:35-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:35):**  It's like 30% of the waste.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:37):**  All this is between our history,  
**[0:27:38-0:27:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:38):**  all this is actually some storage,  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:40):**  and so it's more of a rock,  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:41):**  and all these things leak out all of the water,  
**[0:27:44-0:27:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:44):**  all of the influence, and it's moist,  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:46):**  and it's a very specific waste.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:48):**  We call rock, and we call it a waste.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:27:50):** sburg can can be very ==

**[0:28:18-0:28:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:28:18):** .

**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:28:24):**  how many of you especially coming to know,

**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:28:41):**  by the farm outside of Toronto,

**[0:28:44-0:28:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:28:44):**  and it was released by real people  
**[0:28:46-0:28:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:28:46):**  to the communities around Toronto

**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:28:56):**  so I said I'm not really,  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:28:58):**  she's one of the staffs that I work on,

**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:29:17):**  Those would be two more of our panels for you.

**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:29:44):**  when I'm feeding from the operators  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:29:46):**  is that I think that's the time the table is held for.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:29:48):**  But if you're too far,

**[0:29:53-0:29:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:29:53):**  You can say correct me if I just want to be.

**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/10/27/investing-in-tech-to-enable-regen-ag#t=0:30:00):**  is a really important thing.

### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 19:59:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast, brought to you by AgThentic.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:00:07):**  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:00:09):**  If you've been listening with us for a while, you'll have noticed that we removed the intro.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:00:14):**  I'd been wanting to update or get rid of this for a while, but some recent listener feedback  
**[0:00:19-0:00:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:00:19):**  gave me the push I needed to make it happen.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:00:21):**  So thanks, Bernie, and goodbye to long intro.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:00:24):**  Today's episode is rebroadcast from 2017, when I spoke with Alison Koff, CEO and founder  
**[0:00:31-0:00:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:00:31):**  of AgriList.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:00:32):**  AgriList is an American ag tech company that has built what they call a cultivation management  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:00:37):**  platform to help indoor farmers and specialty croppers.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:00:41):**  Since we recorded this, Alison has been named to the Forbes 30 Under 30, and AgriList, her  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:00:46):**  company, has actually rebranded so that it's now called Artemis.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:00:50):**  More info on both of these are in the show notes.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:00:53):**  The episode is largely the same, though we've added a bit of polish.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:00:58):**  That said, the audio quality is not amazing.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:00):**  We used to struggle with this that longtime listeners know, so sorry about that, but we  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:04):**  did want to bring you this for a few reasons.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:06):**  First, indoor ag is still an exciting space, and Alison's insights are great.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:11):**  And second, at the end, Alison and I cover some ground that's really relevant for International  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:16):**  Women's Day, even though we're a week late.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:18):**  Anyways, that's enough for me.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:20):**  We start the episode with Alison, who has a degree in physics and did not grow up on  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:24):**  a farm, explaining how she got into agriculture.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:28):**  I started working for a greenhouse company back in 2011 that was trying to solve a lot  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:34):**  of challenges in terms of the actual production side by building greenhouses closer to the  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:39):**  point of consumption and growing more sustainably for the local population.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:43):**  And I just fell in love.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:45):**  I fell in love with the ag industry.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:47):**  I fell in love with growers.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:49):**  The idea of growing food to me was incredibly beautiful.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:53):**  It's something that we all eat, but we don't all actually get to touch the system at play.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:01:58):**  And just getting really close to it was something I just fell in love with.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:02:02):**  So I knew that this was a place for me.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:02:05):**  This love for agriculture led Alison to start an ag tech company.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:02:10):**  The whole problem that I'm trying to solve at AgriList is it all originated there.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:02:14):**  It all originated when you're doing the duties of farming every day.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:02:19):**  So you're trying to make ends meet.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:02:21):**  You have low margins.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:02:22):**  You're trying to understand who you're selling to.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:02:26):**  And that to me is a data problem, which is the problem we're trying to solve at AgriList,  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:02:29):**  which is build software that can make all of those data problems, not problems, but  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:02:35):**  instead benefits to the grower.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:02:37):**  So how can you increase the margin by looking at all the information at your hands and trying  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:02:43):**  to use that to complete the picture and really focus on that margin side?  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:02:48):**  I love that story coming in from non-ag.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:02:50):**  That's been my journey as well, sort of coming more from the tech engineering side.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:02:55):**  How has that been working in the ag industry without a kind of ag background?  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:01):**  You know, the funniest thing about that is, so whenever you talk to somebody who's in  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:04):**  the ag industry, but is in conventional ag, right, so any of the conventional ag fields,  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:08):**  they'll tell me that I don't have a background in ag.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:10):**  And anybody in our space, in the controlled environment space specifically, I've got one  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:14):**  of the longest backgrounds in ag, which is this very interesting, nuanced problem that  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:19):**  exists in the industry.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:21):**  So I've worked on the operations side of controlled environment ag for the better part of a decade  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:25):**  now.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:26):**  And probably there's only about three or four companies that have been around in the fast  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:32):**  growth, vendor-backed, controlled environment space in that period.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:37):**  So there aren't that many of us in this group that have done that.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:40):**  And there's not that many of us that have a tech background as well, where we can combine  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:43):**  those two pieces of information to actually create this interesting solution for the state.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:48):**  And so, no, I didn't grow up on a farm.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:51):**  My parents weren't farmers.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:52):**  But I actually have been one of the few people to have worked in the industry as long as  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:56):**  I have, at least in the specific industry, right?  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:03:58):**  Now, that's not to say that it's not the entire industry as a whole.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:01):**  One of the challenges that you do face, or at least I face, is I know how most of these  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:07):**  facilities operate.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:09):**  But the greenhouse industry as a whole has been around for decades and decades and decades,  
**[0:04:12-0:04:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:12):**  and it is more conventional.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:14):**  And so that's a state that there is this sort of outsider feel.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:18):**  But I think that there's a big trust element.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:21):**  I think ag in general is based on an element of trust.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:25):**  A lot of sales happen via, I trust that this person can solve this problem for me, and  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:28):**  I trust the product or service that they provide.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:31):**  And when I go in the facility and I can speak to speak because I actually understand it  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:36):**  and there's a curiosity there, then the growers end up tending to build that trust in me.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:42):**  That's a roundabout answer.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:44):**  No, but a good one.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:47):**  And that's been my experience too, that despite sometimes being an outsider coming in with  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:53):**  curiosity and willingness to learn, then people want to teach you and want to see what they're  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:57):**  passionate about, what they're doing.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:04:58):**  You mentioned that green sauces are different or that that's one kind of flavor of indoor  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:05:03):**  ag.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:05:04):**  And I'm the one that would love to get the kind of indoor farming 101 from you for those  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:05:09):**  who aren't as familiar with the different types of systems.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:05:13):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:05:15):**  The way that we think about the industry at least, and I know that this isn't necessarily  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:05:19):**  standardized yet for the way that most people think about the space, is that there is really  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:05:23):**  two different types of systems at play here.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:05:26):**  There is a fully enclosed indoor system where you're not relying on sunlight at all, and  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:05:32):**  then a hybrid system where you do have sunlight, but you might also have supplemental light  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:05:36):**  in your building in a greenhouse where there's access to natural light.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:05:39):**  Now there's a whole different spectrum of types of growing systems that could fit within  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:05:43):**  those two pictures.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:05:45):**  You can have hydroponics where you're submerging the roots of a plant into water.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:05:50):**  You can have aquaculture or aquaponics where there's fish involved in the process as well,  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:05:55):**  and you're using the fish process to actually fertilize the plants.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:05:59):**  There's a whole filtrated system there at play.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:06:02):**  You can have aeroponics where you're misting the roots of the crops with the nutrient solution.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:06:06):**  Again, you can have soil.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:06:08):**  You can have conventional soil as well.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:06:10):**  There's this sort of full spectrum of different types of growing systems.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:06:14):**  The way that we think about it typically is that there's either no sunlight or sunlight  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:06:17):**  involved in the picture.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:06:19):**  One of the interesting things in the market is that they're pretty segmented as well.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:06:24):**  The vertical farming or fully enclosed farming has only really been around for the last few  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:06:28):**  years and it's really in a infancy.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:06:31):**  There's been people who have tried it for a long time, but in the last few years it  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:06:36):**  started to gain a lot of momentum because people are starting to figure out the unit  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:06:39):**  economics, the cost of LEDs is going down, and you happen to have a lot of things in  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:06:43):**  your favor related to the macro challenges of efficiencies but also food safety and challenges  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:06:49):**  around pathogens in our crops specifically for things like leafy greens and herbs.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:06:55):**  That space is starting to take off.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:06:57):**  Then you've got the greenhouse industry, which I would also categorize in two different spaces,  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:07:01):**  which is you've got the greenhouse industry of old.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:07:05):**  You've got your Almeria, Spain.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:07:06):**  You've got most of rural China where greenhouses are present.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:07:10):**  You've got low tech plastic facilities that serve for low margin, high efficiency, fast  
**[0:07:16-0:07:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:07:16):**  distribution and raw distribution crops.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:07:19):**  Then you've got this high tech, maybe more automated, intelligence driven, glass greenhouses,  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:07:26):**  the facilities of the Netherlands and now the US and Canada that are really quickly  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:07:31):**  taking off because, again, of those challenges in the system of efficiencies and supply and  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:07:37):**  food safety and just the ability to get a higher margin than in conventional applications  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:07:43):**  for certain crops.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:07:44):**  Yeah, I'm really glad you mentioned the certain crop distinction because there's obviously  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:07:49):**  a conversation around the world about feeding the growing population and healthier food  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:07:53):**  and the macro trends, some of which you mentioned.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:07:56):**  What's your view on indoor agriculture's ability to feed that growing population and what role  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:08:02):**  do you see it playing?  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:08:04):**  Are we going to move to a much more fully indoor system and can you grow everything  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:08:09):**  indoors or where it aligns and maybe barriers in that sense?  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:08:15):**  Yeah, indoor ag is a tool in the agricultural toolkit is how I would phrase it.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:08:22):**  You can only grow certain crops indoors and I would say ever actually.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:08:26):**  I wouldn't even say that that's a now thing.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:08:28):**  I would say now we've got a small group of things you can grow indoors and I'd say in  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:08:32):**  the future, 10 years out, 20 years out, you can probably increase that spectrum.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:08:36):**  You're never going to do certain crops indoors because it doesn't make sense economically.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:08:41):**  At the end of the day, ag is about economics more than almost anything.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:08:46):**  If you think about things that you can grow really well indoors, take a vertical farm  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:08:50):**  as an example.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:08:51):**  You've got a fully enclosed warehouse and you're trying to grow things in racks.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:08:55):**  The reason for that is you're trying to optimize your growable area.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:08:59):**  Your spur footage of growable area.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:00):**  If I'm going to stack things, well, the things that I can grow there by nature have to be  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:05):**  physically short.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:06):**  You can't grow vine crops there because you're trying to stack.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:10):**  The more stacking ability you have, the better off you're going to be.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:13):**  That's limiting you off the bat to certain crops that are physically short crops.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:17):**  You need shorter growth cycle crops because the more turns you can have, the more you  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:20):**  can generate from an economic perspective.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:24):**  Now you're looking at a bucket of things like leafy greens and lettuces.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:27):**  You're looking at herbs.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:28):**  You're looking at strawberries and certain berries.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:31):**  You're limited to this pool of crops that you can grow.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:35):**  Then you need to look at the unit of economics.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:37):**  It's expensive to operate in an indoor facility because you're running things like lighting  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:41):**  almost 24-7.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:42):**  If you take a picture of economics, now you're looking at high margin items.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:46):**  Now you're still stuck in this bucket of herbs, lettuces, and potentially berries and strawberries.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:53):**  That's a small pool.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:09:56):**  If you look at things like corn, wheat, soy, those are commodity crops.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:00):**  They're really cheap to produce.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:02):**  You can do it in mass and you can do it pretty well outdoors.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:06):**  There's no real reason to bring that production indoors.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:10):**  At the same time, I'd say there's no real reason to look at lettuce production in Salinas  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:13):**  and say that that's the correct way to do it.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:15):**  I think what you'll see is you'll start to see crops that can be grown to the quality  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:20):**  and cost of conventional or better start to move indoors if it makes sense to do that.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:26):**  Greenhouses can grow pretty much anything.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:29):**  It's just about economics at this point because you can have soil production and grow corn  
**[0:10:34-0:10:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:34):**  in a greenhouse.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:35):**  It doesn't make economic sense to do that.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:37):**  You probably wouldn't do that.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:39):**  If you can find a crop that works economically within these facilities and you can do that  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:44):**  sustainably, economically, and meet the quality and safely, actually, and if you can meet  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:50):**  the food safety demand, I'd say there's probably no reason to grow that anywhere but indoors.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:56):**  I think it'll be a piece of the puzzle.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:10:59):**  I'm not a believer that it's the end all, do you all?  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:01):**  I don't know that there is one in our agricultural system.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:04):**  I'm curious too about the types of farmers.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:08):**  One of the arguments that I've heard made for the growth of indoor farming is anyone  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:12):**  can be a farmer and you can farm in a city or you can supplement more conventional farming  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:16):**  with an indoor system.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:17):**  It broadens not only the type of crops and the margin and economics that you can get,  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:22):**  but also who is a farmer and who will be a farmer in the future.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:26):**  What's your view or what evidence do you have so far of who are the farmers of the future,  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:32):**  especially in the indoor space?  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:34):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:36):**  I think a few things about this, actually.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:38):**  I think that's true to some degree, but I'll also argue against it.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:42):**  One of the beautiful things about indoor ag is that it's a contained picture.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:47):**  You're limiting your risk to some degree on so many things.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:50):**  You're limiting the risk on weather.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:52):**  You're limiting the risk on a lot of financial...  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:54):**  In some regards, a lot of the financial risk.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:11:56):**  You're taking some of the risk of conventional ag down, primarily weather and stability of  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:02):**  forecasts and year-round production.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:05):**  You can produce year-round without the weather implications.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:08):**  That inherently makes it attractive.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:11):**  When you start to think about the unit economics, if you can see 30%, 40%, 50% margins as opposed  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:18):**  to 4% or 5% margins, then that becomes an economically attractive picture.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:23):**  You are seeing a lot of people with non-conventional farming background getting into the indoor  
**[0:12:28-0:12:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:28):**  farming space.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:29):**  You're seeing...  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:30):**  We were just talking about this actually earlier with the group because two of their farms  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:33):**  are run by former Wall Street folks who wanted to have a career transition.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:39):**  Their parents were in farming.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:40):**  They were actually in one with the farming, one was in ranching.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:43):**  They wanted to get back into the ag space, but they didn't want to do it in the way their  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:46):**  parents did it.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:47):**  So, InfraAg has made it a really attractive opportunity for them because they understood  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:52):**  what they were doing.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:53):**  They knew how to run a business.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:54):**  They understood the economics.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:12:55):**  They had this ag background where they could actually get in and operate successfully.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:13:01):**  We do see that a lot.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:13:02):**  We see a lot of career transitions from one space to another.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:13:05):**  We see a lot of people in the manufacturing or distribution spaces who come into the space,  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:13:09):**  which tends to make a little bit of sense.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:13:11):**  More farmers is generally a good thing, but farming, whether indoor or out, is not exactly  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:13:17):**  easy.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:13:19):**  Where I'd almost say the flip side of this is I think there's a deep emphasis on how  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:13:25):**  difficult it really is to operate a farm and that you're still dealing with all of the  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:13:31):**  biological systems coupled with manufacturing and distribution practices and the pricing  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:13:36):**  volatility of different markets.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:13:40):**  This deep emphasis is problematic because you're having people who risk it all by getting  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:13:44):**  into an incredibly capital-intensive industry without necessarily a market plan or without  
**[0:13:48-0:13:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:13:48):**  the understanding of the biological components.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:13:50):**  That, to me, is really scary, actually, to look at the picture as a whole if you back  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:13:56):**  up and you try and understand who's getting into the space and how it can grow.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:00):**  I think there's an interesting thing here because you can have people getting into the  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:05):**  space that aren't necessarily coming from conventional backgrounds, but I'd be wary  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:09):**  of doing it if you don't have an understanding of how difficult it is to farm and really  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:13):**  focus on how to take some of those growing risks away.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:18):**  One of the really interesting parts of indoor farming is that there are many different business  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:22):**  models.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:23):**  Some companies are selling the whole farm.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:26):**  Some are selling a branded product like lettuce, microgreens, or even cannabis.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:31):**  And some are selling enabling technologies like lighting or management software.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:37):**  With this combination of ag and tech comes a lot of complexity.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:40):**  Yeah, I mean, if you look at the conventional space, go to an ag conference, right?  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:44):**  And the first thing that you're going to see is you're going to see a breakdown of grower  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:47):**  versus grower-shipper versus packer.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:49):**  There's different...and every indoor facility is almost trying to do all of those things  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:54):**  in one.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:55):**  You're trying to grow, package, merchandise, sell, and it's really, really hard.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:14:59):**  And it's a perishable crop, so you can't get it wrong, which is challenging.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:15:03):**  You can't hold on to the crop like a commodity and wait for the best pricing.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:15:07):**  You're selling when you have it or it's gone, which is really interesting.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:15:11):**  And there's a good and bad side to this, but these are much smaller facilities.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:15:16):**  You're not talking about hundreds and hundreds of acres.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:15:19):**  You're talking about...a lot of times you're talking about under an acre and then there  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:15:23):**  are 100-acre farms.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:15:25):**  But these aren't the thousands and thousands and hundreds of thousands of acres of farms  
**[0:15:29-0:15:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:15:29):**  that we see in the Midwest in the US.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:15:31):**  And so that enables us to do some of those things.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:15:35):**  But one of the interesting things I've seen is, as you get smaller on the scale, you're  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:15:39):**  doing more things, which is almost the opposite of what anybody who runs the business would  
**[0:15:44-0:15:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:15:44):**  want to do.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:15:45):**  You have a 10,000 square foot facility who's doing growing, packing, shipping, merchandising,  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:15:50):**  branding, and selling.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:15:52):**  And then you have 100-acre facilities that are just selling tomato transplants to other  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:15:56):**  growers who finish off the rest of the product packaging and whatnot.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:00):**  So I think it's really interesting if you look at the scale and size as well, because  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:05):**  it seems to me qualitatively that the small farms are actually taking a lot of the responsibility  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:11):**  of doing the full sort of see-through through consumption, which is just interesting as  
**[0:16:16-0:16:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:16):**  a business center.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:18):**  Another big difference in indoor farming is that some of these businesses have been able  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:22):**  to attract venture capital.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:24):**  But is VC actually a good fit?  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:26):**  And if not, what are the other options?  
**[0:16:28-0:16:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:29):**  So I think there's a few things here too.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:32):**  So one, I feel like a lot of farms are going after the wrong types of capital.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:35):**  So I am not a believer that farms that operate and sell produce at business models should  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:42):**  be seeking venture capital.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:43):**  I just think it's the wrong type of capital for these operations.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:46):**  These are long payback, long ROI cycle projects that are much like the solar industry, much  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:53):**  like infrastructure projects where a debt capital or a project financing model works  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:56):**  much better.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:16:57):**  So I think that a lot of growers, what we see is these small one-off, one-farm, 10,000-square-foot  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:17:03):**  facilities that are trying to raise venture capital because it's an expensive endeavor.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:17:07):**  And I think that that's problematic.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:17:08):**  And I think having a lot of press around farms getting access to this capital is also problematic  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:17:13):**  because everyone thinks that they should do that.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:17:16):**  The second thing is that if you then go to the debt side and you say, okay, well, these  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:17:19):**  farms should be seeking debt capital, then you have to look at what types of rates and  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:17:25):**  accessibility that there is on the debt side.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:17:29):**  And for most banks, you need to have operated for three years in order to get access alone,  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:17:35):**  or you need to have some type of operating history.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:17:36):**  Well, the problem with Inverag is actually the capital intensive nature of the initial  
**[0:17:41-0:17:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:17:41):**  build-out.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:17:42):**  So now you're saying to a farmer that they have to come in with a million dollars, $2  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:17:46):**  million to build a facility, and they have to fund the working capital.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:17:51):**  And then by the year two or three, maybe they can start refinancing and paying back on old  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:17:56):**  loans.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:17:57):**  And that is a pretty big sell for most people.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:18:02):**  And so I think that one of the interesting things in this industry is going to be the  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:18:06):**  evolution of how capital sees these assets.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:18:08):**  And I would throw money at the idea that there's going to be innovation in financing models  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:18:15):**  that are focused in on capital intensive upfront and higher working capital projects that have  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:18:21):**  a long ROI but are still profitable and are going to have a good return.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:18:25):**  It's just a longer term horizon.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:18:26):**  And you're going to see some of the folks that are used to investing in infrastructure  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:18:30):**  projects to actually start coming into this space over the next few years.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:18:35):**  Back when I spoke with Allison, they had just released a report on the state of indoor farming.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:18:39):**  It's linked in the show notes if you want to have a look.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:18:41):**  I asked Allison what she learned from doing this report or anything that surprised her  
**[0:18:46-0:18:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:18:46):**  in the results.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:18:47):**  So one of the things that we asked was we asked growers to quantify what they thought  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:18:51):**  was the most underhyped and overhyped technologies being talked about in the space right now.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:18:57):**  And the most underhyped was AI or the thing they were most excited about was AI and automation,  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:02):**  or specifically in the automation side, not necessarily in the AI side.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:05):**  And then the thing that they thought was most overhyped was container farming and the container  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:10):**  farming technologies.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:11):**  And immediately when we were doing the analysis on the...  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:16):**  And we didn't provide, by the way, we didn't provide any examples of things they could  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:19):**  put in there.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:20):**  They answered that as a blank slate and something like 80% of people answered container farming  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:25):**  for overhyped.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:27):**  And so one of the things that was really interesting was one, how many people felt aligned on that.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:32):**  I think when you ask open-ended questions, oftentimes you just get a full spectrum of  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:36):**  random answers.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:37):**  So everyone seems to be pretty aligned on those two things.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:40):**  But two, it sort of isn't aligned necessarily with the way that the media or investors are  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:48):**  thinking about the space.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:49):**  And so you think, you step back and say, hey, why is this and why is this surprising to  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:54):**  me?  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:55):**  And then when you realize, when you think about it and you realize, oh, well, the people  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:19:59):**  who are answering the survey are commercial farmers, are commercial indoor operators.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:20:03):**  And so, yeah, it would make sense to me that this would be something that they would maybe  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:20:08):**  feel would be overhyped because it hasn't been proven out yet.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:20:12):**  And it's not something that they would be implementing on the farm.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:20:14):**  And it's not something that they necessarily see valuable.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:20:17):**  And so maybe the broader ecosystem loves this idea.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:20:20):**  But to the farmers answering the survey, it falls out of place.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:20:24):**  And similar from automation perspective, we can talk about how much it's overhyped in  
**[0:20:27-0:20:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:20:27):**  the industry a lot right now.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:20:29):**  But to farmers, automation could be the difference between spending millions of dollars every  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:20:33):**  year in labor and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in labor, which could mean the  
**[0:20:37-0:20:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:20:37):**  difference between a 40 percent margin and a 20 percent margin.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:20:47):**  In addition to being an entrepreneur and the leader of her company, Allison is a leader  
**[0:20:51-0:20:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:20:51):**  in the industry, championing topics she's passionate about and driving change in agriculture.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:20:58):**  I wanted to kind of change directions, Allison, and ask you recently you actually kind of  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:21:03):**  how we connected, although I knew you were and had been hoping to chat with you for a  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:21:08):**  while.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:21:09):**  On Twitter, you posted a list of women in agtech that you wanted to hear speaking at  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:21:18):**  conferences.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:21:19):**  And that turned into a bit of a, I guess, viral movement where you ended up making a  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:21:23):**  big Google Doc of women in agtech and sort of calling out the fact that there are women  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:21:28):**  innovating in this space and that they should be more well represented, especially at conferences.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:21:32):**  I wanted to ask you what made you start doing that and then what's been your reaction or  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:21:39):**  opinion on how this has kind of blown up?  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:21:41):**  Did you expect that to happen and what kind of come of it from your perspective?  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:21:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:21:46):**  I mean, I only did this really to go viral.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:21:48):**  I'm just kidding.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:21:49):**  It's actually the opposite.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:21:50):**  I've always been pretty quiet about these types of things.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:21:53):**  I was raised in a way that was, you're not a step back, but you're always going to fight  
**[0:22:00-0:22:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:00):**  to win, essentially.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:03):**  And that's how I drive a lot of my mentality around these types of things was when we raised  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:07):**  our first round of financing, I always give this example.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:11):**  Back when we were raising that round, I think the average number of partner meetings that  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:15):**  a man had to pitch in order to get a seed round of the size that we had was something  
**[0:22:19-0:22:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:19):**  around like 20, 25 people.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:21):**  We pitched over 80 or I pitched over 80 in order to get the same sort of size rounds.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:27):**  And that's something that, again, I didn't look at that as a disadvantage necessarily.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:31):**  Instead, I understood the challenge and I went into it saying, okay, I know that I'm  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:35):**  going to have to pitch 4X the amount of people, but I'm going to do that.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:38):**  I'm going to do it because I'm going to win and I'm going to get the financing I need  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:42):**  to carry this business through.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:43):**  And so that's always been the sort of attitude I've taken.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:46):**  And I used to avoid a lot of panels where I was asked to speak about being a woman in  
**[0:22:50-0:22:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:50):**  the tech industry or being a woman in ag.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:53):**  And it was funny because it all sort of culminated at this point where I speak at a lot of conferences  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:22:58):**  and I'm asked to participate at all events.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:01):**  And one of the interesting things is if you look around the room, you'd think that there  
**[0:23:05-0:23:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:05):**  were no women in ag or ag tech.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:07):**  And that's just not the case.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:09):**  I get the pleasure of working with so many women, especially on the ag research side  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:15):**  and the big ag side, who are senior leaders of these organizations that are doing real  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:19):**  meaningful work and on the ag tech side, who are founding companies that are doing really  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:23):**  interesting and meaningful things.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:26):**  And so I kept saying, well, why is this happening?  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:28):**  Why are women being asked to speak?  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:31):**  And it's either you can look at it as a pipeline problem or you can look at it as a network  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:35):**  problem or you can look at it as a combination.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:37):**  But something was happening that was breaking the system for me.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:40):**  And frankly, I don't want to be involved in things that just don't have other people that  
**[0:23:45-0:23:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:45):**  I want to learn from.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:46):**  I don't want to go into a room and have the same people at the same event talking about  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:51):**  the same things, the same perspective, because it's not worth my time or energy to do that.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:55):**  And it's even for me, too.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:56):**  If I'm asked to speak at every single event, that's the same thing.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:23:59):**  It's just that I'm not the audience member in that case.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:01):**  Somebody else is getting that same experience.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:03):**  And it's really, really it's not valuable at all.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:07):**  And so I was sitting back and I had this event organized that was organized in what's coming  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:12):**  up.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:13):**  And they sent me an invite to sponsor the event, not speak at the event, sponsor the  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:17):**  event.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:18):**  And I looked at the list and it was about 90 percent, the speaker list was about 90  
**[0:24:23-0:24:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:23):**  percent white male.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:25):**  And the rest of it was either people of color, it was men, people of color.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:31):**  And so it was all men, 100 percent, not one woman on this list.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:37):**  It was 30 or 40 speakers and a very, very, very limited minority of people of color.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:44):**  And so I just got pretty frustrated.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:45):**  I was sitting there in the afternoon.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:47):**  This is really annoying to me.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:49):**  I want to see more women.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:50):**  I want to go to an event with people that look different and have different experiences  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:56):**  and understand different things.  
**[0:24:57-0:24:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:57):**  And diversity is important.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:24:58):**  It's not just a buzzword.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:00):**  And this is annoying to me.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:02):**  And so I just tweeted a list of women that I know personally that I wanted, that I'd  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:08):**  love to have the opportunity to go see, listen to.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:12):**  And it did blow up a little bit.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:13):**  It was very interesting.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:15):**  I wasn't really expecting it, albeit I guess it is a good time to be a woman and talking  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:20):**  about being a woman right now.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:21):**  So I think we have, you know, there's that going for us right now.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:25):**  But I think one of the interesting reactions was immediately after posting it, and we shared,  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:29):**  so I shared 75 women, I think, and then shared a Google spreadsheet.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:34):**  And now it's almost 400 women because people have just been continuously adding to it,  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:38):**  which I think is beautiful and wonderful and is exactly what should happen.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:42):**  And I had, and so the interesting thing to me was I had a few events that wrote in to  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:47):**  me probably within 48 hours who said, you know, I'm organizing this event.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:52):**  It's typically been 80% men and we want to change that and we need help, or it's been  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:56):**  90% men and we need help changing that.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:25:59):**  Thank you for posting this.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:00):**  I'm going through it now.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:01):**  Would you make interest to X, Y, and Z people?  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:03):**  And that to me is like the dream because it's really easy for somebody to put a list together,  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:09):**  in my opinion.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:10):**  But, you know, it starts to show that there's this network problem.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:12):**  There's a problem that event organizers may not know about women being out there or these  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:17):**  women specifically or any women and maybe just don't care.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:23):**  And so they don't pay attention to it until somebody calls them out.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:25):**  And I think that's what happened.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:27):**  And so I think the event organizers thing has been interesting.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:31):**  We one of the other things that's been really interesting is we've had two of our investors  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:36):**  who are like, we need to do better at this and we need your help doing it.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:40):**  And I don't think it's necessarily fair to put the burden on me or any of the, like any  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:43):**  individual in general, but it is interesting to see that they want to do something about  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:48):**  it.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:49):**  So I think there's things that are starting to happen, which feels good.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:52):**  I don't think events are the only challenge.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:53):**  I think, especially on the tech side, you know, access to capital and those other challenges  
**[0:26:57-0:26:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:57):**  need to be addressed as well.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:26:59):**  But events felt like something I was doing every day.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:01):**  And that's why that's why it frustrated me.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:04):**  Have you gotten any like negative pushback or like reverse or people saying like, oh,  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:09):**  this, I don't know, one pushback I could imagine is, and I've definitely felt this, like, I  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:13):**  don't want to be asked to speak because I'm a woman.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:15):**  I want to be asked to speak because I'm a great speaker.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:18):**  And so does that like, are there, what's your response to that?  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:21):**  And have there been any other maybe slightly more negative or resistant pushback to this  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:26):**  movement?  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:27):**  Yeah, I mean, I agree with that.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:28):**  I actually think it's a total cop out to ask any woman to be a moderator just so that you  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:32):**  can have women involved or to speak on a panel about diversity if they're not diversity experts.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:37):**  I try my hardest to say no to things that I don't feel like I'm an expert in.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:42):**  So, you know, I'm happy to talk about raising capital.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:45):**  I'm happy to talk about I tech.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:46):**  I'm happy to talk about your ag.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:47):**  I'm happy to talk about building a team in New York and I just talk about many things  
**[0:27:52-0:27:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:52):**  that I'm doing and that I feel like I contribute to.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:55):**  Just because I'm a woman does not make me an expert in diversity.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:27:59):**  And in fact, it's something that I've been intentionally tripped about and trying to  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:28:04):**  navigate around myself, but it's not something that I'm an expert in.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:28:07):**  And there are plenty of people who are.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:28:08):**  So if the, you know, if the intention is to have a panel about diversity in an industry,  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:28:13):**  I would always advocate to bring on experts in that topic.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:28:18):**  And frankly, it's not an ego thing.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:28:19):**  I want to be asked to think about something I'm an expert in because that's the thing  
**[0:28:22-0:28:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:28:22):**  that's going to be the most useful for the people that are listening.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:28:25):**  You don't really want me talking about hockey because I'm not a hockey expert.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:28:30):**  In terms of negative pushback, I've heard incredibly humorous things to me.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:28:36):**  But yeah, I mean, we get there was there was tons of I would say most of the feedback was  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:28:41):**  overwhelmingly positive, but there are there's a lot of people, especially in ads, feel like  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:28:47):**  most of the feedback, I guess that's negative, is around the idea that, well, if women aren't  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:28:52):**  representative in the industry, then why would we ask them to be panelists type of a thing?  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:28:56):**  So the overwhelming majority of farm owners in the United States are men.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:29:00):**  And so if you're doing a conference about farm ownership specifically, then most people  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:29:05):**  feel a lot of the pushback around this as an example would be something that people  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:29:10):**  would say, you know, well, farm owners are men.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:29:12):**  So why would we ask women to participate?  
**[0:29:15-0:29:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:29:15):**  And I think that that too is a bit of, you know, that's a bit of just being naive.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:29:22):**  One, yes, the majority of farm ownership is male right now.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:29:26):**  But there are women, you know, women are leading the way in terms of research and higher education,  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:29:31):**  and they're coming out with advanced degrees in research and biology and plant physiology  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:29:35):**  and genomics.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:29:37):**  And when you think about the tech industry as a whole in the States, you know, the people  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:29:41):**  that are leading the research side are women.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:29:44):**  And when you think about the people, you know, when you think about big ag and you think  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:29:47):**  about the seed companies and the nutrient companies, there are tons of women in high  
**[0:29:51-0:29:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:29:51):**  leadership positions.  
**[0:29:53-0:30:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:29:53):**  Allison sees two big issues preventing gender diversity, pipeline and networks.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:30:00):**  When I think about representation in industries in general, when I think about tech CEOs or  
**[0:30:04-0:30:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:30:04):**  panels or employees, I want to see that be more representative of our population.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:30:11):**  And so, you know, that requires two things being fixed.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:30:14):**  It requires a pipeline issue being alleviated.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:30:17):**  So trying to reduce the challenges of access to capital for tech CEOs who maybe are women,  
**[0:30:24-0:30:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:30:24):**  but also maybe haven't our first time founders or aren't in the Bay Area.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:30:27):**  There's a lot of different challenges there that make this a pipeline problem of diversity  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:30:30):**  or diversity pipeline problem, and also a network problem.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:30:35):**  And this is, you know, simple things like the list.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:30:37):**  The idea was, if you don't know enough women to ask to get a gender diverse panel, then  
**[0:30:43-0:30:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:30:43):**  here are some you can ask.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:30:44):**  And, you know, it's not meant to be a condescending thing.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:30:47):**  It's meant to be a, you know what, if we don't have a universal list that you go to to find  
**[0:30:51-0:30:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:30:51):**  people, here's one.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:30:52):**  If you don't know who to call to ask somebody, you know, if you don't know who to call, call  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:30:56):**  somebody on this list and they'll help you figure out who you might be able to reach  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:00):**  out to.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:01):**  And that is like the first step to me in terms of how do you break down the network barriers.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:06):**  Yeah, I totally agree.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:07):**  I think we I think that is a great step towards it.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:10):**  And just like raising the awareness is the first step.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:12):**  And then there's lots of different paths people can take from there.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:15):**  And even just on the sort of vast majority of farmers are men.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:18):**  While definitely true, I would argue like a lot of the farmers I talk to fully see the  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:24):**  importance of having their wives in that farming system and whether it's running the books  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:28):**  or otherwise and think of it as a farming team and a farming family.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:32):**  And so I think it's, you know, probably misses some of the points, even that stat about the  
**[0:31:37-0:31:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:37):**  number of farmers who are men.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:39):**  One of the interesting things I'll just add to that, though, is that there is this changing  
**[0:31:42-0:31:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:42):**  dynamic of who is a farmer.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:43):**  You know, you asked us earlier about the indoor farming space and I answered via profession,  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:49):**  but you're also seeing a dynamic shift of who is a farmer.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:53):**  We I mean, we're working with over 150 some odd customer growers around the world.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:31:59):**  And I say probably I think 40 close to 40 percent are women owned women operated farms.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:32:05):**  So that's a very different number than ranching or commodities or whatever it may be.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:32:11):**  But it's an interesting picture to look at as we start thinking, OK, how is farming changing  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:32:15):**  and then who is a farmer or what is the concept of a farmer is starting to shift a little  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:32:21):**  bit.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:32:23):**  Very much so.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:32:24):**  And actually, I'm seeing the same thing, but on the opposite side.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:32:27):**  So we've been running an authentic program for farmer entrepreneurs.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:32:31):**  So producers who raised their hand and wanted to go on the start up journey because they  
**[0:32:35-0:32:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:32:35):**  have an idea or a burning pain point that they want to solve.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:32:38):**  And that both of the cohorts we've run so far, very small sample size, but has been  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:32:42):**  much more close to sort of gender balance, sort of more of like a 40, 45 percent female  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:32:47):**  self selecting to be entrepreneurs coming from the producer and ag community.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:32:51):**  So starting to see that change on that side as well, which I think is really exciting  
**[0:32:56-0:32:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:32:56):**  and interesting.  
**[0:32:57-0:32:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:32:57):**  That's very cool.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:32:58):**  Well, thanks so much for joining us.

**[0:33:06-0:33:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:33:06):**  or otherwise.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:33:07):**  We're both panelists.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=597281#t=0:33:08):**  That's right.

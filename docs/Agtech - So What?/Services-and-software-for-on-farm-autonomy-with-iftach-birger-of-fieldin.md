### Agtech - So What?  (2022-00-04)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agbenthic Group.  I'm Sarah Nolet.  Autonomous equipment has come a long way in a relatively short period of time, and the  benefits it promises, especially in high labor sectors like specialty crops, are pretty huge.  But between the almost completely manual present and a nearly or fully autonomous future, there  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:22):**  is a very messy middle.  And that could complicate the picture for companies looking to win in this space.  We already living in the mixed fleet world.  All our data is coming from a mixed fleet.  The mixed fleet will be, some of them will be autonomous and some of them not.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:38):**  And some of them will be of this company and some of them will be autonomous of this company.  So autonomy is a mean to an end.  And I know it will be commodity.  The winner will not be autonomous solution.  That's Iftak Berger, co-founder and COO at FieldIn, a farm data and autonomous equipment  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:56):**  startup based in Israel.  Iftak's experience with FieldIn offers some valuable insight, not only on how the autonomous  sector might shape up, but also on SaaS models in agriculture.  He also shares some excellent stories on building a company outside your biggest market and  how to meet your first international customers.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:13):**  But first, we'll learn a bit more about FieldIn and about Iftak's journey.  He was born and raised on one of the largest specialty crop farms in Israel, where he did  everything from the most basic tasks to managing the whole operation and even launching an  olive oil business alongside the farm.  From there, he got a master's in plant science and while doing his coursework, met his now  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:32):**  co-founder who had deeper experience in tech and entrepreneurship, though much less direct  experience in ag.  In a case of what Iftak describes as perfect timing, they decided to just start and they  had a vision for a transformative company from the get go.  So our basically mission didn't change since we started the company.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:51):**  From day one, our mission was to provide high value crops growers with data to better manage  their day to day operation, to become more efficient and accurate in every activity they  are doing in the farm.  So it's the same mission, like we are focusing on this specific goal of the high value crops  grower.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:02:13):**  Just to be clear, when I'm talking about high value crop grower, I'm talking about crops  that are more than $2,000 per acre on the production costs.  So it's more about the trees, it's about the high value crops, it's the food that we are  eating, what we are buying in the supermarket is the vegetables and it's the tree fruits,  apples, almonds, nuts.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:02:35):**  This part of the farming is a part that always suffer from less technologies because the  big companies focus like the John Deere of the world, Case New Orleans, the pesticide  companies, they're focused on the broad acre, on the big acreage crop like the corn and  the soy, et cetera.  And the high value crop that is more specific always add less technology, although they  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:04):**  are very sophisticated growers because they are growing stuff that is very hard to grow.  The cost of mistake can be very high in high value crops, but again, it's about focus.  So there is the big companies never focused on that.  So we felt that this is the place that will embarrass our technology in the best way.  They also have higher willingness to pay, right?  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:26):**  Because of the value of the crops, you can charge more for the services.  I imagine that had a role as well.  Exactly.  And there is a loss.  And another big thing about high value crops, they are not a commodity.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:41):**  So the meaning that the earnings, like the margins are basically based on their performance  because commodity, it's not always about you.  You can never like, I don't know, something that happened in some other place in the world  and then the price of drop.  With the high value crops, the good growers, their wins are bigger.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:06):**  Tell me a little bit more about the journey of getting to where you are today.  Any failures, any pivots, any mistakes along the way that you're able to share?  Yeah, mistakes.  Mistakes are happening every day in startup just to be fully transparent.  But the journey, yeah, it started.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:22):**  So we started in Israel and Israel is it's a small growers compared to the world, to  the growers that now we are working in.  The meaning is that the average size of a grower is probably will be around the hundred  acres.  And these growers have a different mentality than the big growers.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:39):**  Currently, our minimum, we work with commercial growers because our product is focusing on  helping big operations.  But when we started, we didn't, we focused on the smallest.  We still have a lot of clients in Israel.  So there are still clients of field and there are still small growers.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:56):**  But if I think about, it's not a mistake, but something that we can do faster is to  come faster to the US or to your main market because we were staying in Israel for years  before we put our first, we call from the first client in the US.  And when you are finding the first client, then the acceleration of your company is really  starting because until then you are building a product.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:20):**  By the way, it's not that the product was 180 degree different, but it's not the same  product.  So if I can give like a tip for a young entrepreneur, they need to accelerate their time to get  to the real market that they are looking for, because this is the only way to check your  product market fit and really investing in the right thing.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:40):**  But if I come back to the journey, we've done that for years in Israel, we developed the  product.  We very fast came into capture basically all the markets.  Like I think after two years, like we was like, we work with all the relevant growers  in Israel, all of the relevant acres.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:57):**  And then in 2017, we started our journey in the US with one of the biggest animal growers  in the world.  When you decided to come to California, did you just show up?  Did you call growers?  Did you get pulled in by customers?  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:14):**  Like how did you actually get to California and getting that first client?  Was it a relationship you had or tell us the story of that first client?  So we probably had a very good product market fit because we've been in a conference in  San Francisco.  And basically this goal came to us directly and tell us that you need our solution because  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:34):**  he heard about us.  And we just started and just to be clear, this is the biggest goal in the world, the  goal that came to us.  So it was to be honest, more lucky than we were.  Right place, right time.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:47):**  Yeah, we was planning to walk in the States, but again, I think that they come to us, they  heard about us and they said that they heard about our solution and they needed it.  It was like a spring solution, like to help them to better manage their spring operations.  It is a very expensive and complex thing to manage when you are a big grower.  So this was our first step.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:07:12):**  It helped us a lot to work with this grower because we tested with him.  And then we started to get more and more clients over in California, in the Central Valley.  And once we are working with them, also our valuable position was go with them because  one of the biggest things that you can do as a, as in, when the company is listening  to your clients, because, and, and, and I would say something I done basically every  
**[0:07:38-0:07:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:07:38):**  like everything in elements when I was young, like I, I know how to do it yet your clients  know always better than you, what they need.  Now you need to listen exactly, it's not that everything that they are saying is exactly  how you need to make your product.  But if you listen carefully and you understand the pain points, this is the main thing, then  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:08:01):**  you can evolve the product.  So when we started, we provided like a spring solution, like a platform to help you better  manage your spring operation, like closing the pest management cycle from scouting, from  looking for the pest or for the disease, make the recommendation and then actual spring,  measure it and close the loop.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:08:23):**  And we evolve with that into a smart farm.  So basically in the last three years, we provide a full smart farm solution that basically  cover all the operation in the farm.  So we are measuring every mechanical activity that's happening in the farm from checking  irrigation liquid with your ATVs up to measure how many seconds you're shaking every tree  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:08:49):**  and of course spraying and mowing and every other activity.  So basically we provide a one-stop-stop solution to manage all your operation in the farm.  That also lead us to the autonomy solutions that this is like the next generation of what  we are working on.  Do you have an example of that challenge of listening to your customers?  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:12):**  Like when they say they want one thing, but when you actually watch how they operate or  see how it works in the field, you realize that what they're saying isn't exactly what  they want.  It needs to manifest in a slightly different way.  I think about something that I hear a lot from growers that I agree in eye level on  
**[0:09:29-0:09:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:29):**  that.  And growers, they always say that they want one stop shop, one solution, that everything  will be on it.  Now they're right in the concept of that, but this is not what they need.  It's not about the one stop.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:43):**  They just need seamlessly operating systems that basically will help them to utilize basically  every technology that they can implement in the farm in a way that will make one plus  one equal to three.  The meaning is that two systems need to, if they can, bring the data to the one place  that they can take the decision.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:08):**  Do you think that it's not what they want or not what they need, or is it just hard  to build?  In the current ecosystem, it's hard to build.  I think that in the long run, this is what will happen.  By the way, this is what we are aiming to do.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:21):**  And again, it's not about the one stop shop.  It's about the ability to utilize technology like your phone, right?  You don't care what's happening on every app, what's on the backend, et cetera.  But once you have app, you have operating systems that running everything on that, it's  make your life easier, right?  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:39):**  It's easy access.  So in the end, it's very complex to be a grower, right?  Because let's face it, it's not depend, a lot of stuff not depend on you.  And it's pretty crazy to a business.  There is a climate change and there is a weather events that they cannot control.  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:57):**  There is no label.  They have a label shortage.  You don't have employee to run the machine.  They don't have water.  They don't say they have water.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:11:07):**  It's very expensive.  The pesticides, et cetera, it's so expensive.  In this world, I believe that they need access to the best in-class technologies and the  ability to really work with these technologies.  One of the challenges, right?  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:11:21):**  It's easy to strive for the iPhone experience.  And yet the total addressable market for the iPhone is much larger than the total addressable  market for an integrated data sharing solution in agriculture, because you've got, like you  said, differences in each market differences in the size of the growers differences in  different crops and the needs and then seasonally.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:11:43):**  So the challenge that you guys face, I would imagine is how do we balance the desire for  this streamlined all in one experience with the fact that there are many different sub  markets and winning in them all is actually quite expensive.  So do you ever get into nuanced conversations about the difference between like a one-stop  shop or we need this magical dashboard where everything is integrated versus the, what  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:12:09):**  we're actually talking about here is interoperability or what we're actually talking about is how  the data is flowing.  Do you get into the differences in how you might achieve one-stop shop or do growers  not really care?  So the way that we look into the, there is instead of one one-stop shop, there is two  
**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:12:27):**  way stop stops.  What is the meaning there is a agronomic platform and there is operational platform, agronomic  platform.  It's companies in our market like Simios, if you're there about them or fight eggs that  they are like, try to bring a lot of agronomic data into one place and have them to take  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:12:46):**  decision.  And there is the operational.  The agronomy is the why we are irrigating, why we all need to spray because there is  a lot of data that they need to summarize and get to the growth, take the decision or  taking the decision for him.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:00):**  And the how is what we are doing.  This is the operational side.  For example, the why can say you have a pest, right?  Or you need to harvest now.  The how is okay.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:12):**  Now that I have this data, how I'm doing the most efficient and accurate way.  So from the first, from the get go, we are looking at only two separate platforms that  also the personas in the farm are not the same person.  The persona for the agronomy chief agronomist is this person.  And the operation is the VP operation.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:34):**  Actually it's also the CEO most of the time, the companies, because the majority of fact  farming is doing is operational, right?  There is a decision and then a lot of machines and people that need to do something based  on the decisions it was taking on the agronomy.  So on this side of the operation, yes, this is where we are seeing ourself as a one-stop  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:53):**  shop.  So we are working for example with other companies also, and we connect sense of other companies  that connect to our solution.  For example, a gate controllers for sprayers.  We are not developing every algorithm in the world.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:14:08):**  We just want to provide to the growth the ability to utilize the best in class technology  to be more accurate and efficient in the day to day operation.  We also connecting, for example, if we look to the autonomous part, we are not seeing  ourself as the only autonomous solution provider in the world.  The opposite, we are seeing ourself as a company that will provide the recommendation and what  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:14:33):**  to do to the autonomous machines that we drive in the farm based on our operating system,  because we have the data that capture of, okay, this is what needs to be done.  We need to spray this block with this gallon per acre and this field, et cetera, et cetera.  Now it's only a task that we'll send to an autonomous vehicle or it could be also our  autonomous vehicle because we are also building retrofit kits that's sitting on tractors,  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:14:58):**  but it's part of the operational ecosystem, if it makes sense.  It makes sense to me that you guys would start in tracking and recording on the operational  side, because then you can understand where there's low hanging fruit for autonomy, like  where you can actually automate.  Is that how you thought about it?  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:14):**  Like let's monitor and capture the data and then let's see where we can actually introduce  autonomy to take out labor or save cost.  Was that the plan?  Yeah.  Again, when we started the 2013 autonomy was something that you see in science fiction,  
**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:30):**  but when we started, our first thing was to provide the transparency, visibility and metrics,  because I will say, and I don't think if farming, you will see that there is a lot of data on  farming.  You will go to UC Davis or you will go to other universities around the world.  The data is agronomic data, how to grow your crop.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:53):**  There is not a lot of data of how to operate your farm.  And it's crazy, right?  You look at the multimillion dollar companies or multi-billion dollar companies, and basically  they don't have a clue what is a good shaking time, for example, for shakings.  Now I'm talking about the millions of dollars or tens million dollars they're spending only  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:14):**  on this activity.  And they don't know if they need to shake it for a second and then go to the next three  and eight seconds.  They just don't know.  They're doing that like 30, 40, 50 years the same way.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:27):**  And they don't know what is the industry benchmark for that.  What is the best practice?  So our goal was from the data is first of all to create metrics, to create data, to  create a language that everybody in the farm and the ecosystem will talk on the same metrics.  And this is what we've done.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:46):**  I think this is our biggest thing that Fielding has done to the industry.  And this is why we became so successful because we basically took something very complex and  we made it very easy because we make it to talk on very specific metrics that every grower  understand, but now they can check themselves and improve themselves and understand how  they are comparing to the industry, to what they need to do.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:09):**  So that was our first initial thing.  This was help us to help the growers to increase their coverage in a shift in a more than 25%  each shift.  Maybe they reduce their operational costs by 25%, but it wasn't enough because the label  shortage worldwide and the cost of manpower of employees is something that is on the rise  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:32):**  in California only in the last five years, the cost was up by 75%.  And also the label that there is, it's like, it's not on the same professional level like  it used to be.  So for example, you are putting somebody very new on the sprayer, on the shaker, it will  break the machine.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:52):**  It will not, it cannot do it.  So we understood that label is one of like is the biggest challenges that farmers have  worldwide and for the growth.  And when we look in there, we said, okay, autonomy is a key to solve this problem.  And we as an operate, as a company that already work with the biggest growers on the world  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:14):**  already have the data, already understand the needs.  We have a big leverage of implementing these technologies in the field.  So this is why we acquired Midnight Robotics.  How did you think about that acquisition?  Did you search the landscape and then you picked them?  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:31):**  Why?  Yeah.  Tell us about why and how that acquisition went.  Yeah.  So first of all, we look on, we look on the retrofit kit markets.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:42):**  The reason is because feeding is already have tens of thousands of sensor worldwide.  We want to see how we can take the already existing ecosystem that we have and convert  them into autonomy.  So the retrofit was fit for us.  There is autonomous companies that are built from scratch, gas sprayers or monarchs.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:19:06):**  So this is not our, what we are looking of course, in the future, we will be part of  the ecosystem.  So that is one thing.  We look on the retrofit and on the retrofit specifically, when we look on what's happened,  we saw that the Midnight guys are the most progress company in terms of algorithms and  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:19:23):**  understanding of autonomy.  It's a group of people that come from a spinoff of innovation.  This is a leading LIDAR company that IPO'd two years ago in the NASDAQ.  We saw the technology, tested the technology, and then when we see there is something that  is progress enough, then we done the acquisition.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:19:51):**  The retrofit space makes me think about an analog in another industry.  If you think of GPS units for cars, we used to go rent a car and then we would need to  buy a separate GPS unit because the car didn't have a GPS in it.  And so it was really helpful to have Garmin or whoever it was.  Now the cars just come with the GPS embedded and so we don't need to buy that extra piece.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:12):**  When do you think you'll run up against the incumbents installing their own autonomy and  therefore maybe creates a problem for the Garmin's of this world?  So the way that we are looking on that, the real revolution will come when everything  will be autonomous on the farm.  And I will explain why.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:30):**  You have employees that works on a tractor in the season, but then on the end of the  season on the harvesting, they will work on the shaker, the same person, because he work  on one type of machine and then he moves to the other part of it because this is the cycle  of labor and farming.  We are going to live, I think in the next 15 years, one five of a mixed fleet world.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:55):**  And again, it's different than the car.  The one car is the world.  In farming, the one tractor is nasty.  The swarm, the fleet is what is important because everything connected.  So we are going to live in a world of mixed fleet.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:08):**  The mixed fleet will be, some of them will be autonomous and some of them not.  And some of them will be of this company and some of them will be autonomous of this company.  Like now we are going to farm, you will see tractors of John Deere, of Case, of New Orleans  and you will see sprayers of Aerofan, of Gas and other companies and more else and harvesting  machine.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:31):**  So it's going to be a transition model.  And we, again, as a company, we are seeing ourselves as the operating system of this  revolution, not as the autonomy.  The autonomy, yes, it's going to be.  And this mixed world, we as a company, we already solved the biggest problem of digitize  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:51):**  everything.  We are already digitized.  We already living in the mixed fleet world.  All our data is coming from a mixed fleet.  So you are right, autonomy is a means to an end.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:02):**  And I know it will be commodity.  The big company, the winner will not be autonomous solution.  Because like you said, the Garmin is a tool.  It's a tool for something much bigger, go faster from one point to the next point.  Yeah, the operational complexity makes sense to me.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:21):**  And to your point about the humans, like you haven't solved the whole problem if you've  only automated one task because the farmer still has to pay for that employee to do the  other task.  So I guess that leads to another possible business model, which is to be a contract  operator and to actually work to provide the entire service.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:38):**  Did you ever consider that or other different business models?  Yeah, we can only consider it, but we are coming to serve the world, not the one company.  So in our business model is SAS.  So run a SAS model company in the agriculture world that is very unique thing.  There is not a lot of companies that are eating the SAS metric of a gross company.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:23:01):**  To start be the person that the others of employees are driving on a spray to spray,  this is sounds great on paper, but it's very hard to grow to be like a worldwide companies  being the operating system of the world.  Interesting you say that, cause I actually perceive the operating system play as also  challenging or also challenging to scale for what we were saying before about like what  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:23:29):**  works in specialty crops in California is very different than what works in specialty  crops in other markets, but also in broad acre.  And so how do you actually get to the size of market and the lower cost of customer acquisition  that can make a software model work in agriculture?  Yeah, so this is the thing, what we already built is basically something that we work  
**[0:23:53-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:23:53):**  with the majority of the crops of high value crops because the basic of tractor and what  tractor is doing is not so different between apples growers in Washington state to a urban  grower in California and to a vineyard grower in Australia.  Now it's different on the business side.  There is countries that the growers are more commercial like Australia and the US and there  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:24:19):**  is countries that the high value crops are less commercial in the way they work like  in Europe, they are a lot smaller growers.  So this is the main difference, but like in terms of how you are running the operation,  the basic of the same, there is agronomics, they take a decision and then there is tractors  going and doing that in a certain area.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:24:41):**  Am I right to understand that you guys plan to stay in high value crops or specialty that  you're not getting pressure from investors to move into bigger markets?  The high value crops is big enough that we will not need this pressure.  We already have a lot of incomes in the company.  Again, we are continue growing with metrics of Silicon Valley company, not traditional  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:25:06):**  ag sense or whatever, they have a very slow growth pace.  Now I will say that we start to work a bit on the Midwest, but it's not our main focus.  It's just was a low hanging fruit for us to try something, but we are looking in the high  value crop ecosystem is the next big thing in farming.  And I will, I think that in the next few years, you will see a lot of investment in high value  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:25:30):**  crops because autonomy, there is a time total addressable market behind it.  And it's fitting to high value crops much, much more than to broad acre because replacing  operator on a million dollar tractors that cover a thousand acres a day on the broad  acre, the value is not like to replace an operator on a small, on the swarm of 10 tractors  that cover 200 acres a day.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:25:54):**  And then you replacing 10 employees and not one that your margin are different.  So I'm pretty sure that in the next few years, there will be a huge boom on the investment  on the high value crops.  You already start to see it on the robotics.  Yeah, it's interesting.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:26:10):**  My sense is that you mentioned Semios before with the acquisition of Agworld, it would  seem that they're thinking about and need to expand into broad acre.  It would also seem that for them money is not really the issue with the kind of backing  they have.  So if they're the kind of parallel in the agronomic space to your operational space,  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:26:28):**  it seems like they're seeing the opportunity to expand into broad acre, but you don't feel  like that's going to be necessary for you guys.  Yeah.  Again, I'm not saying no, definitely.  And like I said, we already started to do it, but it's a focus of a company.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:26:43):**  We try to be the high value crops leaders in terms of be the operating system of the  high value crops grower.  What will happen in the future?  Like if there will be amazing opportunities to expand it, yes, but we are trying to serve  clients in a very focused way and you cannot do everything.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:27:04):**  And the focus point makes a lot of sense to me.  And I love what you said about the meeting your first us customer at a conference.  We see that all the time with startups who come to speak with us on the investment side.  It's like, well, I went to these three conferences and I left with 15 customers.  Look how much demand there is.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:27:20):**  That's very different than getting to a hundred or 300 or a thousand customers because those  second and third tiers of farmers aren't coming to those conferences with their hand in their  pocket ready to pay.  So you have to cross this, I guess what we would call the messy middle there.  And you're solving a different adoption problem.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:27:37):**  Any comments on how you guys have navigated that from like early adopters into more market  penetration?  You just need a good brand.  This is how I've seen this.  Farming is a big industry, but a small community.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:27:51):**  So you just need to have to do what you're saying.  Sell, execute, by the way, not, you don't need always to do exact because there is challenges  when everything is not perfect.  And anyone that will say that they come and start the technology and it's not happening.  But if you are execute, if you are boost on the ground, if you are repeatable about what  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:28:11):**  you are saying and you are acting as a pro and you're working with the growers to solving  problems and you are there when he needs you.  It happened to be honest, like it's, you don't need any, it's not, you don't need any like  a secret thing.  So the way that we've done it, by the way, we establish office in CEP Fresno, in the  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:28:31):**  central Valley.  This is where our co co company was focused.  We have employees based all around the central Valley and every place that we are walking  in, we have boost on the ground there when they need us.  And by the way, you said something very interesting about the early adopters.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:28:47):**  They have amazing clients for the start, but the main thing is the second one, because  the second one, first of all, we'd be much more loyal because early adopter try everything.  You don't really need amazing products to get to the early adopters.  It's giving you a first sign that you have something in your end, but the real thing  is the second wave is that by the way, we stay for you.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:29:06):**  If you're not going to do a lot of mistakes for you for forever, because they already  saw you, they already understand why you don't give you the confidence in you and they will  stick.  I like what you said about brand, but that credibility in the industry really matters.  It also sounds the like the tactics you're using, having boots on the ground and being  
**[0:29:26-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:29:26):**  your customers is pretty expensive.  Is there a trade off there?  You know, doing business is expensive thing, but you know, it's about building your business  model.  We don't think that the technology, it's only the IP of the technology.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:29:43):**  We are seeing technology as something much more old, like big, like you have customer  success, grow success.  This is a major part of our product.  This is our thing.  This is like a tool for the growers to be successful.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:29:57):**  Yeah, it's like our techs, our tech team, it's part of our solution.  So we are looking at maybe differently than other tech companies, but we are seeing software  as a service.  The service is part of that.  It's not only the software and the services bring everything.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:30:14):**  You see that as a differentiator.  If you're speaking with a customer that, and they're evaluating multiple products, cause  I imagine again, once you move from early adopters into more of the mainstream customers,  they, and the market is advancing.  There's more competitors for you.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:30:29):**  The growers are comparing you to other solutions and they have to decide if they pick you or  if they pick someone else is service why they pick you or are there other reasons?  Yeah, I think it's not only that we have a good brand.  We don't have a lot of competition to be perfectly honest.  There is, but they are not the direct, they don't have our value proposition.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:30:50):**  And yes, I think that our goal is speaking in their language.  It's always going to be, by the way, a local people, person that from this area, and by  the way, there is another thing that's happening in farming.  There is so many white elephants, like companies that came and go and growers still have a  scars from that.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:09):**  And when they are seeing that you are local, that you are persistent, you are there, you  are executed about what you are saying to provide confidence in one of our growers just  tell us like a few weeks ago, he was part of us.  He was like, hosting some kind of autonomous groups talking about the future of autonomous  or we said in front of everyone that he prefer companies with maybe a less innovative solution,  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:35):**  but with a bit with boost on the ground that will help them to walk when those things are  becoming out there, then company that have promises that they will take you to the moon  and will increase your yield by x, y, z.  But in the end, this is farming, there was always middle of the night timing will happen  and they need people to walk with on that.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:54):**  Again, I don't think it's justice, our competitive advantage.  I think that this is the only way to succeed in farming to be perfectly honest.  Are you seeing the skill sets that these farms need change as they have more technologies  like yours, more autonomy?  Do they need different skills?  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:10):**  Yeah, definitely.  I see also the people that are recruiting.  I believe that in the next few years, all the farm will be much different.  There will be less people in the farm, highly educated people that will run a farm with  technology, with multiple technologies.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:28):**  I already think that the young generation is, it's other people.  They are much more like tech savvy, they are much more reliant on technology.  My father is still running the farm, is still working with gut feeling now.  It's amazing when you have 70 years of experience.  Our generation don't have 70 years and will not have 70 years of experience.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:53):**  They work with technology.  Throughout our conversation, a few nuggets from Iftok really stuck out, especially for  those interested in how technology might help bridge today's ag labor shortfall.  For entrepreneurs, Iftok pointed out that though it's critical to listen to your customers  when building your product, it's just as important to understand the difference between  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:12):**  what they say they want and what their problems actually are.  Being able to find the best solution for your customers' actual pain points and being  able to explain why your solution might not look exactly like what they told you to build  is key.  For those especially interested in the autonomous equipment space, Iftok's prediction that  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:29):**  the companies that build the tools might not be as dominant in the long term as those that  enable the tools is insightful.  For a company making autonomous equipment or retrofit tools, it's not difficult to  imagine even a near-term future where they get their lunch eaten by the existing equipment  companies as they bring autonomous or retrofit tech in-house.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:50):**  Fielding strategy to avoid this fate is to own the platform that allows a mixed fleet  of equipment to interact seamlessly.  It's a difficult strategy for sure, so we'll be watching.  Finally, for the strategists out there, Iftok's points about delivering services alongside  software in the ag space were interesting.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:34:07):**  Farmer customers certainly appreciate boots-on-the-ground partners who can show up to help troubleshoot  24-7, 365.  But balancing that desire with a sustainable business model is a huge challenge, even for  companies based in the same country as their key markets.  Iftok says he doesn't see strong service delivery as a competitive advantage as much  
**[0:34:25-0:34:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:34:25):**  as the cost of doing business.  But with labor markets as tight as they are, I'm left wondering when the cost of an on-the-ground  service does become untenable.  So that's it for another episode of AgTech So What.  A huge thanks to our guests Iftokberger of FieldIn.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:34:40):**  And of course, thank you for listening.

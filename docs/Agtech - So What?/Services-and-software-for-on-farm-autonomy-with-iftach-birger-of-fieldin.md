### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 04 May 2022 20:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agbenthic Group.  
**[0:00:05-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:05):**  I'm Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:07):**  Autonomous equipment has come a long way in a relatively short period of time, and the  
**[0:00:11-0:00:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:11):**  benefits it promises, especially in high labor sectors like specialty crops, are pretty huge.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:17):**  But between the almost completely manual present and a nearly or fully autonomous future, there  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:22):**  is a very messy middle.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:24):**  And that could complicate the picture for companies looking to win in this space.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:29):**  We already living in the mixed fleet world.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:31):**  All our data is coming from a mixed fleet.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:33):**  The mixed fleet will be, some of them will be autonomous and some of them not.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:38):**  And some of them will be of this company and some of them will be autonomous of this company.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:43):**  So autonomy is a mean to an end.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:45):**  And I know it will be commodity.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:47):**  The winner will not be autonomous solution.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:51):**  That's Iftak Berger, co-founder and COO at FieldIn, a farm data and autonomous equipment  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:56):**  startup based in Israel.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:00:58):**  Iftak's experience with FieldIn offers some valuable insight, not only on how the autonomous  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:02):**  sector might shape up, but also on SaaS models in agriculture.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:06):**  He also shares some excellent stories on building a company outside your biggest market and  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:11):**  how to meet your first international customers.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:13):**  But first, we'll learn a bit more about FieldIn and about Iftak's journey.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:17):**  He was born and raised on one of the largest specialty crop farms in Israel, where he did  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:21):**  everything from the most basic tasks to managing the whole operation and even launching an  
**[0:01:25-0:01:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:25):**  olive oil business alongside the farm.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:28):**  From there, he got a master's in plant science and while doing his coursework, met his now  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:32):**  co-founder who had deeper experience in tech and entrepreneurship, though much less direct  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:36):**  experience in ag.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:38):**  In a case of what Iftak describes as perfect timing, they decided to just start and they  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:43):**  had a vision for a transformative company from the get go.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:46):**  So our basically mission didn't change since we started the company.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:51):**  From day one, our mission was to provide high value crops growers with data to better manage  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:01:57):**  their day to day operation, to become more efficient and accurate in every activity they  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:02:03):**  are doing in the farm.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:02:07):**  So it's the same mission, like we are focusing on this specific goal of the high value crops  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:02:12):**  grower.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:02:13):**  Just to be clear, when I'm talking about high value crop grower, I'm talking about crops  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:02:17):**  that are more than $2,000 per acre on the production costs.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:02:23):**  So it's more about the trees, it's about the high value crops, it's the food that we are  
**[0:02:27-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:02:27):**  eating, what we are buying in the supermarket is the vegetables and it's the tree fruits,  
**[0:02:34-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:02:34):**  apples, almonds, nuts.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:02:35):**  This part of the farming is a part that always suffer from less technologies because the  
**[0:02:42-0:02:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:02:42):**  big companies focus like the John Deere of the world, Case New Orleans, the pesticide  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:02:50):**  companies, they're focused on the broad acre, on the big acreage crop like the corn and  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:02:56):**  the soy, et cetera.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:02:58):**  And the high value crop that is more specific always add less technology, although they  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:04):**  are very sophisticated growers because they are growing stuff that is very hard to grow.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:08):**  The cost of mistake can be very high in high value crops, but again, it's about focus.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:14):**  So there is the big companies never focused on that.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:17):**  So we felt that this is the place that will embarrass our technology in the best way.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:23):**  They also have higher willingness to pay, right?  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:26):**  Because of the value of the crops, you can charge more for the services.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:30):**  I imagine that had a role as well.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:33):**  Exactly.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:34):**  And there is a loss.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:35):**  And another big thing about high value crops, they are not a commodity.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:41):**  So the meaning that the earnings, like the margins are basically based on their performance  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:47):**  because commodity, it's not always about you.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:50):**  You can never like, I don't know, something that happened in some other place in the world  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:53):**  and then the price of drop.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:03:56):**  With the high value crops, the good growers, their wins are bigger.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:06):**  Tell me a little bit more about the journey of getting to where you are today.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:09):**  Any failures, any pivots, any mistakes along the way that you're able to share?  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:14):**  Yeah, mistakes.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:15):**  Mistakes are happening every day in startup just to be fully transparent.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:20):**  But the journey, yeah, it started.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:22):**  So we started in Israel and Israel is it's a small growers compared to the world, to  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:27):**  the growers that now we are working in.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:28):**  The meaning is that the average size of a grower is probably will be around the hundred  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:34):**  acres.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:36):**  And these growers have a different mentality than the big growers.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:39):**  Currently, our minimum, we work with commercial growers because our product is focusing on  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:46):**  helping big operations.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:48):**  But when we started, we didn't, we focused on the smallest.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:50):**  We still have a lot of clients in Israel.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:53):**  So there are still clients of field and there are still small growers.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:04:56):**  But if I think about, it's not a mistake, but something that we can do faster is to  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:00):**  come faster to the US or to your main market because we were staying in Israel for years  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:06):**  before we put our first, we call from the first client in the US.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:13):**  And when you are finding the first client, then the acceleration of your company is really  
**[0:05:18-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:18):**  starting because until then you are building a product.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:20):**  By the way, it's not that the product was 180 degree different, but it's not the same  
**[0:05:26-0:05:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:26):**  product.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:27):**  So if I can give like a tip for a young entrepreneur, they need to accelerate their time to get  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:32):**  to the real market that they are looking for, because this is the only way to check your  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:36):**  product market fit and really investing in the right thing.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:40):**  But if I come back to the journey, we've done that for years in Israel, we developed the  
**[0:05:44-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:44):**  product.

**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:50):**  Like I think after two years, like we was like, we work with all the relevant growers  
**[0:05:55-0:05:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:55):**  in Israel, all of the relevant acres.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:05:57):**  And then in 2017, we started our journey in the US with one of the biggest animal growers  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:05):**  in the world.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:07):**  When you decided to come to California, did you just show up?

**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:12):**  Did you get pulled in by customers?  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:14):**  Like how did you actually get to California and getting that first client?  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:17):**  Was it a relationship you had or tell us the story of that first client?  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:22):**  So we probably had a very good product market fit because we've been in a conference in  
**[0:06:26-0:06:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:26):**  San Francisco.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:27):**  And basically this goal came to us directly and tell us that you need our solution because  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:34):**  he heard about us.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:36):**  And we just started and just to be clear, this is the biggest goal in the world, the  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:41):**  goal that came to us.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:42):**  So it was to be honest, more lucky than we were.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:46):**  Right place, right time.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:47):**  Yeah, we was planning to walk in the States, but again, I think that they come to us, they  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:54):**  heard about us and they said that they heard about our solution and they needed it.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:06:58):**  It was like a spring solution, like to help them to better manage their spring operations.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:07:03):**  It is a very expensive and complex thing to manage when you are a big grower.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:07:11):**  So this was our first step.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:07:12):**  It helped us a lot to work with this grower because we tested with him.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:07:16):**  And then we started to get more and more clients over in California, in the Central Valley.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:07:22):**  And once we are working with them, also our valuable position was go with them because  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:07:27):**  one of the biggest things that you can do as a, as in, when the company is listening  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:07:32):**  to your clients, because, and, and, and I would say something I done basically every  
**[0:07:38-0:07:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:07:38):**  like everything in elements when I was young, like I, I know how to do it yet your clients  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:07:46):**  know always better than you, what they need.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:07:49):**  Now you need to listen exactly, it's not that everything that they are saying is exactly  
**[0:07:53-0:07:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:07:53):**  how you need to make your product.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:07:55):**  But if you listen carefully and you understand the pain points, this is the main thing, then  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:08:01):**  you can evolve the product.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:08:03):**  So when we started, we provided like a spring solution, like a platform to help you better  
**[0:08:08-0:08:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:08:08):**  manage your spring operation, like closing the pest management cycle from scouting, from  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:08:15):**  looking for the pest or for the disease, make the recommendation and then actual spring,  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:08:20):**  measure it and close the loop.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:08:23):**  And we evolve with that into a smart farm.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:08:26):**  So basically in the last three years, we provide a full smart farm solution that basically  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:08:33):**  cover all the operation in the farm.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:08:35):**  So we are measuring every mechanical activity that's happening in the farm from checking  
**[0:08:40-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:08:40):**  irrigation liquid with your ATVs up to measure how many seconds you're shaking every tree  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:08:49):**  and of course spraying and mowing and every other activity.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:08:52):**  So basically we provide a one-stop-stop solution to manage all your operation in the farm.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:08:58):**  That also lead us to the autonomy solutions that this is like the next generation of what  
**[0:09:05-0:09:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:05):**  we are working on.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:07):**  Do you have an example of that challenge of listening to your customers?  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:12):**  Like when they say they want one thing, but when you actually watch how they operate or  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:17):**  see how it works in the field, you realize that what they're saying isn't exactly what  
**[0:09:20-0:09:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:20):**  they want.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:21):**  It needs to manifest in a slightly different way.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:23):**  I think about something that I hear a lot from growers that I agree in eye level on  
**[0:09:29-0:09:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:29):**  that.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:30):**  And growers, they always say that they want one stop shop, one solution, that everything  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:35):**  will be on it.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:37):**  Now they're right in the concept of that, but this is not what they need.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:42):**  It's not about the one stop.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:43):**  They just need seamlessly operating systems that basically will help them to utilize basically  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:51):**  every technology that they can implement in the farm in a way that will make one plus  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:09:58):**  one equal to three.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:00):**  The meaning is that two systems need to, if they can, bring the data to the one place  
**[0:10:06-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:06):**  that they can take the decision.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:08):**  Do you think that it's not what they want or not what they need, or is it just hard  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:12):**  to build?  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:13):**  In the current ecosystem, it's hard to build.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:15):**  I think that in the long run, this is what will happen.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:18):**  By the way, this is what we are aiming to do.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:21):**  And again, it's not about the one stop shop.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:23):**  It's about the ability to utilize technology like your phone, right?  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:29):**  You don't care what's happening on every app, what's on the backend, et cetera.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:33):**  But once you have app, you have operating systems that running everything on that, it's  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:37):**  make your life easier, right?  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:39):**  It's easy access.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:40):**  So in the end, it's very complex to be a grower, right?  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:44):**  Because let's face it, it's not depend, a lot of stuff not depend on you.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:48):**  And it's pretty crazy to a business.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:50):**  There is a climate change and there is a weather events that they cannot control.  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:57):**  There is no label.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:10:58):**  They have a label shortage.

**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:11:11):**  In this world, I believe that they need access to the best in-class technologies and the

**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:11:40):**  different crops and the needs and then seasonally.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:11:43):**  So the challenge that you guys face, I would imagine is how do we balance the desire for  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:11:49):**  this streamlined all in one experience with the fact that there are many different sub

**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:12:27):**  way stop stops.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:12:28):**  What is the meaning there is a agronomic platform and there is operational platform, agronomic  
**[0:12:34-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:12:34):**  platform.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:12:36):**  It's companies in our market like Simios, if you're there about them or fight eggs that  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:12:41):**  they are like, try to bring a lot of agronomic data into one place and have them to take  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:12:46):**  decision.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:12:47):**  And there is the operational.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:12:48):**  The agronomy is the why we are irrigating, why we all need to spray because there is  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:12:54):**  a lot of data that they need to summarize and get to the growth, take the decision or  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:12:59):**  taking the decision for him.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:00):**  And the how is what we are doing.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:02):**  This is the operational side.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:04):**  For example, the why can say you have a pest, right?  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:08):**  Or you need to harvest now.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:11):**  The how is okay.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:12):**  Now that I have this data, how I'm doing the most efficient and accurate way.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:17):**  So from the first, from the get go, we are looking at only two separate platforms that  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:23):**  also the personas in the farm are not the same person.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:26):**  The persona for the agronomy chief agronomist is this person.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:31):**  And the operation is the VP operation.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:34):**  Actually it's also the CEO most of the time, the companies, because the majority of fact  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:38):**  farming is doing is operational, right?  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:39):**  There is a decision and then a lot of machines and people that need to do something based  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:46):**  on the decisions it was taking on the agronomy.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:48):**  So on this side of the operation, yes, this is where we are seeing ourself as a one-stop  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:53):**  shop.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:54):**  So we are working for example with other companies also, and we connect sense of other companies  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:13:59):**  that connect to our solution.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:14:01):**  For example, a gate controllers for sprayers.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:14:06):**  We are not developing every algorithm in the world.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:14:08):**  We just want to provide to the growth the ability to utilize the best in class technology  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:14:13):**  to be more accurate and efficient in the day to day operation.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:14:18):**  We also connecting, for example, if we look to the autonomous part, we are not seeing  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:14:22):**  ourself as the only autonomous solution provider in the world.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:14:26):**  The opposite, we are seeing ourself as a company that will provide the recommendation and what  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:14:33):**  to do to the autonomous machines that we drive in the farm based on our operating system,  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:14:38):**  because we have the data that capture of, okay, this is what needs to be done.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:14:43):**  We need to spray this block with this gallon per acre and this field, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:14:47):**  Now it's only a task that we'll send to an autonomous vehicle or it could be also our  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:14:52):**  autonomous vehicle because we are also building retrofit kits that's sitting on tractors,  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:14:58):**  but it's part of the operational ecosystem, if it makes sense.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:03):**  It makes sense to me that you guys would start in tracking and recording on the operational  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:06):**  side, because then you can understand where there's low hanging fruit for autonomy, like  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:12):**  where you can actually automate.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:13):**  Is that how you thought about it?  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:14):**  Like let's monitor and capture the data and then let's see where we can actually introduce  
**[0:15:18-0:15:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:18):**  autonomy to take out labor or save cost.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:21):**  Was that the plan?  
**[0:15:22-0:15:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:23):**  Again, when we started the 2013 autonomy was something that you see in science fiction,  
**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:30):**  but when we started, our first thing was to provide the transparency, visibility and metrics,  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:37):**  because I will say, and I don't think if farming, you will see that there is a lot of data on  
**[0:15:43-0:15:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:43):**  farming.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:44):**  You will go to UC Davis or you will go to other universities around the world.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:49):**  The data is agronomic data, how to grow your crop.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:53):**  There is not a lot of data of how to operate your farm.  
**[0:15:58-0:15:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:58):**  And it's crazy, right?  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:15:59):**  You look at the multimillion dollar companies or multi-billion dollar companies, and basically  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:04):**  they don't have a clue what is a good shaking time, for example, for shakings.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:09):**  Now I'm talking about the millions of dollars or tens million dollars they're spending only  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:14):**  on this activity.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:15):**  And they don't know if they need to shake it for a second and then go to the next three  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:20):**  and eight seconds.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:21):**  They just don't know.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:22):**  They're doing that like 30, 40, 50 years the same way.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:27):**  And they don't know what is the industry benchmark for that.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:29):**  What is the best practice?  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:31):**  So our goal was from the data is first of all to create metrics, to create data, to  
**[0:16:36-0:16:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:36):**  create a language that everybody in the farm and the ecosystem will talk on the same metrics.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:44):**  And this is what we've done.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:46):**  I think this is our biggest thing that Fielding has done to the industry.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:50):**  And this is why we became so successful because we basically took something very complex and  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:16:55):**  we made it very easy because we make it to talk on very specific metrics that every grower  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:01):**  understand, but now they can check themselves and improve themselves and understand how  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:06):**  they are comparing to the industry, to what they need to do.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:09):**  So that was our first initial thing.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:12):**  This was help us to help the growers to increase their coverage in a shift in a more than 25%  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:19):**  each shift.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:20):**  Maybe they reduce their operational costs by 25%, but it wasn't enough because the label  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:27):**  shortage worldwide and the cost of manpower of employees is something that is on the rise  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:32):**  in California only in the last five years, the cost was up by 75%.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:38):**  And also the label that there is, it's like, it's not on the same professional level like  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:45):**  it used to be.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:46):**  So for example, you are putting somebody very new on the sprayer, on the shaker, it will  
**[0:17:51-0:17:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:51):**  break the machine.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:52):**  It will not, it cannot do it.  
**[0:17:53-0:18:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:17:53):**  So we understood that label is one of like is the biggest challenges that farmers have  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:01):**  worldwide and for the growth.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:04):**  And when we look in there, we said, okay, autonomy is a key to solve this problem.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:10):**  And we as an operate, as a company that already work with the biggest growers on the world

**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:18):**  We have a big leverage of implementing these technologies in the field.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:23):**  So this is why we acquired Midnight Robotics.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:26):**  How did you think about that acquisition?  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:28):**  Did you search the landscape and then you picked them?  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:31):**  Why?  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:33):**  Tell us about why and how that acquisition went.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:35):**  So first of all, we look on, we look on the retrofit kit markets.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:42):**  The reason is because feeding is already have tens of thousands of sensor worldwide.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:50):**  We want to see how we can take the already existing ecosystem that we have and convert  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:57):**  them into autonomy.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:18:59):**  So the retrofit was fit for us.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:19:00):**  There is autonomous companies that are built from scratch, gas sprayers or monarchs.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:19:06):**  So this is not our, what we are looking of course, in the future, we will be part of  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:19:11):**  the ecosystem.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:19:12):**  So that is one thing.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:19:13):**  We look on the retrofit and on the retrofit specifically, when we look on what's happened,  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:19:17):**  we saw that the Midnight guys are the most progress company in terms of algorithms and  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:19:23):**  understanding of autonomy.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:19:26):**  It's a group of people that come from a spinoff of innovation.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:19:30):**  This is a leading LIDAR company that IPO'd two years ago in the NASDAQ.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:19:40):**  We saw the technology, tested the technology, and then when we see there is something that  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:19:46):**  is progress enough, then we done the acquisition.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:19:51):**  The retrofit space makes me think about an analog in another industry.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:19:54):**  If you think of GPS units for cars, we used to go rent a car and then we would need to  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:01):**  buy a separate GPS unit because the car didn't have a GPS in it.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:04):**  And so it was really helpful to have Garmin or whoever it was.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:07):**  Now the cars just come with the GPS embedded and so we don't need to buy that extra piece.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:12):**  When do you think you'll run up against the incumbents installing their own autonomy and  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:17):**  therefore maybe creates a problem for the Garmin's of this world?  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:22):**  So the way that we are looking on that, the real revolution will come when everything  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:26):**  will be autonomous on the farm.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:28):**  And I will explain why.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:30):**  You have employees that works on a tractor in the season, but then on the end of the  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:34):**  season on the harvesting, they will work on the shaker, the same person, because he work  
**[0:20:40-0:20:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:40):**  on one type of machine and then he moves to the other part of it because this is the cycle  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:43):**  of labor and farming.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:47):**  We are going to live, I think in the next 15 years, one five of a mixed fleet world.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:55):**  And again, it's different than the car.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:57):**  The one car is the world.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:20:58):**  In farming, the one tractor is nasty.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:01):**  The swarm, the fleet is what is important because everything connected.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:05):**  So we are going to live in a world of mixed fleet.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:08):**  The mixed fleet will be, some of them will be autonomous and some of them not.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:12):**  And some of them will be of this company and some of them will be autonomous of this company.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:18):**  Like now we are going to farm, you will see tractors of John Deere, of Case, of New Orleans  
**[0:21:23-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:23):**  and you will see sprayers of Aerofan, of Gas and other companies and more else and harvesting  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:30):**  machine.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:31):**  So it's going to be a transition model.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:35):**  And we, again, as a company, we are seeing ourselves as the operating system of this  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:40):**  revolution, not as the autonomy.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:43):**  The autonomy, yes, it's going to be.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:45):**  And this mixed world, we as a company, we already solved the biggest problem of digitize  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:51):**  everything.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:52):**  We are already digitized.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:53):**  We already living in the mixed fleet world.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:56):**  All our data is coming from a mixed fleet.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:21:57):**  So you are right, autonomy is a means to an end.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:02):**  And I know it will be commodity.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:03):**  The big company, the winner will not be autonomous solution.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:09):**  Because like you said, the Garmin is a tool.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:11):**  It's a tool for something much bigger, go faster from one point to the next point.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:18):**  Yeah, the operational complexity makes sense to me.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:21):**  And to your point about the humans, like you haven't solved the whole problem if you've  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:25):**  only automated one task because the farmer still has to pay for that employee to do the  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:29):**  other task.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:30):**  So I guess that leads to another possible business model, which is to be a contract  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:34):**  operator and to actually work to provide the entire service.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:38):**  Did you ever consider that or other different business models?  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:40):**  Yeah, we can only consider it, but we are coming to serve the world, not the one company.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:47):**  So in our business model is SAS.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:49):**  So run a SAS model company in the agriculture world that is very unique thing.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:22:55):**  There is not a lot of companies that are eating the SAS metric of a gross company.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:23:01):**  To start be the person that the others of employees are driving on a spray to spray,  
**[0:23:07-0:23:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:23:07):**  this is sounds great on paper, but it's very hard to grow to be like a worldwide companies  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:23:14):**  being the operating system of the world.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:23:16):**  Interesting you say that, cause I actually perceive the operating system play as also  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:23:24):**  challenging or also challenging to scale for what we were saying before about like what  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:23:29):**  works in specialty crops in California is very different than what works in specialty  
**[0:23:34-0:23:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:23:34):**  crops in other markets, but also in broad acre.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:23:36):**  And so how do you actually get to the size of market and the lower cost of customer acquisition  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:23:43):**  that can make a software model work in agriculture?  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:23:47):**  Yeah, so this is the thing, what we already built is basically something that we work  
**[0:23:53-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:23:53):**  with the majority of the crops of high value crops because the basic of tractor and what  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:24:00):**  tractor is doing is not so different between apples growers in Washington state to a urban  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:24:06):**  grower in California and to a vineyard grower in Australia.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:24:10):**  Now it's different on the business side.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:24:13):**  There is countries that the growers are more commercial like Australia and the US and there  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:24:19):**  is countries that the high value crops are less commercial in the way they work like  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:24:23):**  in Europe, they are a lot smaller growers.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:24:26):**  So this is the main difference, but like in terms of how you are running the operation,  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:24:33):**  the basic of the same, there is agronomics, they take a decision and then there is tractors

**[0:30:27-0:30:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:30:27):**  There's more competitors for you.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:30:29):**  The growers are comparing you to other solutions and they have to decide if they pick you or  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:30:34):**  if they pick someone else is service why they pick you or are there other reasons?  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:30:39):**  Yeah, I think it's not only that we have a good brand.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:30:43):**  We don't have a lot of competition to be perfectly honest.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:30:46):**  There is, but they are not the direct, they don't have our value proposition.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:30:50):**  And yes, I think that our goal is speaking in their language.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:30:54):**  It's always going to be, by the way, a local people, person that from this area, and by  
**[0:30:59-0:31:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:30:59):**  the way, there is another thing that's happening in farming.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:02):**  There is so many white elephants, like companies that came and go and growers still have a  
**[0:31:08-0:31:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:08):**  scars from that.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:09):**  And when they are seeing that you are local, that you are persistent, you are there, you  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:13):**  are executed about what you are saying to provide confidence in one of our growers just  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:18):**  tell us like a few weeks ago, he was part of us.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:20):**  He was like, hosting some kind of autonomous groups talking about the future of autonomous  
**[0:31:26-0:31:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:26):**  or we said in front of everyone that he prefer companies with maybe a less innovative solution,  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:35):**  but with a bit with boost on the ground that will help them to walk when those things are  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:39):**  becoming out there, then company that have promises that they will take you to the moon  
**[0:31:44-0:31:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:44):**  and will increase your yield by x, y, z.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:46):**  But in the end, this is farming, there was always middle of the night timing will happen  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:51):**  and they need people to walk with on that.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:54):**  Again, I don't think it's justice, our competitive advantage.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:31:57):**  I think that this is the only way to succeed in farming to be perfectly honest.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:01):**  Are you seeing the skill sets that these farms need change as they have more technologies  
**[0:32:06-0:32:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:06):**  like yours, more autonomy?  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:07):**  Do they need different skills?  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:10):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:11):**  I see also the people that are recruiting.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:13):**  I believe that in the next few years, all the farm will be much different.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:18):**  There will be less people in the farm, highly educated people that will run a farm with  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:23):**  technology, with multiple technologies.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:28):**  I already think that the young generation is, it's other people.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:32):**  They are much more like tech savvy, they are much more reliant on technology.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:38):**  My father is still running the farm, is still working with gut feeling now.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:44):**  It's amazing when you have 70 years of experience.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:47):**  Our generation don't have 70 years and will not have 70 years of experience.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:53):**  They work with technology.

**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:32:59):**  those interested in how technology might help bridge today's ag labor shortfall.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:04):**  For entrepreneurs, Iftok pointed out that though it's critical to listen to your customers  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:08):**  when building your product, it's just as important to understand the difference between  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:12):**  what they say they want and what their problems actually are.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:15):**  Being able to find the best solution for your customers' actual pain points and being  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:19):**  able to explain why your solution might not look exactly like what they told you to build  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:24):**  is key.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:25):**  For those especially interested in the autonomous equipment space, Iftok's prediction that  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:29):**  the companies that build the tools might not be as dominant in the long term as those that  
**[0:33:34-0:33:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:34):**  enable the tools is insightful.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:36):**  For a company making autonomous equipment or retrofit tools, it's not difficult to  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:41):**  imagine even a near-term future where they get their lunch eaten by the existing equipment  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:46):**  companies as they bring autonomous or retrofit tech in-house.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:50):**  Fielding strategy to avoid this fate is to own the platform that allows a mixed fleet  
**[0:33:53-0:33:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:53):**  of equipment to interact seamlessly.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:56):**  It's a difficult strategy for sure, so we'll be watching.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:33:59):**  Finally, for the strategists out there, Iftok's points about delivering services alongside  
**[0:34:04-0:34:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:34:04):**  software in the ag space were interesting.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:34:07):**  Farmer customers certainly appreciate boots-on-the-ground partners who can show up to help troubleshoot  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:34:11):**  24-7, 365.

**[0:34:18-0:34:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:34:18):**  companies based in the same country as their key markets.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:34:21):**  Iftok says he doesn't see strong service delivery as a competitive advantage as much  
**[0:34:25-0:34:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:34:25):**  as the cost of doing business.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:34:27):**  But with labor markets as tight as they are, I'm left wondering when the cost of an on-the-ground  
**[0:34:31-0:34:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/5/5/farm-autonomy-fieldin-iftach#t=0:34:31):**  service does become untenable.

**[0:00:19-0:00:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:19):**  Now onto today's show.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:22):**  If you are, well, alive in agriculture right now, you've probably heard a little something  
**[0:00:27-0:00:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:27):**  about the challenges in today's fertilizer industry.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:30):**  Last year, 2021, we were buying liquid nitrogen for $195 a ton.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:38):**  This year it cost us $650 a ton.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:41):**  So you usually need about a pound of nitrogen to grow a bushel of corn.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:45):**  If our nitrogen cost went from 60 to 80 bucks an acre, now to over 200 bucks an acre, that's  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:50):**  pretty significant.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:52):**  That's Clay Govere.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:53):**  He's a Nebraska farmer who joined us for our latest bonus episode to talk about financing  
**[0:00:58-0:00:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:58):**  expansion.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:00:59):**  But he also offered an eye-opening look into the current situation on the ground when it  
**[0:01:02-0:01:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:02):**  comes to nutrients.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:04):**  There are a lot of factors at play here, not least of which the war in Ukraine, which has  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:09):**  largely cut off Russia and Belarus, huge fertilizer producers from world markets.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:14):**  Our recent conversation with Clay and similar ones with other farmers and experts really  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:19):**  made it clear to us how opaque and in many ways antiquated the modern crop nutrient space  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:25):**  is, and how much innovation is sorely needed in fertilizer.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:29):**  This was our inspiration and motivation to bring you a series of episodes on the future  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:34):**  of fertilizer, starting today, where we're tackling probably the most talked about element,  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:38):**  nitrogen, the N in NPK.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:41):**  Now the modern factors affecting nitrogen fertilizer are many, and there are a lot of  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:46):**  people with a lot of different ideas aiming to relieve the pressure that farmers like  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:50):**  Clay are feeling.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:51):**  To be successful, however, these companies will have to figure out both the science and  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:01:56):**  the business of N. These are two big topics, so we've decided to tackle them in two parts.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:01):**  Today we'll talk the science of N, and over the next episode we'll break down the business.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:06):**  Over these two episodes, we're going to hear from a couple of different voices.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:10):**  First I want to introduce you to Charlie Day, the CEO of Jupiter Ionics.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:14):**  Now a relevant disclosure here, Jupiter Ionics is a portfolio company of ours, which, well,  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:19):**  means he better be good, right?  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:21):**  Anyway, Jupiter is pioneering a novel pathway to the creation of ammonia, the essential  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:26):**  basis of nitrogen fertilizer, using a combination of electrochemistry and renewable energy.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:31):**  If you're not up to your eyeballs in the fertilizer industry every day, that sentence  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:35):**  was probably pretty jargony.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:37):**  So I asked Charlie if he'd share his snappiest introduction to the science that his company's  
**[0:02:41-0:02:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:41):**  working on.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:43):**  To answer the question of how the science works, I might start with a history of how  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:46):**  the existing process to make ammonia works, which is the Haber-Bosch process.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:50):**  It's a very famous process.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:52):**  It's one of the first large-scale industrial processes developed at the turn of the last  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:56):**  century in the early 1900s.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:02:58):**  And essentially what that does is it takes nitrogen from the air, the air around it is  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:02):**  80% nitrogen, takes nitrogen from the air and at very high temperature and very high  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:07):**  pressure, it cracks open that nitrogen molecule using a catalyst, combines it with hydrogen  
**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:12):**  to make ammonia, which is NH3.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:15):**  So essentially the industrial process to make ammonia, to make fertilizer for the last century  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:20):**  has been this very large, high pressure, high temperature process driven largely by fossil  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:24):**  fuels.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:25):**  And so our technology comes into a world where it's no longer the case that fossil fuels  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:30):**  are our sort of dominant or preferred form of energy.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:33):**  We're moving to a world where renewable electricity is the preferred form of energy.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:38):**  And so our researchers have figured out a way to crack open that nitrogen molecule,  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:43):**  not using high temperature, high pressure, but using electricity.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:46):**  And so what we do is we use renewably generated electricity.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:49):**  It can come from solar or from wind or whatever, but we use that electricity to crack open  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:53):**  that nitrogen molecule and combine it with protons to make NH3.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:03:57):**  So we've moved from what is to use a big word, a thermochemical process to something that's  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:02):**  an electrochemical process.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:04):**  So it's driven by electricity.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:05):**  And we're excited by that because it takes the fossil fuels out of the equation and enables  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:09):**  you to have a synthetic ammonia process that is just powered by renewable electricity.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:14):**  So from an end user perspective, I guess, who do you think about as the users and for  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:19):**  them will what Jupiter produces be different than what they can get out of the existing  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:23):**  Haber-Bosch system?  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:25):**  At the end of the day, we're still making ammonia.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:27):**  It's a molecule, it's a gas or a liquid depending on the pressure, and we're still making the  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:31):**  same substance.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:32):**  So in that sense, there's no change to what we're making.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:34):**  But the interesting thing is that our technology opens up the potential to do it at a much  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:40):**  smaller scale than has traditionally been possible.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:42):**  So the traditional Haber-Bosch process to make ammonia tends to be done in very large,  
**[0:04:48-0:04:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:48):**  centralized industrial plants that make a million tons a year.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:51):**  But because our process is an electrochemical one, it's inherently more modular and more  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:56):**  flexible.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:04:57):**  So we open up the opportunity to make it in a more decentralized way.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:00):**  It's a little bit like moving from a world where all of our electricity is generated  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:05):**  in large centralized coal fired power stations to a world in which we can make our electricity  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:10):**  using solar cells on our roof and our paddocks.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:13):**  And so for end users, it opens up the opportunity of making your ammonia, your fertilizer much  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:18):**  closer to the point of use.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:19):**  Now, given the pretty significant pressure on emissions, intensity of production and  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:24):**  kind of environmental credentials of the sector, as well as just like supply chain volatility  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:28):**  and the kind of brittleness of that centralized model, a lot of people are trying to green  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:34):**  or redesign the Haber-Bosch process.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:37):**  Tell me about kind of other approaches and how Jupiter fits into those different models.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:43):**  So there's a few different approaches to decarbonizing green ammonia that we see in the industry.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:48):**  The most advanced one and the one where most of the energy is going into at the moment  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:52):**  takes the traditional Haber-Bosch process, but tries to make it work at a smaller scale  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:05:58):**  and in milder conditions that are more amenable to working at a small scale.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:02):**  And what you can do is you can take that process and then marry it to a water electrolyzer  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:07):**  as your source of hydrogen, because the challenge in the traditional process is you typically  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:11):**  get hydrogen from fossil fuels.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:13):**  And so if you marry up a water electrolyzer with a scaled down Haber-Bosch, you can make  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:18):**  a distributed ammonia production system.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:21):**  And there are several companies that are trying to do that.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:23):**  And I think that's a really exciting pathway, has some challenges because you're still using  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:28):**  a thermochemical process.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:30):**  So it doesn't like the sort of intermittent type of supply that you typically get from  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:34):**  renewable electricity.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:35):**  And that can be a challenge.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:36):**  The other way to go to fertilizer, not so much to ammonia, but to fertilizer is to use  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:43):**  electrical currents.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:44):**  So some say lightning actually forms nitrates directly.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:47):**  So you can go directly from nitrogen in the atmosphere to nitrates.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:52):**  And there's a great startup out of California called Nitricity that's using that approach.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:56):**  So there are a few different pathways to do this.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:06:59):**  And we certainly think that the speed at which we need to make this transition to sustainable  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:03):**  fertilizer is such that we're going to need every possible pathway.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:07):**  And tell me about the environmental benefits.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:09):**  Charlie, you mentioned running on renewable energy and being able to be used with intermittent  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:13):**  energy production.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:15):**  What's the overall environmental benefit or performance based on both the kind of existing  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:20):**  fertilizer options or ammonia options, but also based on potentially biological alternatives?  
**[0:07:25-0:07:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:25):**  If you look at the sort of carbon footprint of farming in an archetypal broadacre cropping  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:32):**  kind of scenario, there's a carbon footprint that goes with the fertilizer manufacture  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:36):**  stage and for ammonia that's two tons of carbon dioxide for every ton of ammonia that you  
**[0:07:41-0:07:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:41):**  make.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:42):**  But then there's additional emissions through the supply chain as we bring the fertilizer  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:46):**  from the production point to the farm.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:47):**  And then there's emissions associated with the application of fertilizer in the field.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:52):**  And in fact, those supply chain plus field emissions can exceed the quantum of emissions  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:57):**  in the production stage.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:07:58):**  And so the benefits that we can bring on a carbon emissions front are certainly in that  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:03):**  production stage and in the supply chain, potentially also in the on-farm application,  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:08):**  depending on how much flexibility we can give to the farmer.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:11):**  But beyond the carbon emissions, I think one of the exciting parts of our technology is  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:15):**  that it decouples the cost of the fertilizer from the key input cost today, which is the  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:21):**  natural gas price.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:22):**  And as we've seen in the market this year with the natural gas price going berserk,  
**[0:08:26-0:08:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:26):**  the fertilizer price has gone similarly.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:28):**  And so our technology opens up the opportunity to essentially give you a very stable fertilizer  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:33):**  price because it's largely in the capital cost.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:36):**  The inputs are water, air and renewable energy, which can be quite stable in price.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:40):**  And so that I think takes a risk factor out for our end users.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:44):**  So yeah, there are environmental benefits in terms of carbon reduction, but I think  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:48):**  also stability and price is a key benefit.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:51):**  And what are the limitations to the Jupiter solution?  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:53):**  I know it's early and we can talk a little bit about challenges to scaling up, but if  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:08:57):**  you imagine it at scale and working the way you intend it to, what are the limitations?  
**[0:09:02-0:09:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:02):**  The main limitation at the moment is that it's early stage.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:04):**  And so there will be some unknowable technical challenges that will hit as we go to scale.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:09):**  Certainly we're very excited by what we see at the moment in terms of the performance  
**[0:09:14-0:09:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:14):**  that we're able to achieve.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:15):**  But as we go to scale, there'll be some complexities or compromises that I'm sure will come up.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:20):**  So we certainly anticipate that they will be there.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:22):**  As a new technology, we are, if you like, competing against the Haber-Bosch technology,  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:27):**  which is a century old, it's a very mature technology.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:30):**  It's had a lot of engineering applied to it.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:32):**  And we would expect that our performance in the first instance on whether it's energy  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:37):**  consumption or productivity will start out behind that mature technology and we'll have  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:42):**  to catch up.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:43):**  We see with a lot of other electrochemical technologies that there are very significant  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:48):**  learning benefits.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:49):**  So as you build more and as you deploy more capacity, costs come down and performance  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:55):**  improves.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:09:56):**  So we would expect to see that happen with our technology as we go forward as well.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:00):**  We've always thought there are other benefits along the lines of like energy storage or  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:04):**  kind of other potential uses.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:05):**  Can you talk a little bit about that?  
**[0:10:07-0:10:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:08):**  So that's one of the things we're excited about is that if you like an ancillary benefit,  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:12):**  because at one level you can think about our system as a way of converting electrons into  
**[0:10:18-0:10:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:18):**  molecules.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:19):**  So we're converting electricity into a molecule, in this case, ammonia, which has the benefit  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:24):**  of being easy to store and be useful for a wide range of things.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:28):**  And we haven't really talked about some of the other uses of ammonia as a fuel potentially,  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:33):**  but obviously it has uses fertilizer as a core use, but also potentially as fuel.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:37):**  And so our technology opens up the opportunity to help balance a grid potentially where you  
**[0:10:43-0:10:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:43):**  have surplus renewable electricity.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:45):**  And we see this certainly here in Australia at the moment, there are times of day when  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:49):**  there's a significant surplus of renewable energy in the grid.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:53):**  And it'd be great to have ways to convert some of that surplus electrical energy into  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:10:58):**  a usable chemical form.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:00):**  And that's one of the things that our technology enables.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:02):**  And so we are excited about that potential and because our technology operates across  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:07):**  a range of scales from kilowatts, megawatts, hopefully ultimately up to gigawatts, we can  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:13):**  offer that solution, if you like, at a range of scales.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:17):**  I imagine the interest from industry is varied in that some of the existing producers of  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:24):**  fertilizer and owners of Haber-Bosch facilities are saying like, no way this will work and  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:28):**  maybe some resistance or pushback, but yet there's probably pull from various players  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:32):**  in the industry.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:33):**  How much do you think about the current industry's momentum and capital as a barrier or what  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:40):**  kind of responses are you getting?  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:43):**  There's clearly wide recognition around the industry of the need to decarbonize ammonia  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:48):**  production.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:49):**  And as I said, there are a range of other strategies being deployed that existing industry  
**[0:11:55-0:11:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:55):**  players are very comfortable taking those.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:11:58):**  We are a very new approach, very different approach.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:01):**  And so I think we are being carefully watched by the larger players in the space.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:05):**  Some share our optimism that it will work at scale.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:07):**  Others are more skeptical.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:09):**  And so we have to manage that as we get to scale, as we hit our sort of scale up milestones  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:14):**  and manage our interactions with some of those large players.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:17):**  But as I say, I think the need to decarbonize ammonia is such that our technology will not  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:22):**  be the only green ammonia technology that takes us through to 2050.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:26):**  We think we can play a significant role, but there will be several green ammonia pathways  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:30):**  that take us to 2050.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:32):**  Have you experienced any setbacks so far, Charlie, either on the scientific end in terms  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:37):**  of getting towards an MVP or as you move as industry conversations?  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:41):**  What can you share about any setbacks so far?  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:43):**  Yeah, look, the life of a startup is, as I often say, a real roller coaster.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:49):**  And you can go up and down the roller coaster in the space of a week sometimes.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:52):**  So you can have some days when you think you're going to solve the world's problems in an  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:12:57):**  instant and then you can have weeks where you hit challenges or you hit technical problems.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:02):**  And so we certainly had our fair share of technical problems like that in the lab where  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:06):**  we've tried to do things or we've tried to adapt discoveries that we made in one context  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:10):**  and take them to a new context.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:12):**  And it turns out it doesn't work like that or nature doesn't want to reveal its secrets  
**[0:13:16-0:13:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:16):**  quite that readily.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:17):**  And so that's a normal part of daily life, I guess, in our company.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:20):**  We've got a team of really smart scientists and engineers who thrive on hard problems  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:24):**  and don't like to take those kind of failures as knockout blows.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:29):**  And pleased to say that so far we've seen some really great progress with the technology.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:33):**  But we know that there will be setbacks all the way through.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:36):**  As I say, nature won't reveal their secrets to us easily.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:40):**  So we're very focused on just trying to make sure we can bring the best brains to bear  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:44):**  on solving those challenges as fast as we can.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:46):**  And what's next for Jupiter?  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:48):**  It's on the near term horizon.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:51):**  And yeah, you talked a little bit about what keeps you up.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:53):**  But what are the next couple of things that you'll be chipping away at?  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:13:56):**  Yeah, so we're obviously working at the moment on scaling up our prototype.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:01):**  So we started in the archetypal test tube in the lab and now we're working with a larger  
**[0:14:06-0:14:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:06):**  and larger prototype.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:07):**  So we're up to prototypes that are about the size of an iPad, if you like, to give people  
**[0:14:11-0:14:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:11):**  a sense of the scale of the cells that we're working with now.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:14):**  And we need to continue to scale that up in the lab.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:17):**  And then we want to take it out into the field.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:19):**  So we've got some partnerships with farmers and fertilizer manufacturers.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:23):**  We want to take our technology out of the field and prove that we actually can integrate  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:27):**  this into a fertigation system.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:29):**  So that's on our roadmap for next year.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:31):**  Then beyond that, obviously, then taking our prototypes and turning them into a product  
**[0:14:35-0:14:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:35):**  that we can actually put on the market.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:37):**  And I'll be able to finally answer all those farmers who are ringing me looking for a unit.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:41):**  I'll be able to say we'll have one on sale, but that's probably more a mid decade kind  
**[0:14:45-0:14:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:45):**  of thing.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:46):**  And that's the roadmap that lies ahead of us for at least the next few years.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:50):**  But as I said before, the green ammonia opportunity is so large that we've certainly got a 10  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:55):**  or 15 year roadmap that sees us scaling up as fast as we can to meet that emerging demand.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:14:59):**  Charlie, where does the name Jupiter ionics come from?  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:03):**  Yeah, at about the time that I was working to write the business plan for the company,  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:08):**  my son, who was in secondary school, was doing a project on the solar system.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:14):**  And by coincidence, I happened to read about Jupiter and I realized the clouds on Jupiter  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:18):**  are made primarily of ammonia.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:20):**  And so it felt that that connection to ammonia worked.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:25):**  And also given the scale of the opportunity that we see in electrochemical ammonia, something  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:29):**  big like Jupiter made sense to us.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:32):**  That was really the genesis of Jupiter ionics as a name.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:35):**  And it stuck and we love it.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:37):**  This was just the beginning of the conversation I had with Charlie about the business model  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:40):**  and strategies for tackling the crop nutrient space.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:44):**  But in learning about the science behind Jupiter ionics and the alternative pathways that Charlie  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:48):**  outlined here, we thought it would be worth bringing in another voice, someone who's  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:52):**  following one of these alternate pathways, to learn more about the other options on the  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:56):**  table.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:15:57):**  So we called up Bill Brady, CEO and director at Kula Bio, a startup that is shaping a fertility  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:02):**  product that's in some ways similar and in others unrecognizably different from Jupiter  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:07):**  ionics.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:08):**  Kula is a biologically based nitrogen fertilizer powered not by renewable energy, but by living  
**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:13):**  material.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:14):**  Here's Bill.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:15):**  We produce microbes that grab nitrogen from the air and deposit it in the soil.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:23):**  So the air we breathe, as most everyone knows, is 80% nitrogen.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:28):**  The problem is you can't get at it because there are these fierce nitrogen-nitrogen triple  
**[0:16:34-0:16:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:34):**  bonds.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:35):**  And the only way you can break them down is through extremely high power or biologically.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:42):**  And these microbes do it.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:44):**  So that was the starting point of the technology.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:48):**  The difficulty is that these microbes, when they get into the soil, have to compete with  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:55):**  other microbes for food and energy.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:16:58):**  So actually their lifespan is very, very short, measured in hours.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:04):**  And so while they do fix some nitrogen on their own, they don't live long enough to  
**[0:17:10-0:17:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:10):**  fix a lot.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:12):**  So to give these microbes their own independent source of energy before they go into the soil  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:19):**  – and this is what we do in our proprietary bioreactors – so that when they're in  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:25):**  the soil, rather than living for hours, our microbes live for two and a half weeks.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:31):**  All of a sudden, two and a half weeks, that's a lot of time to do the nitrogen fixation.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:37):**  So the quantity of nitrogen becomes very relevant.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:40):**  And so when you say microbes, people have maybe heard about microbes in soil or microbes  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:44):**  generally, maybe microbes in the precision fermentation space around yeast or fungi.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:49):**  Tell me more about your microbes and maybe the process.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:52):**  Walk us through how it works.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:54):**  So our microbes are bacteria.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:17:57):**  And the bacteria is naturally occurring.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:00):**  We do not genetically modify the bacteria.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:03):**  We simply fatten them up before they go in the soil, like a bear prior to hibernation.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:09):**  It fattens itself up and then lives off of that fat over the winter.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:14):**  And this is a little bit like what we do to these microbes.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:18):**  So what happens is, the way we make them, is think of a big vat, and into that vat goes  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:25):**  water and microbes.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:29):**  And in the first part of our process, we feed those microbes a nutrition mix, and they multiply  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:36):**  like crazy.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:37):**  So we try to get as high a density of microbes as we possibly can.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:43):**  Just to give you a sense, if you think of a teaspoon of our product, which is a liquid  
**[0:18:47-0:18:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:47):**  by the way, a teaspoon of our product probably contains 50 billion microbes.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:18:56):**  So the first phase is really get them to multiply, multiply, multiply.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:01):**  And then at a certain point, we cut the nutrition.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:04):**  The microbes now, just like a human would, goes into a panic mode.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:08):**  Oh my goodness, there's no more food.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:11):**  We better start to store food, energy, fat.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:16):**  So now at this point, we feed the microbe carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and they produce  
**[0:19:22-0:19:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:22):**  basically a carbohydrate that is the energy storage that we fatten them up with before  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:29):**  they go into the soil.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:30):**  So once we get them fattened up to the right level, then we're finished.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:35):**  They come out of our reactor and they're ready for the soil.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:39):**  Now you mentioned that they are non-GMO.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:41):**  Is that an important characteristic for the engineering process and or for our customers?  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:46):**  I think both.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:47):**  So I think certainly if you have a genetically modified product, it's a whole nother level,  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:53):**  a whole nother bar to get on the farm for good reason.  
**[0:19:58-0:19:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:58):**  So that's one thing.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:19:59):**  But I think equally as important, and I give Dan Nocera so much credit for this, is that  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:05):**  he started with an extremely robust microbe and we didn't genetically modify it.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:11):**  We're not operating on the edge of science.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:14):**  It's not a very fickle microbe.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:17):**  And so it allows us to be really aggressive in the bioreactor, density and fattening them  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:23):**  up, and it's really robust in the soil.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:27):**  And so that's really allowed us to do what we wanted to do in the reactor.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:32):**  And it's also allowed us to get on the farm pretty quickly and start to get feedback on  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:38):**  the microbe, which is what we did.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:40):**  And how do you fit into the existing ag system?  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:43):**  You've got manufacturers, you've got retailers, you've got agronomists that are recommending  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:47):**  practice change, you've got farmers that are buying things, distribution.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:51):**  Where do you guys fit in knowing that it's still early, but how do you imagine fitting  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:54):**  into the system?  
**[0:20:56-0:21:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:20:56):**  One thing I would just tell you is when we started the company, we contacted 600 farmers  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:04):**  and had really meaningful discussions with 100 of them.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:07):**  And we went out and told them what we were doing.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:09):**  And the general reception was really positive.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:12):**  They were really interested for a solution like this, particularly because we improved  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:20):**  soil health over time, which is their primary asset.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:24):**  So there's a lot of positive vibes, but they said, but listen, let me tell you a few things.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:30):**  Number one, I'm not going to pay you any more money.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:34):**  Number two, I'm not going to change my farm practices.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:38):**  And number three, I'm not going to buy any new capital equipment.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:42):**  So you had better fit your product offering into that.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:46):**  And then we were walking away and they said, oh, and by the way, you have to show us that  
**[0:21:50-0:21:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:50):**  it works and not in some fancy lab in Harvard, but on my neighbor's farm.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:21:57):**  So talking about fitting into the system, that was lesson number one, which is, okay,  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:03):**  it's got to fit into those constraints.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:05):**  Otherwise it's not going to fly.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:07):**  So we went ahead and did that.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:10):**  And now we're working through how you get the farmer to say yes, which I get asked all  
**[0:22:17-0:22:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:17):**  the time, what keeps you up at night?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:19):**  That's it.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:20):**  You ultimately get the farmer to say yes.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:23):**  And like you said, there is a network of people that farmers trust.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:29):**  And sometimes it's their retail distributor.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:31):**  Sometimes it's a crop advisor.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:34):**  And these are people they've known for a lifetime.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:37):**  Their fathers probably knew each other and maybe their grandfathers knew each other.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:43):**  Maybe they go to church together on Sunday, but it's a very tight, very important network.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:48):**  And we're not only working with the farmers, but we're working with getting that entire  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:52):**  network to understand what we do and to do it in a way that's credible to them.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:22:58):**  And so that's a lot of hard work.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:00):**  Tell me about the practice change aspect.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:02):**  Kind of what are the differences in using biology versus chemistry in terms of like  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:06):**  how things get applied and how it fits into the agronomic system?  
**[0:23:11-0:23:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:11):**  So our product is a liquid.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:13):**  It looks like orange juice if you saw the product.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:17):**  And so we tried to design the product so that whatever the farmer's liquid distribution  
**[0:23:22-0:23:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:22):**  system is on the farm today, you could plug our product into that system and fertilize.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:31):**  And so that's what we do today.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:33):**  I will say if it's a drip irrigation system or an infero system, great for us.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:41):**  If it's a pivot sprayer, foliar application, we have less experience with that and it's  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:48):**  probably less desirable of an application method for us.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:53):**  But we'll get there with that too.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:23:55):**  And agronomically, do they need to change when in the season, thinking about water requirements,  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:01):**  thinking about other products, is there other elements of practice change in using Cooler's  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:04):**  product?  
**[0:24:06-0:24:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:06):**  Not really.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:07):**  The way we operate with the farmer is that we understand the grower's standard practice,  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:12):**  and then we figure out how they want to use the product.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:16):**  Some maybe want to do an application with synthetic and then the rest of the applications  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:20):**  with Cooler.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:21):**  Some might want to do them together.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:24):**  You might imagine they want to do both to mitigate the risk.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:27):**  And so we just work with the farmer on what works best for them.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:32):**  And then we figure out how much nitrogen we're going to replace.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:35):**  And based on our product density, etc., and how much each microbe can deliver, we recommend  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:41):**  a quantity of our product that will equal those pounds of nitrogen.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:47):**  And it just gets applied at the same timing intervals through the existing system.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:53):**  And how would you explain both the environmental benefits and limitations as well as the economic  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:24:59):**  benefits and limitations?  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:00):**  I know you mentioned cost parity, and I imagine you're working on that still.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:04):**  But how do you break down environmental and economic benefits and limitations?  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:09):**  So on the environmental side, there's really two parts to the story.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:14):**  One is the huge carbon avoidance.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:16):**  So if you don't use Haber-Bosch and you use Cooler, you save four pounds of CO2 for every  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:22):**  pound of nitrogen, at least.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:26):**  And then because of the way we feed the microbes carbon, remember I mentioned feeding them  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:33):**  carbon was part of the fattening them up.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:37):**  What happens is that when we fatten them up and the microbe goes into the soil, it draws  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:42):**  on that source of energy, does its job, and then eventually dies and stays as a source  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:48):**  of carbon in the soil.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:50):**  So we actually sequester carbon.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:54):**  Now how deep, how long it stays, those are all open questions.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:25:58):**  But the fact of the matter is we add carbon to the soil through our process.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:04):**  And so we're sequestering carbon, and you can look at that from a soil health point  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:09):**  of view and a carbon sequestration point of view.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:12):**  So that's the environmental side.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:14):**  On the cost side, we're really confident in this.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:18):**  Of course, we're in the process of scaling up.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:21):**  But if you in a reasonable, sensible engineering type of way, just go to a commercial scale  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:29):**  from where we are today, you get costs that are equal to or lower than synthetic nitrogen.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:35):**  And what does that look like in terms of performance, yield impacts, outcomes, does that end up  
**[0:26:40-0:26:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:40):**  comparable as well?  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:42):**  Most of what we've done is you can replace a significant part of your synthetic nitrogen  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:47):**  with Kula and get equivalent yields, no loss in yield.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:51):**  We have had a handful of produce crops where farmers have done that.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:26:59):**  But they have also done experiments using 100% of their synthetic nitrogen and put Kula  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:05):**  on top as a booster and gotten very interesting yield boosts.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:09):**  And we've seen this in particular in tomatoes and berries.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:13):**  So the product can be used in both ways.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:15):**  I think it depends on the crop and how the farmer wants to use it.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:20):**  My sense too of the strength of the value proposition or risk of the objection probably  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:25):**  goes something like just add it to what you already do and you get a yield bump is probably  
**[0:27:28-0:27:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:28):**  the easiest sell.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:29):**  And then substitute it for some of what you do and you get a cost reduction with no impact  
**[0:27:34-0:27:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:34):**  is probably the next easiest.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:35):**  And the third one is like some environmental benefit that probably still feels a little  
**[0:27:39-0:27:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:39):**  bit nebulous.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:40):**  Does that tend to be how they stack up?  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:43):**  I think you describe it quite well.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:45):**  There's one factor though that is very important in that hierarchy of what you said.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:49):**  There are parts of the world where nitrogen usage is starting to get regulated and reduced.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:27:56):**  And so in the US, for example, the state of California in certain counties is starting  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:03):**  to mandate significant nitrogen reductions on the order of 25 or 30% reductions.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:10):**  And so farmers just can't do that and lose the yield.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:14):**  That just doesn't work.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:22](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:15):**  And so in those cases, the value of simply having a sustainable nitrogen replacement  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:22):**  is probably higher than anything you said.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:27](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:24):**  So that's another key environmental driver as well.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:27):**  And you mentioned before that kind of maybe I got this wrong, like tailoring of how much  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:32):**  nitrogen you're replacing and that kind of customization.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:34):**  Is that like a per farm type of modeling that the agronomist would need to be involved in  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:40):**  or is that a more generic just how much you apply kind of calculation?  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:44):**  It's pretty clear to for us, for a leader of our product, how many pounds of synthetic  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:48):**  nitrogen equivalent that equals.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:51):**  So then how much you want to replace and how you use it.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:54):**  We have recommendations on that, but it depends on the farmers, the farmers comfort.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:28:59):**  The farmers can't and won't take a ton of risks.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:01):**  So whatever it takes to step into it in a very rational fashion with the farmers, we're  
**[0:29:07-0:29:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:07):**  ready to do that.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:08):**  But we're quite confident that we can replace meaningful amounts of nitrogen.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:12):**  And it's only going to get higher as we drive up the density of microbes and as we drive  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:18):**  up the fattening process to make those microbes even more viable in the soil.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:24):**  Have you experienced or what can you tell me about the setbacks that you've experienced  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:28):**  along the way, whether that's scientific or in terms of getting to an MVP or the rollout  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:32):**  or the investor tensions?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:34):**  In these type of scientific endeavors, you take a few steps forward and then you get  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:38):**  knocked down and you get a step back.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:41):**  And with biologics, the interesting thing, I had a long career in a public company that  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:45):**  was a chemical company.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:46):**  And you put what you needed to put in the reactor, you did the reaction right, you got  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:51):**  the same thing every time, you put it in a package, it didn't change and you were done.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:57](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:56):**  Everything's alive.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:29:57):**  It's alive when we make it, it's alive when we pack it, it's alive on the shelf and it's  
**[0:30:01-0:30:03](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:30:01):**  alive when it gets in the field.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:30:03):**  And there's a lot of challenges there.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:30:05):**  So you bump into really unexpected challenges all along the way.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:30:10):**  And we've had our share of them for sure.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:30:13):**  Bill why the name Kula?  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:30:15):**  One of the young scientists that came out of Dan Nocera's lab when we started the company  
**[0:30:19-0:30:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:30:19):**  was Hawaiian.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:30:21):**  And the Hawaiian name for the green horizon is Kula.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:30:29):**  And so that's where the name came, it made a lot of sense when he said it.

**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:30:36):**  Getting the chance to compare and contrast the science behind two companies looking to  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:30:40):**  define the future of nitrogen fertilizer was fascinating and has helped to shape our understanding  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:30:45):**  of how the whole crop nutrient space might evolve.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:30:48):**  First, I love that both Jupiter ionics and Kula are taking on the fertilizer challenge  
**[0:30:52-0:30:55](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:30:52):**  at a kind of first principles level.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:30:55):**  Rather than innovating on the margins of the existing industry, these companies and many  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:30:59):**  others see a specific defensible opportunity in creating a product that's decoupled from  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:31:04):**  fossil fuels, not only for the carbon benefit, but also to help farmers control prices and  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:31:09):**  be able to meaningfully participate in the efforts to reduce scope three emissions.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:31:13):**  Next, I appreciate the similar university lab origin story for these two companies.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:31:18):**  But even more, I think they've nailed an important lesson that many early ag tech companies missed,  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:31:23):**  which is that farmers both in the US and Australia and elsewhere prefer and prioritize products  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:31:29):**  that fit into their existing production system.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:31:32):**  We've seen a lot of interesting science and tech, probably some really world changing  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:31:36):**  stuff that because its creators didn't do the work to understand the market, never really  
**[0:31:41-0:31:42](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:31:41):**  made it off the bench.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:31:42):**  Finally, I think it's critical to appreciate that companies like both Jupiter and Kula  
**[0:31:47-0:31:50](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:31:47):**  are still really early in their journeys.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:31:50):**  Figuring out how to scale a fertilizer, as Charlie said, from grams to tons is no easy  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:31:54):**  task nor is getting it into farmers hands once it's made.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:31:59):**  I asked both Charlie and Bill about this, digging into questions around business models  
**[0:32:02-0:32:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:32:02):**  and go to market strategies.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:32:04):**  You'll hear more from them and from farmers and other experts next week when we bring  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:32:08):**  you part two of the future of N. In the meantime, if you're interested in learning more about

**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:32:17):**  check out the Future of Agriculture podcast with our friend Tim Hamrich.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:32:21):**  He did a recent episode featuring Nitricity, the company that Charlie referenced here.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:32:26):**  Before we say goodbye, I wanted to share a bit more of our Raising Out Loud journey.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:32:30):**  This week, we've been thinking about and answering a lot of questions about whether  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:32:34):**  ag tech is a fit for venture capital.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:32:36):**  To us, the answer is an emphatic yes, and we actually think it's becoming an even better  
**[0:32:40-0:32:43](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:32:40):**  space for venture all the time.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:32:43):**  As this series will illustrate, farm inputs and advice are transforming completely.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:32:48):**  Given everything we learned today, I think it's clear that today's common farm inputs  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:32:52):**  account for a significant amount of the emissions profile of agricultural production, that they're  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:32:56):**  getting more expensive and are susceptible to global shocks.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:33:00):**  Looking forward, there's an opportunity and an imperative to transition toward lower-intensity  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:33:04):**  production, including biological and digital replacements for synthetic inputs.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:33:09):**  This transition will be far from straightforward though, and ag-chem incumbents such as manufacturers  
**[0:33:15-0:33:18](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:33:15):**  and retailers will be pretty significantly impacted.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:24](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:33:18):**  As cells and bits replace molecules, incumbents will need different types of expertise to  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:33:24):**  transform not only product development, but also to shift from margin capture to service  
**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:33:30):**  delivery.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:33:31):**  A lot of this expertise is most likely going to come via acquisitions.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:33:35):**  But in addition to incumbents transitioning, these shifts may also create opportunities  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:33:39):**  for novel kinds of digitally native retailers to gain market share, companies that could  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:33:44):**  easily get to IPO scale focused on inputs alone.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/the-future-of-fertilizer-nitrogen-with-jupiter-ionics-and-kula-bio#t=0:33:48):**  There are a few other big factors driving ag tech exits and returns.

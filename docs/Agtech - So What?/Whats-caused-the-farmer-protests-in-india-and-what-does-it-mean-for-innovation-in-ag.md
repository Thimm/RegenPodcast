### Agtech - So What?  (2021-06-16)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to Ag Tech So What, brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  I'm Sarah Nolet.  Before we get started, I have a favorite ask.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:00:11):**  We work really hard to find interesting guests and create valuable content for you, but we  don't always know what's working and what's not.  So instead of guests, we thought we'd just ask you.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:00:21):**  If you could please fill out the survey we've linked in the show notes, we'd so appreciate  it.  And hopefully helping us get better will help you too.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:00:28):**  It will only take three minutes, I promise.  So thanks so much, and here's this week's episode.  I'd first like to introduce you to Kamal Patel, who's part of our team at the Agthentic Group.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:00:40):**  She's a principal advisor and also on our investment team at Tenacious Ventures.  Over the past few months, we've been watching the farmer protests in India with great concern,  but have found it hard to understand what's truly going on.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:00:54):**  While the protests have made headlines all over the world, most of the coverage has been  fairly superficial, at least in the Western world.  So we wanted to dig in.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:02):**  Kamal, who has lived and worked in India, has been on a bit of a fact-finding mission,  which started, of all places, on social media.  So it actually started with a tweet from Rihanna, as those stories do.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:16):**  So a few months ago, Rihanna tweeted an article that was about the protests in India and said,  why aren't we talking about this, and that generated a lot of attention.  And I think in many ways brought a lot of Western media attention to what was going  
**[0:01:33-0:01:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:33):**  on in India.  At that point, I think it was about two months into the farmer protests.  And so it blew up.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:40):**  More famous people started tweeting about it, and yeah, there was just more attention  to the farmer protests going on.  And I was struggling to reconcile a few things.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:51):**  So to be fair, Rihanna was commenting about how the Indian government had cut off internet  access to the farmers that were protesting in Delhi and fully understand the support  for farmers in terms of democratic rights and human rights.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:08):**  The thing that I was struggling to piece together was the idea of people saying, we stand with  farmers and the reforms are bad.  As my experience in India many years ago, looking at agricultural markets was like,  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:25):**  the system is broken and change is definitely needed.  So when I heard that reforms were coming into place, I was like, oh, maybe this could be  a good thing.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:34):**  And then seeing what I was seeing on social media, I was like, ah, it doesn't seem to  be adding up.  So yeah, I was like, maybe I need to talk to some people to figure out what's actually  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:43):**  going on.  It's really strikes me because we've been also talking about like myths and disinformation  and this is one of those ones where you're like, who do I trust?  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:52):**  Is what I'm seeing in the media actually happening and what do I believe?  And I think one of the challenges is to understand what actually is happening, you have to go  pretty deep.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:02):**  So what did you find?  Like was there a simple answer?  Was the policy good or bad or what actually happened?  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:07):**  So it's a really tricky question, complicated subject.  And I figured I wasn't going to get my answers on social media.  So I decided I needed to talk to an expert.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:17):**  Everybody was arguing that the current system was working.  Farmers who have even come here have said that was our lifeline, right?  They weren't, they are not saying that that system was great.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:28):**  So that was Meghalak Krishnamurthy, who is an associate professor of sociology and anthropology  at Ashoka University in India.  And she actually has spent a ton of time studying agricultural markets in India and was referred  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:44):**  to me as one of the most nuanced voices on this topic.  So I think the larger point that many people have been trying to make is that agricultural  reform requires a process.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:56):**  And we have to think about interventions that allow people to have really decent and sustainable  livelihoods while allowing them to make better choices, both on the farm and off the farm.  So one of the first things that Meghalak and I talked about was the difference in India's  
**[0:04:18-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:04:18):**  farming context compared to perhaps what we're more familiar with in terms of Western industrialized  system.  So one point is that India is a very small holder agrarian system, right?  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:04:32):**  There's 86% of farmers in India who cultivate less than two hectares, super, super small.  And even the large farmers in India, they might be cultivating something like 10 hectares,  which even by global standards, we would consider that to be a pretty small farm.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:04:48):**  The second thing that Meghalak talked to me about was the role of agriculture in India's  economy.  So agriculture is the largest sector of employment.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:04:58):**  It's the largest employer in the country.  And we have about 48%.  Now, this is on aggregate.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:05:04):**  So certain states have many more people dependent on agriculture, 60%, 70%, even higher.  So on aggregate, 48% of the population of India is dependent on agriculture.  But as a proportion of GDP, it has been shrinking.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:05:19):**  So estimates would say 15% to 17%, depending on the year, is from agriculture.  And if you add agribusiness, there are some estimates would say you take it up to 20%  or 25%.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:05:31):**  There's a very large number of Indians who are dependent on agriculture.  These are smallholders, and it's a shrinking part of the Indian economy.  Even those numbers are astounding.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:05:43):**  In Australia, I think ag is something like 3% of GDP, and in the US, it's something like  5%.  So getting up close to 50% is just unreal.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:05:53):**  Like thinking about what that means for how important ag is to society is just something  many Western countries have no conception of.  Yeah, it really is staggering just how many people are employed and the fact that it's  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:06:06):**  a shrinking part of the economy.  There's a big question of what are people transitioning out of agriculture into.  And I think related to the protests, that is part of the fear is like what happens to  
**[0:06:18-0:06:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:06:18):**  livelihoods when there's, I guess, change on the horizon in these markets.  And that's part of what's happening, right?  It's the market system itself that's actually changing?  
**[0:06:29-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:06:29):**  Yeah.  So another thing that is perhaps unique about India's agricultural markets, and this is  something that I didn't appreciate until I spent time in India looking at smallholder  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:06:41):**  livelihoods, is that agricultural trade takes place within what's called mondis, which are  agricultural markets and sale yards.  And so they're kind of official state often run yards that you have to be licensed to  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:06:58):**  be a buyer and that's where all the trade happens.  By and large, these mondis are how India's agricultural markets function.  And changes to that system is what's behind the protests.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:07:13):**  So the reforms that were brought in by the government were impacting how these mondis  operate.  So over the last 20 years, there has been a process of opening up these markets.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:07:27):**  Across most states in India, you could take a license to operate outside the formal market.  You could also set up your own private market yard.  But the big difference between the current laws and those previous antecedents was that  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:07:42):**  those laws meant that you did have to be regulated, right?  The current laws have opened up these market sites and it takes you into a little bit of  a complicated story because agricultural markets, because of their diversity, because of their  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:07:55):**  complexity and because they're so tied to production systems, they are things that the  Indian states and union territories have control over rather than the central government.  And so state governments had their own laws and what happened was that the central government  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:08:11):**  brought a single law for the whole country, which meant that the existing mondis could  continue to operate under state law.  But all the physical space around them was now freed up and deregulated.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:08:25):**  And anybody with a PAN card, which is a tax ID document, would actually engage in exchange  with farmers.  And so now actually what you have is a complete regulatory confusion because you have multiple  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:08:38):**  different kinds of areas, market areas and trade areas and different policies for each  area.  That's so interesting.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:08:46):**  It sounds like it wasn't necessarily the policy that was bad, but actually more how it was  rolled out or how it was implemented at the state level versus the federal level and taking  the different stakeholders on board.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:08:58):**  Is that kind of your sense?  Yeah, so I think there's probably an important distinction between the intent behind the  policy and the idea that reform is needed in the first place, which I think Mikala's  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:09:11):**  point is, yeah, broadly everyone who works in Indian agriculture kind of understands  that the old system wasn't great and it needs to be reformed.  The question then becomes how does it need to be reformed and what does that process  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:09:25):**  look like?  There's kind of a parallel to technology and how we talk about technology being rolled  out where there's maybe sometimes too much focus on the tech itself and less consideration  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:09:36):**  of the people that will be impacted, the different personas or kind of different stakeholders  that will actually matter in the industry and what their incentives and behaviors are.  And it sounds like that's maybe what the government was missing or that's why it's been so frustrating  
**[0:09:50-0:09:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:09:50):**  for people on the ground.  Yeah, and it's actually super complicated in India because there's so many different  types of farmers across the country.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:10:00):**  The agricultural systems and markets in various states are really different and viewing it  from the lens of social media, it seems like there is one Indian farmer, one type of Indian  farmer and all of them are protesting against this law.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:10:15):**  And it's actually not really the case.  It turns out that most of the farmers who have showed up to the capital in Delhi to  protest are from the northern states of Punjab and Haryana.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:10:26):**  That's actually where I went when I went to India.  So when I was doing my masters, I did a pretty detailed research project on transition from  conventional to organic farming in wheat in particular.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:10:38):**  And I went to Haryana in India and I guess one of the observations there for sure was  how small the farmers are, but there was also this minimum support price that had a huge  role in how farmers think about what they should grow and where they sell it and this  
**[0:10:54-0:10:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:10:54):**  government subsidy that came in.  And it seems like that would have to play a role here.  Yeah, so I think one important clarification is that the current reforms don't actually  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:11:03):**  change anything related to the minimum support price.  But the current reforms, I think, have made farmers who are really reliant on these incentives  and subsidies fearful that that change is on the horizon.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:11:18):**  Do you do away with minimum support prices and price intervention, floor prices, parity  prices?  What farmers are actually asking for is that you expand the system and that you give serious  
**[0:11:33-0:11:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:11:33):**  minimum support prices back to its procurement across more commodities and more crops.  And what that will do is take away the unfair incentive to grow food grains, right, or the  unwise incentive to grow food grains.

And other crops, whether it's maize, whether it's pulses, whether it's horticulture, does

So if you provided parity pricing and price support across more commodities, then would  you actually enable farmers to take better choices, both looking at nutrition and market  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:12:20):**  demand and looking at agroecological costs, right?  Now in theory, this would be great, except we know what happens when incentives become  fixed.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:12:30):**  So we have to think about reform transitions for different states.  And we have to think about interventions that allow people to have really decent and sustainable  livelihoods while allowing them to make better choices, both on the farm and off the farm.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:12:50):**  So one big debate in India is that if you give people too many price supports and other  things, they will not get off the farm, right?  Now my point there is you will get off the farm when the economy is giving you good jobs,  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:13:02):**  right?  So the idea that you should get off the farm anyway, even to a worse life, is simply not  something that farmers are going to accept, which is why they hold on to their land, even  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:13:15):**  as they diversify their sources of income.  Because that land is social security, it's economic security, it's a place where you  can go and grow your food.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:13:23):**  And we don't understand that enough.  So unless the rest of the economy grows in a way that supports farmers who do want to  give up agriculture for better livelihood, then it's not going to work.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:13:34):**  Like I know farmers who grow produce for themselves anyway, even though they are largely surplus  producing farmers, they also use a plot of land for their own consumption.  In India, we don't, I think, pay adequate attention to agriculture as the site of value.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:13:50):**  We think about it as the source or the site of welfare.  And there's a big difference.  And of course, welfare is important.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:13:58):**  Of course, security is important.  But unless we start thinking about it as a site of value creation, we will keep failing  agriculture.

We've got to think about how the private sector plays a role here.  And I know I was reading the AgFunder and Omnivore Ventures report recently about how  
**[0:14:29-0:14:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:14:29):**  much funding is going into Indian agri-food tech.  And even though it declined a little bit in 2020, probably largely due to COVID, there's  still over a billion dollars going in to agri-food tech startups and over 130 something deals

So I can't imagine that it's just policy that's changing or just policy that's driving what's  happening in India and the possible options for value creation for farmers.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:14:54):**  Yeah, I asked Makala about this as well in terms of what's the role of policy and what's  the role of tech in changing systems.  And we can take a listen to what she had to say about that.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:15:06):**  But I think the role of technology is a second order question to the fundamental shape of  the system.  That when you simply deregulate a market, if that market is already unequal, deregulation  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:15:22):**  tends to favor the powerful.  So in an unequal or asymmetric market, if you make the market less regulated, it doesn't  help the weaker parties here.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:15:32):**  And those are definitely farmers who are smaller actors and less able to negotiate and have  a whole range of structural constraints.  So that doesn't mean that you need an entirely state system.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:15:43):**  What you need is a system of good regulation.  And you need, in my view, well-directed public investment.  Because many of these cases are places where we've underinvested in, whether it's road  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:15:57):**  access, whether it's market development, whether it's basic infrastructure for the market,  whether it's in better public science.  Our agricultural universities have not been invested in over many, many years.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:16:09):**  These are the kinds of public investments that if the state makes, private actors are  usually very good at following up with private investment.  This often happens with irrigation systems.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:16:22):**  If the government invests in irrigation, and you have a public irrigation system, farmers  and other actors also then invest in the system.  So I think we need a system where the state plays a shaping role.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:16:36):**  And this is particularly important in agriculture, because it connects agroecological crises  and challenges on one side, and food and nutrition security on the other.  And India is a country where we still have the largest population in percentage proportion  
**[0:16:51-0:16:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:16:51):**  of stunted children.  We have still very, very enduring problems of food and nutrition security.  So making sure that those transitions are supported.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:17:02):**  So this is a role for public policy and the state.  Thinking about public value in agriculture is a critical role for the state.  And I think that's what people are saying, that it's not about don't open up, don't have  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:17:16):**  greater competition, don't have greater integration, but what is the right role for the state in  this context?  So I think Maykala's point that policy was the first order issue that needs to be solved  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:17:29):**  was well taken.  But I was also kind of curious to see if maybe someone who spends more of their time in the  world of ag tech had a different perspective on the role that technology would play in  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:17:40):**  reshaping India's agricultural system.  That's just a wicked subject, you know.  And the wicked comes from the term in complexity sciences, right?  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:17:49):**  Where problems that don't have a generalizable answer.  Ah, that's Venki.  He hosts the AgriTech Power Hour on Clubhouse with us.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:17:57):**  And he writes the AgriBusiness Matters newsletter.  Yeah.  And he actually had a really great analogy to help answer this question about the relative  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:18:06):**  roles of technology and policy when I asked him about this.  So to give a context about the metaphor is simple, right?  What games you play is determined by the playground.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:18:19):**  And you can see you can do this in countries like in I mean, you can do this at all levels  there.  If I think of what I think of a city as a playground, why did Amazon move to Seattle?  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:18:29):**  Or why did Boeing move to Seattle?  That's because of the various things that were shaped in Seattle, which became easier  for technology to come.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:18:35):**  Right.  So likewise, every playground, you know, how do you shape the playground and that's going  to determine what kind of games are going to play.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:18:44):**  And that's how the markets are going to come in and then there.  So right now, the fundamental challenge right now is we don't have good playgrounds yet  for technological games to play.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:18:53):**  So that's one of the reasons why the protests are happening.  So Venki is basically saying you need policy to set the rules for tech to come in and be  able to play a role, which makes sense.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:19:05):**  I also feel like though, we've also seen around the world where technology doesn't always  wait for the rules to be set, right?  Like a lot of times we're seeing technology is creating the need for new rules.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:19:17):**  So I think about Uber.  Governments never had to think about what the difference between shareriding and taxis  were before or how to regulate that market.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:19:27):**  But it was the entrepreneurs and the innovation that then forced a conversation around what  those rules should be and what the playground should look like.  So I think there is a bit of knowing that innovation isn't going to wait and when there  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:19:42):**  are opportunities either at the systemic level or because of just shocks that create new  opportunities as we've seen with COVID, entrepreneurs will jump on it.  If you really look back at the history of let's say Indian agricultural policy reforms,  
**[0:19:59-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:19:59):**  right from 1947 when India became independent until 2016, until then the entire agricultural  policy and reforms were largely supply focused.  How do I grow more?  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:20:11):**  How do I increase meat?  Now it's only after 2016 the focus shifted on a demand side.  Now how do I ensure that?

How do I increase the marketable surplus?  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:20:52):**  How do I ensure that I get a better price and what kind of export opportunities I get  from it?  And for that, prices need to be linked at scale.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:20:59):**  I'll give you a very classic scenario here.  Sometime back I was in Tamil Nadu where I was in a village in Coimbatore and I was talking  to a farmer who has been growing turmeric.

So there was a glut of turmeric in his farm and he didn't know how to sell.  So he had this glut and so for him, so he did all the best that he could.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:21:26):**  He contacted some certain people who bought certain parts of the produce.  He started also selling it to consumers over Facebook, but he still ended up having a lot  of produce that were lying without going to the market.

Now, when you have so many different agri climatic zones, and when you have farm sizes  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:23:16):**  that are small, and each of them are geographically distributed in a very, very dispersed way,  right?  So in that kind of a scenario, it's very natural to have at least three plus intermediaries  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:23:27):**  in the whole system.  And these intermediaries, you know, you can call them middlemen, or you can call them  our happy as in as they call them in India, and leave they play a very vital role of,  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:23:39):**  of bearing the principal risk involved in agriculture.  So they are fundamentally giving credit at the early stage of the input stage.  And then because they have given credit at that, and they have the first right of refusal  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:23:52):**  for the output produce, right?  So they then aggregate the produce and then send it off to their value chain and their  traders and sell off.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:24:01):**  So now, when you are talking about removing middlemen, you're not understanding the role  that they are actually playing in the system, you're not really understanding how they actually  eliminate in how they deal with the principal risk involved in agriculture, because at the  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:24:15):**  end of the day, agriculture is an extremely volatile activity.  So in that kind of one, you need a strong player who can bear the principal risk involved  in such kind of an occupation.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:24:26):**  Now the problem here is the startups who are who are largely talk about removing middlemen  oftentimes are not yet ready to bear the principal risk.  They are not yet scaled enough or they are not they don't have the capital pool enough  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:24:40):**  to offer a principal, you know, to have principal risk for their farmers.  So they also quite, you know, smart entrepreneurs quickly understand the game and they start  collaborating with few middlemen, and they do some types and so they get the produce  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:24:53):**  from the traders or the middlemen and so the game is going on.  But, but the ideology is very funny.  I remember when I went to India for that project, I guess had that same misconception that there  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:25:05):**  would be all these middlemen taking advantage of all these smallholder farmers and it just  wasn't the case.  Actually the group that showed us around Haryana and spent many days with us helping us do  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:25:15):**  the research and run these focus groups was a farmer producer organization.  And they were actually doing exactly what Venki says trying to help farmers transition  to premium crops and organic crops and bear some of that risk that some of these startups  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:25:29):**  are trying to come in and help with of this transition off of the minimum support price  or to some kind of new market where they can get a better premium or reduce their chemical  usage, improve their family health or whatever it might be, and actually trying to find ways  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:25:43):**  to bear that risk, whether they got sponsorships from local industrial companies or philanthropic  organizations.  And I was so, I guess maybe surprised to see how much trust he had.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:25:55):**  Like he set up all the meetings with the farmers and he brought us who had no business really  being there to enter people's homes and have time with their family and learn about this  difficult challenge they're making and switching off of what was a conventional crop.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:26:09):**  And so these middlemen that we kind of villainize in some ways just had so much trust in these  situations, which you can say is good or bad, but clearly it's a nuanced situation.  Yes.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:26:19):**  I think, I mean, I struggle with painting a rosy picture of it as well, right?  I think the reality is somewhere in between and right.  I mean, farmer suicides in India have been a really big issue and a lot of times that  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:26:33):**  has to do with the conditions of lending that they receive and things like that.  So I don't want to give the impression that middlemen are the saviors in the system by  any means.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:26:45):**  I think the point that Venki was making that really resonated with me is that any technical  solution that we bring in has to operate within the realities of the system, right?  And so the middlemen, be they good or bad, are playing an important role in the system  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:27:03):**  and where they're bearing the risk and you can't develop solutions that strip them out  completely without thinking about that context.  And May Kala actually made a similar point in talking about how we think about applying  
**[0:27:17-0:27:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:27:17):**  technology to agriculture in that agriculture at the end of the day is about the movement  of physical goods.  And a lot of times we think about technology in a hyper digital way.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:27:31):**  And I just thought that it was a really interesting reflection that she had as well.  I mean, I don't know if you're finding the same thing.  These are physical systems.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:27:39):**  These are material systems, which is why I said like, you know, old fashioned technology,  the way we think about technology, the bullock cart was a technology, the wheel was a technology,  the tractor is a technology, the old waybridge was one and the new ones are.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:27:56):**  The problem is like, at least in India, when you say tech, you mean digital.  And you don't mean technology anymore.  So the difference between is are you talking about digital technology?  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:28:10):**  Or are you talking about technology?  And all of us should be talking about technology.  People are like, farmers are selling on WhatsApp.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:28:17):**  And I'm like, that's great.  Is the grain also moving on WhatsApp?  How did the groundnut move?  
**[0:28:23-0:28:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:28:23):**  What is happening?  What are you eating?  Right.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:28:26):**  So I think we've forgotten all of this somewhere.  And in India, a lot of the discussion about the digital ecosystem, the ag tech ecosystem  is also hyper digitalized, and I think not material and embedded enough.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:28:41):**  So like, I always say the other thing with electronic markets is that they're apps in  search of platforms.  And the platform is physical.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:28:49):**  The platform is not digital, the platform is actually the physical marketing system.  So you're building apps without looking at the platform, but you're calling the app a  platform.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:28:59):**  It's not a platform, it's an app.  I imagine some investors would disagree with that in terms of platforms and what can exist  in the digital world.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:29:07):**  But I love that quote from Mikala about, did you move the grain on WhatsApp?  Like obviously that's not possible.  Yet we are seeing digital crops like carbon and water and some of these other opportunities  
**[0:29:17-0:29:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:29:17):**  come to bear.  And exactly to her point, you can't forget about the physical world, whether you're thinking  about technology or policy and agriculture.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:29:26):**  Yeah.  I love that quote and story from her.  And it really actually brings me back to where I started this whole journey, which is what  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:29:35):**  I was seeing through digital platforms didn't 100% line up with what I saw on the ground  when I was in India.  Right.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:29:42):**  Like so much backlash about the reforms are bad and we need to stand with farmers, which  I understand in terms of, again, the democratic rights and all of that.  But the idea that change was bad for the farmers and therefore we should be against whatever  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:29:57):**  the reform is.  Right.  And that's just connected from my understanding of reality on the ground.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:30:02):**  I guess it just reinforces that when we're talking about systems change, whether from  a policy level or a technology level, it has to be rooted in the realities of the people,  the incentives, the behaviors, and the structures that they operate within.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:30:20):**  I'm so glad you went down this rabbit hole, Combs, because I think there's insights for  us, whether we're sitting in Australia or the US as well.  Basically what you said, how do we design policies or technologies actually in context  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:30:33):**  of how supply chains work, as well as thinking about how they can work in the future.  And just a warning that we can't believe everything we see on social media and digging into these  issues and understanding from a boots on the ground perspective and asking experts highlights  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:30:48):**  or reveals such a different view of what the world looks like.  And that's just increasingly true as digital technology kind of pervades everything we  do.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:30:56):**  We just don't always have the real story.  Yeah, I think that is definitely a takeaway.  And for me, it was really trying to understand, well, what does it actually mean to stand  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:31:06):**  with farmers opposing this particular policy in the way that it was brought in is one thing.  But really, if we want to support farmers, we need to think about how do we move forward  and how do we change the systems with the various tools in our toolkit.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:31:21):**  I guess a final reflection is also, you know, the protests actually just hit their six month  mark this week.  And there's not really any clarity on where things go from here.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:31:33):**  I think everyone can at least agree on the idea that we need change.  And hopefully we find a way to come together and figure out how to meaningfully and impactfully  enable that change to happen.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:31:50):**  And that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.

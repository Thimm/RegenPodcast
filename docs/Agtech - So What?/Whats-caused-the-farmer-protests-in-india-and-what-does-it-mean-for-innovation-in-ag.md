**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:00:35):**  I'd first like to introduce you to Kamal Patel, who's part of our team at the Agthentic Group.

**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:00:50):**  but have found it hard to understand what's truly going on.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:00:54):**  While the protests have made headlines all over the world, most of the coverage has been  
**[0:00:57-0:01:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:00:57):**  fairly superficial, at least in the Western world.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:00):**  So we wanted to dig in.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:02):**  Kamal, who has lived and worked in India, has been on a bit of a fact-finding mission,  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:06):**  which started, of all places, on social media.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:10):**  So it actually started with a tweet from Rihanna, as those stories do.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:16):**  So a few months ago, Rihanna tweeted an article that was about the protests in India and said,  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:23):**  why aren't we talking about this, and that generated a lot of attention.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:29):**  And I think in many ways brought a lot of Western media attention to what was going  
**[0:01:33-0:01:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:33):**  on in India.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:34):**  At that point, I think it was about two months into the farmer protests.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:38):**  And so it blew up.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:40):**  More famous people started tweeting about it, and yeah, there was just more attention  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:45):**  to the farmer protests going on.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:47):**  And I was struggling to reconcile a few things.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:51):**  So to be fair, Rihanna was commenting about how the Indian government had cut off internet  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:01:58):**  access to the farmers that were protesting in Delhi and fully understand the support  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:03):**  for farmers in terms of democratic rights and human rights.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:08):**  The thing that I was struggling to piece together was the idea of people saying, we stand with  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:14):**  farmers and the reforms are bad.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:19):**  As my experience in India many years ago, looking at agricultural markets was like,  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:25):**  the system is broken and change is definitely needed.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:29):**  So when I heard that reforms were coming into place, I was like, oh, maybe this could be  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:33):**  a good thing.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:34):**  And then seeing what I was seeing on social media, I was like, ah, it doesn't seem to  
**[0:02:38-0:02:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:38):**  be adding up.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:40):**  So yeah, I was like, maybe I need to talk to some people to figure out what's actually  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:43):**  going on.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:45):**  It's really strikes me because we've been also talking about like myths and disinformation  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:49):**  and this is one of those ones where you're like, who do I trust?  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:52):**  Is what I'm seeing in the media actually happening and what do I believe?  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:02:56):**  And I think one of the challenges is to understand what actually is happening, you have to go  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:01):**  pretty deep.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:02):**  So what did you find?  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:03):**  Like was there a simple answer?  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:04):**  Was the policy good or bad or what actually happened?  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:07):**  So it's a really tricky question, complicated subject.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:10):**  And I figured I wasn't going to get my answers on social media.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:13):**  So I decided I needed to talk to an expert.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:17):**  Everybody was arguing that the current system was working.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:20):**  Farmers who have even come here have said that was our lifeline, right?  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:24):**  They weren't, they are not saying that that system was great.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:28):**  So that was Meghalak Krishnamurthy, who is an associate professor of sociology and anthropology  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:35):**  at Ashoka University in India.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:38):**  And she actually has spent a ton of time studying agricultural markets in India and was referred  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:44):**  to me as one of the most nuanced voices on this topic.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:49):**  So I think the larger point that many people have been trying to make is that agricultural  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:53):**  reform requires a process.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:03:56):**  And we have to think about interventions that allow people to have really decent and sustainable  
**[0:04:05-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:04:05):**  livelihoods while allowing them to make better choices, both on the farm and off the farm.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:04:13):**  So one of the first things that Meghalak and I talked about was the difference in India's  
**[0:04:18-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:04:18):**  farming context compared to perhaps what we're more familiar with in terms of Western industrialized  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:04:25):**  system.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:04:26):**  So one point is that India is a very small holder agrarian system, right?  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:04:32):**  There's 86% of farmers in India who cultivate less than two hectares, super, super small.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:04:38):**  And even the large farmers in India, they might be cultivating something like 10 hectares,  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:04:43):**  which even by global standards, we would consider that to be a pretty small farm.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/6/16/whats-caused-the-farmer-protests-in-india-and-what-does-it-mean-for-innovation-in-ag#t=0:04:48):**  The second thing that Meghalak talked to me about was the role of agriculture in India's

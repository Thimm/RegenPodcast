**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:00:12):**  in collaboration with the Future Farmers Network.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:00:16):**  Let's face it, Ag Tech as an industry barely existed even five years ago, so there's not  
**[0:00:21-0:00:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:00:21):**  really a well-worn path to break into the industry.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:00:24):**  I'm guessing it wasn't on the radar of your high school career counselor.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:00:28):**  So to kick off our series, we're looking at breaking into agriculture and Ag Tech and  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:00:32):**  what it takes, especially when you haven't grown up on a farm or when, as some of our  
**[0:00:37-0:00:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:00:37):**  guests today say, you don't look the part.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:00:40):**  What does that mean?  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:00:41):**  Well, our four guests are all women of color, and today they share their stories and advice  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:00:47):**  on breaking into Ag Tech.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:00:50):**  Early days, it was a few cases of mistaken identity, particularly with China's influence  
**[0:00:54-0:00:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:00:54):**  in the wool industry.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:00:55):**  It was, you know, are you linked to one of the mills?  
**[0:00:58-0:00:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:00:58):**  Are you someone's daughter?  
**[0:00:59-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:00:59):**  Are you a foreign exchange student?  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:01:02):**  So while I think that, you know, some of the barriers that I'd faced initially getting  
**[0:01:07-0:01:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:01:07):**  into the industry was tough and was challenging, I think that there are now some incredible  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:01:14):**  opportunities, especially for young people in agriculture, to make an impact and difference  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:01:18):**  and elevate their voice in the industry.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:01:22):**  That last voice you heard is Reale Banerjee.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:01:24):**  He's now the communications manager for Syngenta across Australia and New Zealand.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:01:29):**  But getting into agriculture in the first place certainly wasn't easy.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:01:33):**  And how Reale did it is one of the more intelligent and downright brave ways I've ever heard.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:01:39):**  You'll hear that story in a moment.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:01:40):**  But first, this is Reale on why she became so passionate about Ag in the first place.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:01:46):**  I was actually born in India, and then I actually grew up in Malaysia and Singapore for about  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:01:51):**  eight years before moving to Melbourne back in 2003.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:01:57):**  So my actual exposure into the agriculture industry actually started when I was about  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:02:02):**  13 years old.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:02:04):**  And it was when my family took me back for a trip to India, to the eastern part of India,  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:02:10):**  which is which is where I was born.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:02:12):**  And we were visiting a few temples in the countryside.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:02:14):**  And on the way back home, we stopped by a smallholder farming village.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:02:19):**  So I hopped out of the car and at such a young age, I was interacting with these farmers  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:02:23):**  who were expressing their real sorrow about the tough time that they were going through  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:02:29):**  on their farm because they didn't have access to good quality seeds, machinery, and there  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:02:35):**  was basically a bit of not a lot of support from the government.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:02:40):**  And so they were really struggling to feed their families.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:02:43):**  And as a 13 year old, I always questioned why it was that in Australia, we have access  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:02:49):**  to fresh food, water, and smallholder farmers in developing countries really struggle to  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:02:53):**  feed their families.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:02:55):**  And so growing up, I did a lot of humanitarian work.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:02:58):**  And when it came to choosing a career, I wanted to choose something that I knew I would have  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:03:04):**  a direct impact on society and the environment.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:03:08):**  Royale went on to study agricultural sciences and business at university and loved it.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:03:13):**  But one thing was different for her.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:03:15):**  I was pretty much the only person in my year who was not from a farm.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:03:21):**  So it was pretty challenging because I remember having a chat with my peers and they'd be  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:03:27):**  having, they'd almost have this language that is spoken in Ag.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:03:33):**  And I wouldn't really know what they were talking about or necessarily understand some  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:03:38):**  of the concepts.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:03:39):**  Like I didn't even really know what it meant to have a yarn.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:03:41):**  So yeah, it was, I was pretty much the only person with a non-farming background.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:03:47):**  And that was pretty challenging, actually.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:03:49):**  So other than the jargon, that is definitely true.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:03:55):**  Was it difficult because of like, you don't get it or you're not really in this or that  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:03:59):**  kind of thing or just more difficult because of that jargon and you didn't really understand  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:03):**  like all the different terms?  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:05):**  Both.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:06):**  So I would say definitely there was a cultural piece.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:09):**  Like I'd never grown up in a country or in the country or on a farm.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:13):**  There was, yeah, the jargon piece, but also I didn't have an understanding of farming  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:17):**  systems either.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:19):**  So yeah, it was a mix of everything.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:21):**  But what I was really wanting was hands-on experience.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:25):**  It was great to experience it in the classroom, but I wanted to get my hands dirty because  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:29):**  I felt that's what Ag is all about.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:31):**  You know, really understanding what's happening on the ground and on farm.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:35):**  So did you manage to do that?  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:37):**  Yeah, I did.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:38):**  It was really challenging at first.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:39):**  I mean, throughout the first year of university, it was so tough because I would reach out  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:45):**  to potential like industry placements.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:48):**  I would try and find opportunities to get that experience.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:53):**  I didn't know anyone in the industry.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:55):**  I didn't have any connections.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:04:58):**  And when I kept getting rejected, I felt that the opportunities were, yeah, mostly for people  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:05:07):**  who came from that background and had that sort of knowledge.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:05:11):**  And so what I did to overcome that is I actually ended up creating my own opportunities.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:05:18):**  She certainly did make her own opportunities.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:05:20):**  This is the story I mentioned before of how Reale got into Ag.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:05:24):**  I still got told that I didn't have the necessary skills.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:05:29):**  And the biggest part of my journey into the industry that I found a challenge was that  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:05:32):**  I look different to the average person and working in the Ag space.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:05:38):**  So for me, it was all about building my own brand in the industry.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:05:45):**  So I did everything from, of course, a big part of it was research.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:05:49):**  So I Googled every single conference, every single networking event that I could possibly  
**[0:05:55-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:05:55):**  get myself along to so that I could not only share my passion, but so I could hear stories  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:02):**  from other people, other leaders in the industry who've made such incredible impacts.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:08):**  So I remember there was one specific conference I wanted to get along to, to meet some of  
**[0:06:13-0:06:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:13):**  the different leaders in the Agribusiness and Ag innovation space.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:16):**  And I Googled the conference.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:18):**  It was $3,000 and I was 21 and broke.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:22):**  And I thought, how am I ever going to get myself along to something like this?  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:25):**  And so what I did was I actually ended up calling up the conference organizers who were  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:30):**  based in Hong Kong and New York at the time.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:32):**  And it was a couple of hundred extra dollars to my phone bill.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:35):**  But I said to them, you know, this is who I am.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:37):**  This is why I want to come.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:38):**  And they let me come along.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:40):**  And it's that, it's at that conference where I truly feel like it was a life changing moment.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:45):**  Because it's where my, yeah, it really was.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:49):**  What happened at the conference?  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:50):**  What was so exciting about it?  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:52):**  What was so exciting about it?  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:53):**  Well, I was the youngest person in the room.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:06:54):**  In a room filled with CEOs and international leaders in the Agribusiness and Ag innovation  
**[0:07:00-0:07:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:07:00):**  space.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:07:01):**  And it was, it was like almost like an open book because it was an opportunity for me  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:07:07):**  to soak in all of this information on all of this knowledge and then actually do something  
**[0:07:13-0:07:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:07:13):**  with it.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:07:14):**  So what I did was I made my way around listening to the stories of each of these incredible  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:07:20):**  leaders and it was a pretty daunting, it was a pretty daunting experience because I didn't  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:07:24):**  have nearly enough insights that I could share back.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:07:27):**  But what I found really surprising was that these leaders in the Ag space were really  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:07:32):**  keen to share their knowledge and share their learnings.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:07:36):**  And I took all of that away and I continued keeping, keeping those connections.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:07:43):**  That's a theme you'll hear a lot in this episode, the importance of mentors and building  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:07:47):**  your network of connections.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:07:50):**  Sam Wan, the other voice you heard in the intro, found a key mentor very early on who  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:07:54):**  actually steered her in the direction of agriculture.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:07:57):**  Now Sam is an award winning wool broker for elders.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:01):**  But growing up in a city, she says she barely understood where food and fiber actually came  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:05):**  from.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:06):**  So I'm originally from Blacktown out of Western Sydney and I'm first generation  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:11):**  Australian born.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:12):**  I started in with the local high school that had a hat full of black corrodile sheep that  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:17):**  used to get toted around to schools.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:19):**  I thought for a long while I wanted to go into IT and it just so happened a teacher  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:24):**  at the right time in the right place headed me off on a different direction.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:28):**  And now I find myself working in the Australian wool industry, which is pretty incredible.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:32):**  Or is there a moment when wool was put on the radar and you started to go down that  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:36):**  path?  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:37):**  Unfortunately, I don't think I can really pinpoint it.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:40):**  At some point it really got under my skin and it hasn't left.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:42):**  So after high school, uni was expected, particularly in the Australian kind of Chinese more so.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:48):**  The culture there is you're expected to go to university.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:52):**  So I went to Sydney uni and did a degree in Ag science.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:55):**  I very much enjoyed more the on farm.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:08:57):**  I had a little trouble writing reports and getting focused on that front.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:09:01):**  So it took every opportunity to go on farm and do more, seeing the hands on practical  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:09:05):**  elements of what agriculture was doing and how different things like small changes could  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:09:10):**  influence a bigger scope.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:09:12):**  I did take some time off and did a cert four in agriculture at TAFE just to get more of  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:09:17):**  that grounding hands on, spend some time in cattle yards.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:09:20):**  And that really, I think, cemented it through once seeing it really on the ground.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:09:25):**  And then the opportunities once one door opened, it was really a case of finding out so much  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:09:30):**  more could be done and using the skills that I picked up in understanding some of the IT  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:09:35):**  systems has really, really come to the forefront now as agriculture evolves.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:09:40):**  What was that like your first time on a farm?  
**[0:09:42-0:09:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:09:42):**  Like was the farm like you thought it would be?  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:09:45):**  So one of my favorite things to tell people is I used to think that corned beef came from  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:09:49):**  a can until I'd had actual corned beef.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:09:52):**  So that still sticks with me.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:09:53):**  And I still have canned corned beef in the cupboard for different kind of dishes.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:09:57):**  It was different because I remember going out to the petting zoos in Sydney that are  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:01):**  still around and enjoying that connection to the animals and thought, you know, the  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:05):**  animals were something great.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:06):**  But then once you saw the whole network of how everything between the plants, the animals  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:11):**  and the water and one kind of synergy, I think that's all.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:16):**  There was no one point at all.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:18):**  It really just all came together in one hit.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:21):**  Were people accepting of you coming out to farms?  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:24):**  Like what was it like for you?  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:25):**  You know, like it's kind of a different world than like asking, I know for me asking silly  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:29):**  questions of like not knowing how stuff works.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:31):**  And yeah, what was that like?  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:33):**  I guess I've had some really great mentors who were, crept me up and I have never been  
**[0:10:38-0:10:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:38):**  afraid of asking the stupid questions.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:40):**  I guess it really comes down to learning.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:43):**  Early days, it was a few cases of mistaken identity, particularly with China's influence  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:48):**  in the wool industry.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:49):**  It was, you know, are you linked to one of the mills?  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:51):**  Are you someone's daughter?  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:53):**  Are you a foreign exchange student?  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:54):**  So it was great to kind of put people on the back, not the back foot in a bad way, but  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:10:59):**  got them to stop it and think a little bit further about how the industry is evolving.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:11:04):**  That's the unpleasant side of agriculture.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:11:07):**  And while as Sam says, things are evolving, racism, unfortunately still does exist in  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:11:12):**  the industry.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:11:13):**  Reale says when she was first starting out in her career, it would cause her to doubt  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:11:18):**  herself.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:11:20):**  Couple of examples I can think of is walking into a farm or a regional town where I was  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:11:27):**  meeting a couple of people from the industry and having comments thrown at me like, oh,  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:11:33):**  you weren't, you don't look like what I was expecting or, cause I, you know, obviously  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:11:37):**  have an Australian accent, you know, I would say I'm definitely Australian of course, with  
**[0:11:42-0:11:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:11:42):**  an Indian background.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:11:43):**  And so that immediately sometimes would put a doubt in my mind that, you know, okay, I'm  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:11:50):**  not what they were expecting.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:11:51):**  Can I perform or can I meet expectations?  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:11:56):**  And that self doubt, I overcame that self doubt really quickly because what, I mean,  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:12:00):**  I've always had a growth mindset and every time I've had setbacks or I've had a failure,  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:12:05):**  I always pick myself up and I say, you know what, I'm going to take this as a learning  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:12:09):**  lesson and I'm going to go on to the next experience.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:12:13):**  Did it ever make you question, like did any of those, those barriers you've talked about  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:12:16):**  make you question whether you wanted to be in agriculture?  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:12:20):**  It never made me question if I ever wanted to be in agriculture because I'm so passionate  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:12:25):**  about the industry, but it made me question myself.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:12:28):**  It made me doubt my capabilities and my part, my own passion, my own knowledge.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:12:33):**  And there were certainly times when I felt so low because I had gone through these experiences  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:12:40):**  of being called out for looking different or maybe not understanding something because  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:12:44):**  I hadn't had the exposure.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:12:46):**  But even though, yes, those were negative experiences, I had gone through these negative  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:12:52):**  feelings and feelings of self-doubt.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:12:56):**  The flip side and the other side of the coin is that I had incredible mentors and incredible  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:01):**  people in the industry supporting me along the way and telling me that, no, you can do  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:06):**  it.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:07):**  Don't listen to people who ever tell you you can't do something.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:10):**  There's little aspects that kind of pinch that you remember, but I think you definitely  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:15):**  grow from them.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:16):**  You learn how to, and it's in your own personal development as well, it's in yourself how  
**[0:13:21-0:13:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:21):**  you learn to react to that.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:23):**  And I definitely had that in the first couple of years, that elevator pitch very much prepared  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:27):**  to explain the who, why, why I was here and why I was interested.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:32):**  There is in every industry, you are going to have some pockets that aren't as receptive  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:36):**  to others, but it really just lets you focus on those positive individuals that want to  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:40):**  give you a chance.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:41):**  And look, if you're there to improve, then if they don't want to take you on board, they're  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:45):**  the ones who are missing out.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:47):**  But being, I guess, pigeonholed into not understanding because I'm not looking a certain way before  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:54):**  I've even gotten the chance to open my mouth is a very hard thing to go through.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:13:58):**  I think even in the wool industry, there is talk about wool and ag, but I'm again fortunate  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:04):**  that there's been some absolute ground breakers who have come through the industry but haven't  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:08):**  closed that door.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:10):**  So I don't think it's really so much a girl thing.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:13):**  I think it is just looking a little different on the ground, but look, you can eventually  
**[0:14:19-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:19):**  get over that.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:20):**  It just stings a little bit.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:21):**  Well, I appreciate you sharing that story, Sam.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:23):**  I think the idea that ag is receptive and there are really good people, but I believe  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:28):**  increasingly strongly in calling out the bad actors and helping ag to question when things  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:34):**  can and should be different and when we're maybe not helping to make them different as  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:38):**  quickly enough.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:39):**  So appreciate you sharing that story.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:40):**  Do you remember what your elevator pitch was or has been?  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:43):**  I actually like use that tactic for sure to have the like one liner of why I'm here and  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:47):**  build credibility in one sentence.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:49):**  Do you remember what you said?  
**[0:14:50-0:14:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:50):**  Gosh, not really.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:51):**  And I think I still have to have those elevator pitches when I'm dealing now with different  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:55):**  external companies and things like that.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:14:57):**  I vaguely remember it being, because I think it was being in uni and it was essentially,  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:02):**  I was a uni student.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:04):**  My interest is in agriculture and I want to be able to see how things work and why decisions  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:08):**  are made.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:09):**  Cool.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:10):**  Got to keep it brief otherwise they stop listening.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:14):**  Our next guest says difference is very much a good thing.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:17):**  You might already know her.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:18):**  It's Cass Mow.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:19):**  She's part of our team here at the I-thendic Group, working in impact investing for Tenacious  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:24):**  Ventures and running boot camps with producers for farmers to founders.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:28):**  Unlike Reali and Sam, Cass didn't start out with a strong passion for agriculture, although  
**[0:15:33-0:15:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:33):**  I think she's building one.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:35):**  She landed in the ag tech world through working with startups.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:38):**  So Tenacious Ventures, we mostly spend our time talking to startups and hearing the pitches  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:44):**  of companies who are building technology that they want to bring to the agriculture industry.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:49):**  And then on the other side, we have farmers founders, which is focused on delivering programs  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:53):**  to support producers to take a leading role in creating and adopting innovation.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:15:58):**  So on that side, it's a lot of, it used to be a lot of traveling around the country,  
**[0:16:02-0:16:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:16:02):**  going to regional towns, running workshops, talking about tech and starting companies  
**[0:16:08-0:16:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:16:08):**  and how to do it and why you might and what could go wrong.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:16:11):**  So super different ends of the spectrum in terms of the Tenacious side is pretty classic  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:16:15):**  kind of tech conferences and Silicon Valley jargon and talking about exit multiples.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:16:21):**  And the farmers founders side is eating barbecue in a small regional town and starting to grow  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:16:27):**  as about how the season's going.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:16:29):**  Pretty big difference.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:16:31):**  And how do you find like personally that balance of kind of one foot in both of those worlds?  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:16:37):**  I get told by both sides that I talk too quickly.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:16:39):**  So at least there's some middle ground.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:16:41):**  I really like it.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:16:43):**  The grower side, I think I found, I think actually in both worlds, it can be challenging  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:16:47):**  to be a young Chinese woman for sometimes similar and sometimes different reasons.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:16:52):**  I mean, I think I'm someone who likes a challenge.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:16:55):**  I think in both the tech world and in the ag world, I felt sometimes out of place or  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:17:00):**  like I don't necessarily belong there and needing to kind of overcome that sensation  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:17:05):**  and step up and be confident and talk to people even despite that, I think is a pretty defining  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:17:10):**  part of being a young person in an industry.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:17:13):**  So what's the story I can tell?  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:17:15):**  We spent a lot of time going out and running workshops and you turn off at a workshop and  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:17:20):**  whatever you imagine agriculture to look like, it's often like a bunch of older guys, I would  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:17:25):**  say who are predominantly white and turning up and setting up your MacBook laptop with  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:17:31):**  your manicured nails from the city and your high-heeled boots is usually a funny moment.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:17:37):**  We work really hard to occupy a space which is recognizing that we're different, recognizing  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:17:42):**  that we're bringing a perspective which isn't I'm your mate from down the road and we share  
**[0:17:47-0:17:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:17:47):**  the same experience as the world and we know the same things.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:17:49):**  I think there's a lot of value in saying, look, we come from a totally different part  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:17:53):**  of the world.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:17:54):**  We see totally different things.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:17:55):**  We really care about doing a good job and we want to get it right but we're not pretending  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:00):**  to be like you.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:01):**  I'm not putting on the clothes and acting as if I grew up in agriculture because I didn't.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:07):**  So I would say sometimes that goes well.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:10):**  People appreciate like, hey, there's young people who have no particular reason to be  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:14):**  interested in this who are out here doing this stuff and visiting farms and putting  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:19):**  in the long hours driving around and they see the value of that and appreciate it.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:23):**  And there's people who are like, who are you?  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:26):**  Like why are you?  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:28):**  You've got the tech world and the agriculture world but then ag tech kind of sits in between  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:32):**  the two.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:33):**  Do you think that that requires different skills or different perspectives or is attracting  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:39):**  different kinds of talent like you mentioned impact before?  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:42):**  Is there anything in that niche that's different than tech and ag?  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:46):**  Yeah, I think it's hard to comment without seeming biased.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:51):**  I think once you're in a space and you see everything through the lens of that space,  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:54):**  but it does for sure feel like agriculture and regenerative ag and people being vegetarian,  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:18:59):**  like that kind of whole big theme around ethical consumption, I would say is bleeding into  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:19:05):**  average people's lives and their general awareness, even in kind of like my social circles and  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:19:11):**  age group.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:19:13):**  But the kinds of people who are drawn to actually working in ag, I think you have to commit  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:19:18):**  for the long flow.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:19:19):**  Like there's a lot of work I would say to build relationships, to learn about the space  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:19:23):**  because it is so complex and so varied and it doesn't have necessarily the same sex appeal  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:19:28):**  as it were of other spaces in tech like fintech or medtech or whatever, where it's kind of  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:19:33):**  very established and loved by investors for being fast to scale and blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:19:39):**  Like I think ag tech is getting sexier, but it probably attracts someone who is willing  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:19:45):**  to put in like a different kind of effort and a longer period of commitment perhaps.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:19:51):**  And that's something that all of our guests agree on.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:19:54):**  Once you get into ag, it's hard to leave.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:19:56):**  For those born into the industry, they say it's in their blood.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:00):**  For those of us to join later, it must somehow seep in.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:03):**  I know for me, a big part of my passion for ag is the people I get to work with in this  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:07):**  industry.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:08):**  And in terms of a career, agriculture is very much based on connections, but knowing how  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:14):**  to make those connections can be slightly different to other industries.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:18):**  Here's Cass again.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:19):**  I think that there's a lot of people on the tech side who want to get into ag or want  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:24):**  to meet growers and find it really hard.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:26):**  And then I think on the other side as well that there's growers who really want to adopt  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:29):**  tech and really want to better understand it and find things to use and find it really  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:34):**  difficult.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:35):**  So there's definitely a translation discovery problem in the middle, which is not to say  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:39):**  that the tools don't exist, but that I think we assume that the tools that exist to help  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:44):**  find things like that work.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:45):**  And I don't think that they do.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:47):**  The fact of the matter is that on both sides and between the two sides, like in most places,  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:52):**  the way we find out things is through our social network and your access to someone  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:20:57):**  who's well connected, basically I think will determine how easy it is for you to get into  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:21:02):**  that world and find out.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:21:04):**  So I think that you can do a bunch of networking or connecting.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:21:08):**  I think going from, I'm someone who's not in ag and I want to get into ag, I'm going  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:21:13):**  to reach out directly to farmers in Emerald, you're going to find really hard.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:21:17):**  It's almost certainly the case that what you want to do is find someone who's in the world  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:21:21):**  of ag tech who has those connections.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:21:24):**  You have to go multiple steps through the network to get there, which is exactly how  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:21:28):**  you'd approach trying to get a job in a company that you want to get a job at Salesforce,  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:21:32):**  you don't know anyone at Salesforce, you work out how many degrees of separation you are  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:21:36):**  from someone who can help you get in.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:21:38):**  It's the same thing I think in ag, just taking a strategic approach to moving towards  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:21:43):**  where you're trying to get.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:21:45):**  Cass says you also need to be prepared to spend the time to build and earn trust with  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:21:49):**  farmers and others in the ag industry.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:21:51):**  So a lot of the way that we'll run workshops is we'll find people in the local area that  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:21:56):**  we want to go to, we'll basically send an email, pick up the phone and say who we are  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:01):**  and what we want to do.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:03):**  And you get people who are receptive and you get people who aren't and it's just doing  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:07):**  it until someone says yes.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:09):**  But the kinds of reception you get are like come and stay on the farm and run this workshop  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:14):**  in our old barn and we'll see who we can get together and several make cookies.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:20):**  Like it's proper kind of country hospitality often, which is great.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:23):**  And then it's turning up there and knowing that like often it's not going to be the workshop  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:27):**  where you're going to get lots of engagement and deliver lots of value and get a lot of  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:31):**  trust.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:32):**  Like it's almost never the case.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:33):**  But actually you really need to stick around and chat to people for half an hour, an hour,  
**[0:22:40-0:22:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:40):**  three hours after the workshop.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:41):**  And that's where they'll actually be like, so tell us about this thing that you do.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:45):**  And you're like, oh, you just came to a workshop for three hours, but you're not quite sure  
**[0:22:49-0:22:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:49):**  what it was about.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:50):**  Great.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:51):**  Let me try again.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:52):**  And it's in those one-on-one conversations that you actually get kind of like, oh, that's  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:56):**  really interesting.  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:57):**  Or I actually know this person.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:22:59):**  Oh, have you thought about this?  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:23:00):**  And so in some ways it's like turning up in the community and actually spending the time.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:23:04):**  It's like a conference, right?

**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:23:08):**  You're really mostly there for the networking.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:23:10):**  And so just having the ability to stick around and have the slow conversations of what feels  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:23:16):**  like small talk to build trust is really, I would say the door opener long term.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:23:20):**  One of the things that's interesting about Ag that we've talked a little bit about is  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:23:23):**  how you're not often like sending emails and setting up Zoom calls.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:23:28):**  It's like text and phone and like even different forms of communication.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:23:32):**  Has that been your experience?  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:23:34):**  I think that it's probably actually drastically different post-COVID.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:23:37):**  It would be, I wish there was some kind of longitudinal way to look at how people have  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:23:41):**  adopted technology in the last six months, but definitely emails and so on.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:23:46):**  Not the best way to reach people before and probably still not the best way, but I think  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:23:49):**  willingness to get on telecoms to let out things for the first time is higher for sure.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:23:55):**  Rayali actually ran her own networking sessions outside of work to build connections in Ag  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:24:00):**  and Ag Tech for herself and for other young people.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:24:04):**  So just in terms of on the people breaking into the Ag Tech or Ag industry, I actually  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:24:09):**  ran my own initiative called Ag Bootcamps for a couple of years.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:24:13):**  And it was something that I took as a learning out of university because going through university  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:24:19):**  was so tough being new to the industry to actually break in.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:24:25):**  And so the whole purpose of Ag Bootcamps was to help connect students who were from diverse  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:24:31):**  backgrounds, not only culturally or linguistically, but also from, they might've been studying  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:24:36):**  engineering or science or IT and they were trying to get experience in agriculture.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:24:41):**  And this was so rewarding for me because I had one woman actually reach out to me on  
**[0:24:46-0:24:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:24:46):**  LinkedIn one day and say, I've just arrived from overseas and I'm studying a degree in  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:24:54):**  agriculture, but I'm really struggling to get experience because of my accent.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:24:59):**  And that should never be a barrier as to why someone is offered an opportunity.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:25:05):**  Because to me, when I actually connected this young woman with a business that actually  
**[0:25:10-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:25:10):**  ended up providing her with some work experience, she had incredible knowledge of international  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:25:17):**  Ag markets that she could bring in to this business and provide value that way.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:25:22):**  Yes, she was new to the whole culture that we have in the Ag industry, but that should  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:25:28):**  have never been the reason why she didn't get an opportunity.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:25:31):**  So I still, I don't run Ag Bootcamps as much as I did, but I still am really passionate  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:25:38):**  about making those connections and helping young people to make those connections.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:25:43):**  Because I look back on my journey and I would say that thanks to my mentors, I've really  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:25:49):**  been able to accelerate my career in the Ag industry and I really want to look back and  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:25:54):**  help other people do the same thing.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:25:57):**  In terms of advice to young people considering a career in Ag or Ag Tech, she's not the only  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:26:04):**  one passionate about helping others in their Ag Tech careers.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:26:07):**  Amy Wu is a California based journalist who has spent the last five years writing the  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:26:12):**  stories of female entrepreneurs in agriculture and Ag Tech.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:26:17):**  And now Amy has a website dedicated to this called From Farms to Incubators and a book  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:26:22):**  that's coming out soon.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:26:23):**  Amy started this whole initiative because there were too many untold stories of women  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:26:28):**  in this industry.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:26:30):**  I was a reporter covering agriculture and local government in Salinas, California.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:26:35):**  I think it was 2016 I was assigned there.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:26:38):**  So agriculture is a $9 billion industry in Salinas.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:26:41):**  80% of the leafy greens that we eat here in the US are grown in the Salinas Valley.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:26:48):**  So I was fascinated with the amount of agriculture there.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:26:52):**  I mean, I've come from New York.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:26:54):**  I'm basically a city girl.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:26:56):**  And I was like, wow, all these vegetables, who's growing them?  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:26:59):**  How are they being grown?  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:27:00):**  But what I did notice was there were not a lot of, visibly not a lot of women leaders  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:27:06):**  or women CEO level or entrepreneurs sort of in that space visibly.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:27:12):**  And I really wanted to uplift the voices, like new voices that I didn't really see in  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:27:16):**  either agriculture or technology.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:27:19):**  And I thought like the women were just amazing and that they're creating the innovations  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:27:23):**  for the growers to solve some of the biggest problems in agriculture.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:27:28):**  Do you see any particular challenges for women or people of color in Ag Tech as distinct  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:27:33):**  from in agriculture or in technology?  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:27:36):**  Like I think both Ag and Tech are traditionally male dominated industries, but what are you  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:27:40):**  seeing in Ag Tech specifically?  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:27:44):**  In the beginning, I saw, especially with the women that I talked to, they faced more challenges  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:27:49):**  because there were not a lot of women honestly in that space.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:27:53):**  And actually the space was pretty new.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:27:55):**  Ag Tech was really a fledgling sector back in 2014 and 15.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:28:00):**  But as it's become more and more known out there in the general public, there's been  
**[0:28:05-0:28:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:28:05):**  some high profile deals and investment in this area recently in the past year.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:28:11):**  And I think growers too increasingly wanting to have to try out the innovation and technology  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:28:16):**  to be more efficient and to save money and to make sure that they produce more.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:28:22):**  They've been seeking out innovations that work and it doesn't matter what color you  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:28:26):**  are or what age you are.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:28:28):**  I'm finding that they are just wanting something that really works.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:28:31):**  Is there anything that surprised you in your reporting and hearing these stories?  
**[0:28:38-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:28:38):**  What has surprised me, which shouldn't surprise me really, is the persistence of the women  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:28:43):**  in the space.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:28:44):**  I mean, now we're moving on to the fifth year where there were a handful of women that I  
**[0:28:49-0:28:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:28:49):**  talked to in the beginning.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:28:51):**  And it's incredibly challenging being an entrepreneur in the first place.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:28:55):**  It doesn't matter what industry you're in and it's very challenging raising your money  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:28:58):**  and hiring people and making sure you can pay yourself.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:29:02):**  So a lot of, I think the statistics are out there that a lot of small businesses and startup  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:29:07):**  businesses fail anyway.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:29:09):**  So I'm surprised that they're all still there actually and they're all doing rather well.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:29:17):**  I mean, during the pandemic and COVID, I think there's been a growing interest in their innovations  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:29:22):**  and technologies and they've been continuously raising money.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:29:26):**  So it's a really good surprise.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:29:29):**  After speaking to so many women wanting to break into ag and ag tech, this is Amy's advice.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:29:35):**  Don't give up easily, continue with it, network and really take advantage of the accelerator  
**[0:29:40-0:29:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:29:40):**  programs and the programs out there.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:29:42):**  I have some women who moved across the country from New York to California to be closer to  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:29:46):**  growers.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:29:47):**  So do what you need to do to keep pursuing your mission and your goal.

**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:29:58):**  as much as you can.

**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:30:05):**  and you see a woman that you're like, Oh wow, what she talked about is really interesting.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:30:09):**  Like follow up with her.

**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:30:15):**  In some ways they want to see more female founders.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:30:18):**  They want to have a place to connect with other female founders too.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:30:21):**  And she says, don't be afraid to keep telling your story right throughout your career.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:30:27):**  I think a lot had not really been covered in the media before.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:30:30):**  And this is why I kept saying, wow, you have a story to tell.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech#t=0:30:33):**  You have something to your voice to share.

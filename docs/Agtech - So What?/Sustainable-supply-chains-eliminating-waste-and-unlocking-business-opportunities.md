### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 02 Jun 2021 20:01:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  
**[0:00:05-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:00:05):**  I'm Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:00:07):**  The word sustainability is something we hear and talk a lot about in food and ag, but what  
**[0:00:13-0:00:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:00:13):**  does it actually mean?  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:00:14):**  And most important, how do we actually do it?  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:00:17):**  If you've tried, whether as a consumer trying to use less packaging, or as a farmer trying  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:00:22):**  to figure out what practices to change that will be good for the farm and for the world  
**[0:00:26-0:00:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:00:26):**  without going broke, you know just how hard it is.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:00:29):**  But there are also opportunities and startups and investors are seeing this.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:00:34):**  Today we speak to three industry leaders, each working at different points along the  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:00:38):**  supply chain to shake up how things are done.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:00:41):**  We dig into how technology and data can help build trust and resilience, why developing  
**[0:00:45-0:00:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:00:45):**  better metrics can unlock new business opportunities for farmers, and why eliminating packaging  
**[0:00:51-0:00:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:00:51):**  and food waste is so damn hard.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:00:53):**  So let's start at the beginning of the supply chain, the farm.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:00:57):**  I think the biggest challenge we've got in sustainable supply chains is metrics.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:01:02):**  That's Lachlan Monsborough.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:01:04):**  He's the head of sustainable business development at Rabobank, and he gets to work directly  
**[0:01:08-0:01:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:01:08):**  with farmers.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:01:09):**  How do we translate the actual footprint of all farmers into the consumer goods market  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:01:15):**  without basically the emotion that's attached in certification at the moment where people  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:01:19):**  are making choices, consumers are making choices based on perception of what good actually  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:01:25):**  is rather than what is actually measured.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:01:29):**  The issue of perception versus an actual evidence base remains a challenge all over food and  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:01:34):**  ag supply chains, with many brands making claims about sustainability that unfortunately  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:01:39):**  look a lot more like greenwashing.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:01:41):**  But I do think we're seeing a shift.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:01:44):**  Brands now want to be green, not just claim that they are.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:01:47):**  Lachlan says for Rabobank, this starts with knowing the environmental footprint of farms.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:01:52):**  At least for us, things that are happening in terms of the pressure that's on central  
**[0:01:57-0:02:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:01:57):**  banks to essentially equate financial service providers' footprints and disclose it openly,  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:02:04):**  that means we're forced to have essentially more transparent conversations with their  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:02:08):**  clients about what's actually going on on the farm.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:02:12):**  Not just from a P&L perspective, not just from a yield perspective, but what are the  
**[0:02:17-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:02:17):**  impacts that the productivity is causing and what are the practices that you're using to  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:02:24):**  start to mitigate them?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:02:25):**  And then on top of that, you've got the whole climate risk thing, which is basically, again,  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:02:31):**  the financial supervisors of the world, the central banks, the financial regulators are  
**[0:02:35-0:02:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:02:35):**  starting to ask, okay, well, what does transition look like at certain RCPs for your portfolio?  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:02:42):**  So what are the essentially the dead owners of the clients doing to reassure you as the  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:02:49):**  banker that with a 2-degree warming, a 3-degree warming, whatever it might be, that they're  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:02:55):**  not going to go belly up in the process of that transition.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:03:00):**  And that requires, all panellists have spoken about it, that requires metrics.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:03:05):**  To be able to quantify that and quantify that accurately, that requires metrics.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:03:09):**  So I think the whole, whilst there are some sectors of the industry that are still sort  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:03:14):**  of feeling their way on it, it's going to happen, right?  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:03:17):**  The European Sustainable Finance Tech Site, I mean, is sort of laid down.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:03:21):**  There's a whole range of things that are sort of forcing us as financiers to sort of start  
**[0:03:26-0:03:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:03:26):**  to work with our clients to quantify this stuff and also work with other service providers  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:03:33):**  to work out, okay, the farmer probably doesn't want 15 different people coming to them and  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:03:39):**  saying, oh, I need this data, I need that data, I need this data.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:03:42):**  How can we synergise it a bit better as well?  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:03:45):**  Yeah, it's really interesting.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:03:47):**  You talk about the risk side.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:03:49):**  Is that kind of what you're seeing?  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:03:50):**  A lot of these drivers are coming from a either regulatory or risk perception or is it coming  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:03:55):**  from like opportunities to make more money or where are you seeing the push or pull?  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:01):**  That's the balance that we're trying to work out ourselves because you can't just go to  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:05):**  your clients with a big stick, right?  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:07):**  They go to another bank.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:08):**  So what are the opportunities that are there?  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:11):**  All the top FMCG companies in the world have got these targets out to 2050 or 2040 or whatever  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:17):**  it is around their footprint, right?  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:19):**  Whether it be an emissions footprint, water footprint or whatever it is, which are metrics  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:23):**  based.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:24):**  So how can we create supply chain opportunities within that to basically meet the market that  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:29):**  has been signalled?  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:32):**  So risk, whether it's the actual environmental risk that farmers face in a changing climate  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:36):**  or the risk of increased regulation is a driver and expectations from both consumers and the  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:42):**  shareholders of big food and ag companies is another.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:46):**  And now banks and investors more broadly are seeing not just risks, but also financial  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:50):**  opportunities to be more sustainable.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:52):**  And this is where startups in particular come in.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:04:55):**  Jessica Vieira is the senior director of sustainability at Appeal Sciences.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:05:00):**  Appeal launched back in 2012 with a $100,000 grant from the Gates Foundation.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:05:05):**  We're a company based in California.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:05:08):**  Appeal Sciences, we've developed a plant derived coating that's applied to fresh fruits and  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:05:12):**  vegetables after they're harvested.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:05:14):**  This edible coating slows down water loss and oxidation such that the produce lasts  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:05:20):**  twice as long as it would have without the coating.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:05:23):**  Appeal has grown over the last 10 years and has raised nearly $400 million, backed by  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:05:28):**  big name ag and sovereign wealth funds and celebrities like Oprah and Katy Perry.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:05:33):**  But I think what we're also seeing in the last few years is this huge uptick in, I mean,  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:05:40):**  we're a venture capital based or supported company in venture capitalists looking for  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:05:45):**  opportunities focused in this space too.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:05:48):**  Food waste is a great example.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:05:50):**  It costs $2.6 trillion to our global economy.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:05:54):**  And it's this kind of invisible tax on our food system.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:05:57):**  It applies in almost every supply chain, every actor deals with it.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:06:02):**  And it's just something that is baked in.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:06:04):**  And we kind of view it as not necessarily just a tax, but like an untapped savings account  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:06:11):**  that if we can figure out ways to unlock that value, we can reinvest in the supply chain  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:06:17):**  in other ways too.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:06:19):**  And I think there has been this shift of really like, not just focusing on, you know, we need  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:06:24):**  to do less bad, but this is an opportunity for innovation that's worth investing in.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:06:30):**  We have a large partnership with the Kroger company who's a retailer here in the US.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:06:34):**  And even they have an innovation fund that this year is solely focused on investing in  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:06:39):**  companies upcycling materials.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:06:42):**  So I mean, you're kind of seeing it all across the board.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:06:45):**  And it's so different than when I started in this industry where we had to even rebrand  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:06:51):**  some of the programs I worked on to not call them green because of how that might not get  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:06:56):**  traction internally for certain things.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:06:58):**  And it's just like a total 180 now in terms of the support and resources going behind  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:07:05):**  these types of programs.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:07:07):**  One of the challenges with food waste in particular is that it's a physical product and so software-only  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:07:12):**  solutions just won't cut it.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:07:14):**  But hardware can be expensive and, well, harder to scale.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:07:19):**  Olympia Yager, however, is not afraid of a challenge.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:07:21):**  She's the founder of Go Terra, an Aussie waste management company that uses robots and maggots  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:07:26):**  to turn food waste into animal feed.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:07:28):**  For transparency, we are an investor in Go Terra via Tenacious Ventures.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:07:33):**  Here's Olympia.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:07:34):**  I'm based here in Ngunnawal country in Canberra.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:07:38):**  We build waste management infrastructure to deliver food waste management using insects.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:07:45):**  I come from a conventional agricultural background, mostly sheep and some cattle.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:07:50):**  I think for us the thing that's most important when we think about the supply chain and of  
**[0:07:55-0:08:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:07:55):**  course where we fit in in food waste is both the changes of socioeconomic focuses and then  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:08:02):**  the resiliency of sovereignty of the supply chain when it's linear as opposed to circular.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:08:07):**  And the need to move to a circular economy I think is recognised, but we've focused primarily  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:08:13):**  on digital solutions.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:08:15):**  And we are now sort of in a place where we're like, oh, we actually don't have the infrastructure  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:08:19):**  or hardware required to deliver those, like some of the most incredible digital solutions.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:08:24):**  We still need hardware and infrastructure to have them realised.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:08:29):**  And I think we sort of sit right there in that like socioeconomic changes are coming,  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:08:34):**  who's going to pay?  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:08:35):**  Because it's like if you're going to reuse things, then their first cost might be more  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:08:38):**  expensive, but then you've got to pay for them more times as you reuse or fix or repair.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:08:44):**  And then what's going to be needed to realise sustainable supply chains that create regional  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:08:49):**  sovereignty in relation to hardware and infrastructure?  
**[0:08:54-0:08:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:08:54):**  I think everyone's realising the opportunity.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:08:56):**  And I love the reframing food waste as a savings account instead of a tax, because most of  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:09:03):**  what I believe around, food waste is a symptom of broken supply chains and an incentivisation  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:09:10):**  towards production, right?  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:09:12):**  And so if we don't have places to put the stuff we're producing, it gets wasted.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:09:16):**  But if we are going to invest in upcycling and recycling, like those ideas are really  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:09:22):**  great, but what we end up finding is you create a way of doing things that then has no front  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:09:27):**  or back end to deliver or then push it the other way.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:09:31):**  And so like what I think what we're actually facing is a really big challenge.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:09:36):**  It's not undoable, but we have I think we do have to step into thinking and looking  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:09:40):**  at hardware, because most of the investments are not in hardware.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:09:43):**  They're in data driven, SaaS platform driven plays, which are important.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:09:48):**  The data is really important.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:09:50):**  But to deliver on these things, the vertical integration of hardware is going to have to  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:09:56):**  be realised.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:09:57):**  When we look at it from a food waste perspective, you've got types of food waste through the  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:10:02):**  supply chain, and some of them are easier to manage than others.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:10:06):**  Some of them don't even exist once you get good data.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:10:09):**  But then as you get further down into the waste streams that are actually waste, the  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:10:14):**  challenge of managing those in real time is actually very difficult and can't be solved  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:10:20):**  easily.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:10:21):**  So we do see like hundreds of millions of VC investment into food waste right now, but  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:10:26):**  it's all on front end.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:10:28):**  So it's all pre-consumer from farm gate, manufacturing, brewing stuff.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:10:32):**  So very easy to manage uniform waste streams that happen in large volumes, but not the  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:10:37):**  stuff that actually costs us money that happens, the 60% of food waste that happens on the  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:10:42):**  far end of the supply chain.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:10:45):**  I think we're running into a sort of sticking point where data is going to be there explaining  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:10:49):**  what we need, but we will not have hardware to deliver on that need.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:10:53):**  Yeah, it's so hard to understand.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:10:56):**  What goes on in a consumer's home is such a black box, even though we know, at least  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:00):**  in high income markets, that's where a majority of the waste happens.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:05):**  There is this cool technology.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:08):**  They're more looking at it at the restaurant level.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:10):**  Winnow is the name of the company where they have this AI solution that looks over your  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:15):**  trashcan and it identifies and it's basically on top of a scale too.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:21):**  So it actually, as things are going into the trashcan, it's identifying what it is and  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:26):**  how much is going in.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:28):**  So restaurants at least can actually have some information to learn how to better manage  
**[0:11:34-0:11:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:34):**  inventory.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:36):**  Then it's like, we still have to either decide we're going to try to change behavior.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:39):**  We can know what's going in there, but that's different than getting people to change.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:44):**  Who actually pays for this?  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:45):**  Is it the restaurants that pay for the different infrastructure to get people to put stuff  
**[0:11:49-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:49):**  in different bins?  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:50):**  Is it the food brands that pay?  
**[0:11:52-0:11:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:52):**  Is it the corporates that pay?  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:53):**  Is it the waste management companies that pay?  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:55):**  I don't know.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:56):**  Olympia, what's your view on these kind of sustainability requirements?  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:11:59):**  Who actually pays to make this happen?  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:12:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:12:03):**  So it's interesting because now, as we start to move to more sustainable things, you see  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:12:08):**  people that wouldn't have paid previously paying now.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:12:11):**  So you're seeing lots of technology that's bringing more of the supply chain in past  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:12:16):**  the farm gate, provenir, all those sorts of things that are saying, like farmers want  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:12:20):**  to own the farm gate, the story past their farm gate a little bit more, and they wouldn't  
**[0:12:24-0:12:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:12:24):**  have paid for that historically.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:12:26):**  It was sufficient to make the farm gate part of their story, and then that was enough.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:12:32):**  And now it's like, no, I want more of the supply chain to be stuck inside my farm gate.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:12:36):**  And then the second part, what we see and what I think is really interesting from any  
**[0:12:40-0:12:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:12:40):**  startups out there or how we think about this moving forward is this perspective of the  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:12:47):**  technology.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:12:48):**  So if you say to a restaurateur, you should pay more for wasting food, not necessarily  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:12:56):**  a terribly great pitch, but that's kind of what's happening right now, which is like,  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:13:00):**  we have a great technology, it's new, it does all these wonderful things.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:13:03):**  You'll have to pay more than the current system you're using to solve this problem.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:13:08):**  And they're like, I don't see that value.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:13:09):**  But if you, like Winnow, the point of Winnow is to explain to chefs and the restaurant  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:13:16):**  managers where they're wasting food and where they actually have food waste.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:13:22):**  So the two things are very different.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:13:23):**  And so if you can actually get an account of what you're buying and then throwing away,  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:13:28):**  you will make better decisions.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:13:30):**  And so it's that story that has to be done a little bit better by founders, I think,  
**[0:13:35-0:13:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:13:35):**  when we go to bat in the market.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:13:37):**  Because yes, you are going to pay, it's going to be more, but the change and the shift that  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:13:41):**  comes from that data means you don't pay at the other end where you used to pay.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:13:46):**  So you're just sort of moving the payment up and down, I guess, the supply chain.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:13:50):**  But that's where I think the socioeconomic stuff is super interesting to me because education  
**[0:13:54-0:14:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:13:54):**  is going to be the core part of new adoption and how we reimagine what we've done.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:14:02):**  We've always done it this way and now I have to reimagine why I'm doing things to bring  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:14:06):**  in new data to make better decisions, to still get the same outcome, but just in a different  
**[0:14:10-0:14:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:14:10):**  format.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:14:11):**  Are you, Lachlan, I'm curious if you're kind of having the same conversation around education.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:14:17):**  Do you see that as a big part of what needs to happen here is changing the conversation  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:14:21):**  and building more awareness around what is waste, what is sustainable, that kind of thing?  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:14:26):**  Oh, completely.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:14:27):**  Because essentially the commodity chain in terms of the value proposition has been the  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:14:33):**  premium, for want of a better word, is often bastardized.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:14:38):**  So what the farmer gets and what the trade along the way makes from it is something completely  
**[0:14:44-0:14:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:14:44):**  different.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:14:45):**  So that's being valorized in different ways, which probably takes away from that initial  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:14:50):**  hey, why is the farmer doing this in the first place to tell a better story about the food  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:14:54):**  that they're producing?  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:14:55):**  And that's being used for marketing purposes, which doesn't always get the result of what  
**[0:15:00-0:15:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:15:00):**  was intended.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:15:02):**  So that's one thing.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:15:04):**  But I know I sound like a broken record here, but this is the whole point about moving to  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:15:10):**  metrics where you're actually talking about a CO2 footprint or a water footprint or whatever,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:15:17):**  rather than another brand in that space, right, rather than a certification brand in that  
**[0:15:22-0:15:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:15:22):**  space.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:15:23):**  Because if we are able to essentially take away that sort of perception of what something  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:15:30):**  might entail or might not entail based on a brand that sits on a product, a certification  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:15:36):**  that sits on a product and turn it into a metric, that will educate people in themselves.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:15:41):**  I mean, they'll be making the decision, the purchasing decision for something that's quantified  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:15:47):**  rather than a perception.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:15:50):**  I guess the counterpoint to that, like, one of the challenges with that is we already  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:15:53):**  see, especially at the consumer level and increasingly at the farmer level, this absolute  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:15:57):**  explosion of different metrics.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:15:59):**  And so farmers are being asked now to report on 1700 things and the metrics platforms might  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:03):**  be there, but which ones do they report on and to who?  
**[0:16:05-0:16:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:05):**  And then like, there's just too many things out there and it's organic and now it's carbon.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:08):**  And so the counterpoint to that maybe would be around metrics overload.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:12):**  And how do you get back to enabling decision making both at the farm level and at the consumer  
**[0:16:17-0:16:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:17):**  level?  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:18):**  Jess, what do you think about the metrics conversation?  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:20):**  I mean, I agree with you.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:22):**  This was attempted in Europe several years ago with the environmental product declarations.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:28):**  They kind of walked that back.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:30):**  They're revisiting it again.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:31):**  I think it's really hard to develop guidelines that apply across entire sections of the grocery  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:38):**  store.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:39):**  For example, you can use QR codes.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:41):**  There's ways that you could link this information to consumers.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:45):**  A colleague of mine who used to work at a retailer said they did this whole program.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:49):**  They had a QR codes related to sustainable seafood.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:53):**  No one really looked at the QR codes, but when they surveyed people, people were more  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:16:57):**  likely to buy it because they knew the information was there.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:17:01):**  And so they felt like it was probably a more sustainable option.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:17:04):**  And I thought that was just such an interesting because like, I don't even read it.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:17:08):**  I know if I'm being honest, like I don't read every label of everything that I buy in the  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:17:12):**  grocery store either.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:17:14):**  So how could I expect someone who probably is less informed about sustainability to do  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:17:19):**  so?  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:17:20):**  So I do think that some people are talking about maybe gamification will get it to work.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:17:25):**  I don't know how many parts of our life we really can gamify at once.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:17:29):**  I'd like to think we need to make it really easy for consumers.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:17:33):**  We need to give them a better option without them needing to make a million more decisions  
**[0:17:39-0:17:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:17:39):**  in the grocery store.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:17:41):**  I don't think there's a great solution yet though for how we communicate all of that  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:17:46):**  information.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:17:47):**  I think that's the whole point though.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:17:50):**  Whilst we're still in where the majority of our, let's call them sub brands behind products,  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:17:56):**  about perception rather than metrics.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:18:00):**  That's a dangerous place to be in because you don't actually get the impact.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:18:04):**  So long as we can get those, call them sub brands, underneath the consumer goods, the  
**[0:18:10-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:18:10):**  brands of the actual consumer good to be metrics based and to be understood to be metrics based.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:18:19):**  Then I think the confidence that was just talked about can actually be delivered.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:18:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:18:25):**  I think you're right.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:18:26):**  It's not necessarily consumers who need to see the data.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:18:28):**  It's like those credible, the skeptical groups that would dig in and kind of undercut your  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:18:35):**  brand reputation.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:18:36):**  If you incentivize them, then you're building the right amount of trust perhaps.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:18:41):**  Don't we think the challenge around the metrics is that we're not really sure what this is  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:18:47):**  yet?  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:18:48):**  Like an organic product, for example, the metrics are pretty, we understand what the  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:18:54):**  metrics are required to consider yourself organic.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:18:57):**  But for sustainability, it's so broad right now.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:19:00):**  Like what is sustainable is such a broad thing that I think that's why we're seeing this  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:19:06):**  sort of confusing pile on of metrics where we're like, it's got to be SDG driven, it's  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:19:12):**  going to be carbon emission sequestration driven, it's got to be this, it's going to  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:19:15):**  be that.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:19:16):**  And then you must overlay that with emotional stuff.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:19:19):**  So grass fed, all these other components of the impression of what sustainability means,  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:19:27):**  which is both driven by economics, but also by social and cultural values.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:19:32):**  And so I sort of think about it from some of our waste clients.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:19:35):**  So we have, you look at fast food, just going to precursor this statement by saying, have  
**[0:19:41-0:19:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:19:41):**  lots of other issues in sustainability and waste, but in the waste of actual food, fast  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:19:50):**  food restaurants do not waste.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:19:53):**  McDonald's has figured out how to build a handle that is exactly the size that means  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:19:59):**  that people do not eat only a third of a quarter pounder.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:20:04):**  They eat the entire quarter pounder, they eat the entire box of chips.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:20:08):**  And so a McDonald's restaurant might waste less than 20 kilos of actual food a week.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:20:15):**  That is insane for how much volume goes through a McDonald's restaurant.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:20:20):**  Fast fresh restaurants, which we all align with being very clean and good for us, waste  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:20:27):**  far more than that because they're trying to cater to you walking up and going, I don't  
**[0:20:32-0:20:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:20:32):**  want that part of that.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:20:33):**  And I'd like you to add this to that.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:20:35):**  And then I kind of want more of that.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:20:37):**  And then I want it all fresh.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:20:38):**  And so they have to do a different thing.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:20:41):**  And so I think the metrics will start to align once we actually understand where we want  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:20:45):**  our businesses to be.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:20:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:20:48):**  And I think that's a really good point.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:20:49):**  So we've done a bit of research in the bank looking at sort of the top 50 FMCG companies  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:20:55):**  around the world and understanding in their public commitments what their hot topics are.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:21:02):**  And they're carbon biodiversity, soil health, waste, emerging markets, the whole social  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:21:09):**  element, modern slavery, whether it be labour rights, all that sort of stuff.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:21:14):**  So I mean, this isn't peer reviewed perfect research, right?  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:21:19):**  But this is so that we could have a conversation with our clients that, hey, whilst we've got  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:21:25):**  a regulatory element to it, the people that buy your commodities have stated this is what  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:21:31):**  they need to deliver to investors and consumers as well.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:21:34):**  Right.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:21:35):**  So we see those sort of five topics as relatively synonymous that farmers have to consider that  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:21:41):**  essentially that the top of the supply chain has to start to quantify and has to start  
**[0:21:47-0:21:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:21:47):**  to certify over the next 20 years to meet essentially 80 to 90% of the global agri supply  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:21:54):**  chain.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:21:55):**  Unfortunately, we don't really have time to wait for metric systems to align.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:21:59):**  We need ways to take action today to make supply chains more sustainable.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:22:03):**  Here's Jess.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:22:05):**  One area that's relatively small that we see in produce because of its perishability is  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:22:11):**  their entire supply chains that rely on air freight today to move around the world.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:22:16):**  I mean, that's not an inefficiency.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:22:19):**  Like, I'm not sure what is.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:22:21):**  So I mean, that I see as a massive opportunity.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:22:24):**  The amount of plastic packaging that's used and plastic packaging is really tough because  
**[0:22:29-0:22:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:22:29):**  one, if it's preventing enough food waste, some of the environmental costs can be justified.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:22:36):**  Two, plastic packaging oftentimes is serving so many different functions for the food.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:22:42):**  So it might be for grouping as well as protection as well as shelf life extension.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:22:48):**  And there's tons of real estate for marketing for all of those different claims you want  
**[0:22:52-0:22:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:22:52):**  to make that we just talked about.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:22:54):**  And so it's hard to find to create solutions that can actually address all of those functions  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:23:00):**  that would be needed to truly replace or eliminate it.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:23:04):**  For appeal, we have one product that we've launched here in the US for long English cucumbers  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:23:09):**  because they're just wrapped in single use plastic, just shrink wrapped.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:23:15):**  And the only thing that shrink wrap is doing really is shelf life extension.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:23:19):**  So we've actually been able to eliminate that with the use of our product.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:23:23):**  But admittedly, there are very few examples where it's that straightforward because the  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:23:28):**  plastic packaging is usually doing so many different things.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:23:32):**  So that's obviously another big area.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:23:35):**  And then the last area that we're thinking about is the cold chain and the use of refrigerants  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:23:42):**  are a big environmental hotspot.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:23:45):**  And are there opportunities for us?  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:23:47):**  There's a lot of technologies to kind of get smarter and optimize our use of the cold chain,  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:23:51):**  but in places where we haven't implemented it yet, where we know in the next 10 years  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:23:57):**  we are going to be, can we think about leapfrogging that with less intensive ways to store and  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:02):**  distribute food?  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:04):**  So that way we don't need to develop those kind of emissions intensive infrastructure  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:10):**  systems in the first place.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:12):**  So I mean, that's probably that's a big area that not one technology is going to solve  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:17):**  on its own, but something that could be exciting to look at.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:20):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:21):**  Your point about packaging that, Olympia, can you share, you see the other end of this  
**[0:24:24-0:24:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:24):**  with what Go Terra does.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:25):**  Like you see what comes out the other side of this waste conversation.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:29):**  What do you see are the challenges and opportunities there?  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:32):**  So the challenge is that people don't care and we don't actually realize or have a strong  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:37):**  understanding of how much packaging we use at all, like period.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:43):**  But if you think about, if you tried to sit down and think about every time you took a  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:46):**  piece of plastic off something that was related to food, it gets a little horrifying.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:52):**  It's Friday today, which means it's waste day where we've already received six tons  
**[0:24:57-0:24:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:57):**  of waste.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:24:58):**  40% of that waste will be packaging.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:25:02):**  And so that's an incredible amount of soft plastics that have nowhere to go.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:25:06):**  And it's all relative to food down to the just stupid little things.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:25:11):**  It's like, why is this chocolate inside the box, inside the plastic also now inside plastic?  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:25:18):**  So I keep coming back again to the socioeconomic part, because even when we see it in restaurants,  
**[0:25:24-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:25:24):**  the challenge with restaurants, our unit up in Sydney, we've got really great source separating  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:25:31):**  at the back of house for the restaurants.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:25:33):**  But humans, we are fallible and we also are, when we're in a rush, our care factor diminishes  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:25:40):**  exponentially.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:25:42):**  And so you look at back of house operations in busy restaurants and people who are paid  
**[0:25:49-0:25:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:25:49):**  not high wages, their concern about whether or not a Chuck swipe or packaging goes into  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:25:56):**  organics waste, it just doesn't exist.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:26:00):**  And that's okay, because I think the job of that is actually not on the client.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:26:06):**  I think that's now on the waste management provider or how we manage waste.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:26:10):**  And it's the same at the farm gate level.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:26:13):**  So if the farmer can find better ways to package produce to go to market, that's an innovation  
**[0:26:20-0:26:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:26:20):**  that delivers an outcome, right?  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:26:22):**  So reusable or sustainable or compostable, however we want to look at it, but it's then  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:26:28):**  the manufacturers or whoever receives those goods job to find better ways of handling  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:26:33):**  that packaging and places for it to go.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:26:35):**  I don't like this assignment of blame for whoever touched it last.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:26:39):**  It feels like we're all in a circle going back, you touch it.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:26:43):**  And then whoever's get left holding it at the end is the person that pays.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:26:47):**  And I feel like instead we have to go, okay, we can make these efficiencies on my end.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:26:51):**  And when I punt it down the chain to the next person, they're going to find ways to deal  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:26:56):**  with it in their way.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:26:58):**  I remember on a flight from Jakarta to Lamphong, which is about 20 minutes, the trade at the  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:27:06):**  airline, and I probably can't name the airline, served with, I don't know, a bit of cake or  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:27:11):**  something.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:27:12):**  I remember counting, they had 17 bits of plastic.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:27:15):**  So if you do the maths on that in terms of, okay, there's 200 people on each plane that  
**[0:27:20-0:27:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:27:20):**  are flying, they're flying eight times a day, it's just horrific.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:27:27):**  And you're sort of like, oh no, I can't eat it.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:27:30):**  But at the end of the day, it's only going to be pressure on that actual supply chain  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:27:35):**  before that's going to make any difference whatsoever.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:27:39):**  Once it goes into that cart on that plane, it's going to be in one way or the other.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:27:44):**  Whether you don't want it or you ate half of it, that plastic is going to landfill.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:27:49):**  And I think there is this sort of social adoption pace where like my short shower won't save  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:27:56):**  Australia in a drought, but me explaining to everybody that plastic is bad and that  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:02):**  I'd prefer stuff not to be in plastic does create momentum around change.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:07):**  And so, but I think it's going to be more around innovations like appeal, where we can  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:13):**  get, just start getting rid of some of this plastic out of our supply chains.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:18):**  And that's a great thing for farmers, right?  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:20):**  Because if we could add these things, I don't know where we put appeal in, in the supply  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:24):**  chain.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:25):**  But if we can start doing some of these things at farm gate, then it's kind of out of the  
**[0:28:30-0:28:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:30):**  rest of the supply chain, right?  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:31):**  Because if it's been done at farm gate or very close to, why am I adding anything else,  
**[0:28:37-0:28:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:37):**  right?  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:38):**  So, yeah, it just becomes a cost for the FMCG for no benefit.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:42):**  So they won't do it.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:43):**  No, they'll be like, oh, it's already sorted.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:45):**  I'm not going to add to that.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:46):**  So yeah, I think there's some interesting parts there as we keep moving forward.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:52):**  So that's exactly where we do it at the Produce Packing House that's co-located with where  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:56):**  it's grown.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:57):**  So yeah, I mean, it makes it easier for that.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:28:59):**  It's kind of one let.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:00):**  We swap out the plastic, swap in our application systems.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:03):**  That kind of ties back to some of the points we were making before around then requirements  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:08):**  on farmers.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:09):**  Like, so if we want to move it up the supply chain, you kind of get further away from who  
**[0:29:13-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:13):**  might pay for it.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:14):**  And so in New Zealand, they've just introduced mandatory farm environmental plans.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:18):**  And the conversation has been around nitrate leaching and around some of the social license  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:22):**  concerns and we need to clean up our waterways.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:25):**  And so that's led to mandatory reporting.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:27):**  There's also a parallel conversation around having a plan and thinking about how you'll  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:31):**  improve can drive better business outcomes and actually leads to profitability.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:35):**  So probably jury's still out, but my sense is there's been a largely positive reaction  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:40):**  to having these plans, but it's kind of a slippery slope to imposing requirements on  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:44):**  farmers without thinking about the incentives they might get.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:46):**  Bloch, you're nodding any comments on that?  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:49):**  Yeah, well, this is what we've got a large portfolio in New Zealand and this is what  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:53):**  we're struggling with because you think, I don't know what percentage of it New Zealand  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:29:58):**  dairy produce goes to skim milk powder in East and Southeast Asia, but it'd be significant,  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:30:04):**  significant whack.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:30:07):**  How do you quantify to the average East Asian consumer who's fairly price conscious?  
**[0:30:13-0:30:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:30:13):**  How do you quantify that you should pay $0.20 extra kilo to look after New Zealand's waterways,  
**[0:30:20-0:30:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:30:20):**  which they would consider probably pretty clean anyway, right?  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:30:23):**  So these are sort of the, I guess the wicked problems that we've got across commodity chains,  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:30:28):**  but if farmers actually have control of that premium and that premium is not bastardized  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:30:33):**  through the supply chain, like it's actually a ticket to the product for the FMCG company  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:30:39):**  and it's not something that's sort of corrupted and perverted across the supply chain as every  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:30:44):**  different person tries to assign value to it or create more value out of it.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:30:49):**  I think there might be solutions there because essentially, one, the consumer knows, all  
**[0:30:55-0:31:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:30:55):**  right, there is transparency, it's uncorrupted, I'm paying for what I'm hoping to pay for  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:31:02):**  and two, it's almost separated from the commodity, right?  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:31:05):**  The commodity is still skim milk powder, but there are these additional co-benefits that  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:31:10):**  are a relatively direct transaction.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:31:13):**  We feel like though that it's sooner or later, and this is a really, I'm going to wade right  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:31:18):**  into something a bit dangerous here, it suggests that sooner or later we're just going to have  
**[0:31:22-0:31:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:31:22):**  to pay for things to be done better?  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:31:25):**  I do.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:31:27):**  It's not a, the problem is that it's such a long-term piece.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:31:32):**  Like you'll usually, yes, you might get restrictions on your input usage or things like that as  
**[0:31:37-0:31:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:31:37):**  a farmer and that, and because it's regulatory, it's far sharper than the rate of increase  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:31:44):**  in the technological curve, right?  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:31:47):**  So you're, and working out the systems, working out the finance systems or whatever it is  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:31:53):**  that sort of says, okay, well, you're going to have to take the hit now because of regulatory  
**[0:31:56-0:32:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:31:56):**  purposes, but probably technology on yield is growing at 3% or 4% compound over 20 years.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:32:04):**  So you'll probably get back to that similar yield sometime in the future.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:32:09):**  It's bridging that gap and sort of keeping people in the game and relatively positive  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:32:14):**  and not feeling like they're being whacked for society's ills is the bloody tricky bit.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:32:20):**  So that gap then, yeah, because then that gap then is now on the producer in time.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:32:26):**  And so like, is that a policy driven thing?  
**[0:32:28-0:32:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:32:28):**  Like, is this going to come from corporates?  
**[0:32:31-0:32:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:32:31):**  Where does this, where does that, where does the gap come from?  
**[0:32:35-0:32:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:32:35):**  We promised each other we wouldn't talk about politics before the, I'm just asking where  
**[0:32:42-0:32:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:32:42):**  the driver comes from.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:32:44):**  Look, New Zealand, New Zealand and certain parts of Europe have taken a really interesting  
**[0:32:49-0:32:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:32:49):**  course, right?  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:32:50):**  In terms of really sort of regulating the way from a top down level, the way farmers  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:32:56):**  do things and the way farmers can actually farm, right?  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:33:00):**  Where apart from sort of sugar farmers along the reef in Australia, we haven't got there  
**[0:33:05-0:33:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:33:05):**  yet.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:33:06):**  The US certainly hasn't got there yet.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:33:07):**  Latin America hasn't.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:33:08):**  There are parts of Asia in environmental sensitive zones that have, but generally it's something  
**[0:33:15-0:33:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:33:15):**  that we're still absolutely feeling a way in, in terms of is it our, is it a societal  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:33:21):**  right almost to be able to dictate how our food is produced?  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:33:26):**  Why aren't we trusting farmers?  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:33:27):**  So yeah, look, New Zealand's certainly a long way down the road in that.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:33:33):**  And with, I don't know, let's call it mixed results at this stage.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:33:39):**  I'm curious, Locke, your perspective in Olympia too, if you have one on like the role of retailers,  
**[0:33:46-0:33:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:33:46):**  like we see these, you know, buyers and these retail organizations who have so much control  
**[0:33:53-0:34:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:33:53):**  over what, what the incentives are for suppliers to provide, what consumers have access to.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:34:01):**  They're basically curators of like the food we eat, the products that we can purchase,  
**[0:34:06-0:34:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:34:06):**  et cetera.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:34:07):**  And yet they're not always part of the conversation around, nor are they often incentivized to  
**[0:34:13-0:34:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:34:13):**  prioritize sustainability.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:34:16):**  So it's something that I am curious if there's anything you're aware of that's like been  
**[0:34:21-0:34:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:34:21):**  focused on that or, or your, if you've had any experience with that.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:34:25):**  I think, I think, I think that's our perception, Jess, right.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:34:31):**  But still at the heart of every supermarket, even if they're a multinational supermarket,  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:34:38):**  there's another 2 or 3 other supermarkets they're competing against.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:34:42):**  And their whole business model is based on having the food available for the consumer,  
**[0:34:48-0:34:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:34:48):**  whatever they want.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:34:49):**  There's never any an empty shelf.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:34:51):**  And they are so fearful of that, right.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:34:54):**  In terms of, all right, if we ramp up our compliance, our environmental compliance in  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:35:00):**  terms of what we want, is another supermarket suddenly going to be able to supply the same  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:35:05):**  product for 50% cheaper and have a much more secure supply chain because they're not excluding  
**[0:35:11-0:35:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:35:11):**  anybody from the market.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:35:12):**  So whilst that sounds like I'm rooting for these supermarkets here, that is still an  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:35:18):**  absolute problem that they face in fresh produce.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:35:22):**  And so we see with the sort of the implementation of the Modern Slavery Act as federal legislation  
**[0:35:27-0:35:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:35:27):**  in Australia over the last 2 years, that and sort of how that impacts on the fresh produce  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:35:34):**  chain, sort of supermarkets have been like, oh, gee, does this mean I actually have to  
**[0:35:39-0:35:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:35:39):**  say no to a supplier, right.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:35:42):**  Whilst it seems like, yeah, from sort of an outside perspective, they may be able to just  
**[0:35:47-0:35:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:35:47):**  click their fingers and say, hey, we need X, Y and Z.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:35:50):**  And I think you see that a little bit, especially around animal welfare, right.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:35:54):**  They have actually sort of said, hey, we can't have these risks in our supply chain.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:35:59):**  We will actually say no, we'll start to exclude you if you don't get RSPCA certification or  
**[0:36:05-0:36:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:36:05):**  whatever it is in certain animal proteins.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:36:07):**  They're still in a brutally competitive environment.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:36:11):**  It comes back to the analogy of fast food versus fast fresh and knowing who you are,  
**[0:36:16-0:36:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:36:16):**  right.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:36:17):**  We know from our clients that we have supermarket chains who are using the data from their waste  
**[0:36:25-0:36:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:36:25):**  management services with us to reduce their amount of waste.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:36:28):**  It is a self-fulfilling prophecy in supermarkets, particularly and retail of any food where  
**[0:36:38-0:36:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:36:38):**  the client's perception of what good food and fresh food is, so full shelves, is driving  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:36:45):**  decisions by supermarkets.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:36:46):**  And they don't cut things and put them in glad wrap because nobody wants them that way,  
**[0:36:52-0:36:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:36:52):**  right.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:36:53):**  Their data on what we're going to buy and how we're going to buy it and what size things  
**[0:36:57-0:37:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:36:57):**  we buy is so tight.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:37:00):**  But the second part of that is if you are a brand that has courage in changing to those  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:37:07):**  things and so like one of our clients has that, has made a commitment, a commercial  
**[0:37:12-0:37:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:37:12):**  commitment to change, you can leverage that courage to change your clients.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:37:19):**  But I think that same premise can be used in retail where it's like we're going to do  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:37:23):**  better for the climate and that means that as clients, if you come here, these are the  
**[0:37:28-0:37:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:37:28):**  changes you're going to have to experience.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:37:31):**  No plastic bags without being charged, you know, and those sorts of things.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:37:35):**  And we do see that in our clients once they have data and we made it all the way back  
**[0:37:40-0:37:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:37:40):**  to data.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:37:41):**  So like as soon as they got data that explained just how much of their waste was food and  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:37:48):**  how much of it was coming through, then they could start to make definitive decisions to  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:37:53):**  their logistics and supply chains to either remove some of that or diminish it.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:37:59):**  And money is the reason in the end, right, that saves them money, but it also drives  
**[0:38:05-0:38:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:38:05):**  goodwill which creates more money.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/sustainable-supply-chains-waste#t=0:38:12):**  And that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.

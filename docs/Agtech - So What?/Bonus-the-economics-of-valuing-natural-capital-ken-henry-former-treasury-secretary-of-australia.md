**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:00:14):**  Yeah, well, we'll see about that.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:00:17):**  Well, the reason I'm doing this is because there are few people who could better drill

**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:00:29):**  Well, look, I'm sure Ken easily qualifies to hold that mantle, but I'll do my best to  
**[0:00:34-0:00:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:00:34):**  catch up.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:00:35):**  Many Australians will know who Ken Henry is.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:00:37):**  He's a very well respected economist and former Treasury Secretary from 2001 to 2011, where  
**[0:00:44-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:00:44):**  he became known for his bold economic proposals.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:00:47):**  And in this episode, Ken is as bold as ever in his predictions for agriculture.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:00:52):**  I think the next year or so could see an absolute explosion in the development of financial  
**[0:00:58-0:01:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:00:58):**  instruments that reward farmers for soil carbon, for other forms of terrestrial carbon, also  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:05):**  for enhancement of environmental conditions.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:07):**  Matthew, before we listen to your chat with Ken, I think for our non Aussie listeners,  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:12):**  like myself, kind of, can you give us a bit of background?  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:16):**  Because surely it's rare for an economist to become almost a household name.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:20):**  Yeah, well, if there is such a thing, you know, Ken Henry might actually be Australia's  
**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:23):**  most famous economist.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:26):**  He's held a lot of pretty influential roles across government and the private sector,  
**[0:01:30-0:01:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:30):**  actually.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:31):**  So he was Secretary of the Treasury of Australia for a significant period during the 2000s.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:36):**  And he was also on the board of the Australian Federal Reserve Bank.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:39):**  So you know, a lot of pretty deep policy there.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:41):**  And it's actually probably that role that many Australians might remember him for, because  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:45):**  he was instrumental in Australia's response to the GFC, which actually included direct  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:50):**  stimulus payments to households.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:52):**  And there's nothing like a bit of free money to leave an impression, I guess.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:57):**  Interestingly, also, he was the chair of the board of the National Australia Bank, which  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:03):**  is one of Australia's four big banks, and actually Australia's largest agricultural  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:07):**  lender.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:08):**  And so has through that association also has had a pretty deep connection to ag for a long  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:13):**  period of time.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:14):**  But probably more than anything, Ken's known as a reformer.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:18):**  He's held key roles in the development of Australian fundamental reforms to Australian  
**[0:02:22-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:22):**  taxation policy, and also was instrumental in the formation of Australia's, let's say,  
**[0:02:29-0:02:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:29):**  notorious emissions trading scheme.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:31):**  And this is way back in 2004, when, you know, for many, many people, there was yet to be  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:36):**  any real recognition of the need for climate action.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:39):**  And the ETS was a very significant, albeit failed federal policy to try and develop a  
**[0:02:46-0:02:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:46):**  trading scheme for emissions.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:48):**  And so, you know, despite the fact that that actually wasn't successfully put into policy,  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:54):**  it does show that Ken has been thinking about this stuff for a very long time.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:57):**  Yeah, wow.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:58):**  Perhaps even longer than you, Matthew.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:00):**  Possibly.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:01):**  Yeah, possibly.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:02):**  But no, Ken's really been thinking about some of these higher level economic systems questions  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:07):**  when it comes to value in carbon and natural capital and what role that will play in agriculture  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:12):**  for a while.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:13):**  Yeah, look a little bit less in the public eye, perhaps today.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:16):**  But but no less involved in kind of driving important climate action response, and in  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:21):**  particular with a kind of economic and sustainability lens.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:24):**  More recently, as the member of the board of a group called Accounting for Nature, Ken  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:29):**  has actually helped to usher in the development of a set of standards specifically for valuing  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:34):**  natural capital.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:36):**  And as you'll hear in this episode, you know, his driving passion for recognition of natural  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:40):**  capital as part of an overall economic lens actually stems from his early childhood where  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:46):**  he was keenly interested in the natural environment.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:49):**  So perhaps we'll let Ken pick up the story from here.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:52):**  My interest in conservation as a young person, I think developed because of my father's occupation,  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:58):**  really.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:59):**  He was a timber worker.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:01):**  Well, he was a timber worker when he left school.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:05):**  And he left school very early.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:07):**  I think he did the first year of high school, perhaps twice.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:11):**  And he left school, became a timber worker.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:15):**  And then after marrying, he and my mother tried their luck on a dairy farm, which went  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:23):**  broke in a drought.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:27):**  And my father then went back to timber working and for the rest of his life, that's what  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:31):**  he was doing.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:32):**  So I became a logger, mainly in state forests in the mid-north coast of New South Wales.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:39):**  I, as a young fellow, was very aware of the work that he was doing and the way that he  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:44):**  felt about the work that he was doing.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:46):**  And in particular, became very aware of the waste that was involved in the work that he  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:53):**  was doing, the carnage that was inflicted on the state forests of New South Wales because  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:58):**  of practices that were condemned by the state government at the time.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:04):**  Absolutely inexplicable practices.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:06):**  I remember one afternoon, he came home from work relatively early and he was in a great  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:12):**  state of excitement.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:14):**  And he said, boys, there were three of us.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:16):**  My mother had three sons in less than three years.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:19):**  He said, boys, jump in the back of the car.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:22):**  I want to show you something.

**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:30):**  We'd never seen anything like it.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:32):**  I've never seen anything like it since.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:35):**  The diameter of the log, even at the thinner end, would have been perhaps 1.8 metres.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:43):**  At the thicker end, it was well over two metres.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:46):**  And there was only one log on the truck.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:49):**  This was a huge logging truck.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:50):**  That was the log.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:52):**  And he had chopped it down that day.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:54):**  And so I got into a discussion with him.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:57):**  I was still in primary school.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:58):**  I got into a discussion with him about the history of this log.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:03):**  Of course, it started with the tree.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:04):**  Like how big was the tree?  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:06):**  How old was the tree?  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:07):**  I remember him saying the tree was obviously several hundred years old.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:12):**  And he told me which state forest it would come out of.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:16):**  I asked him questions like how much would the log be worth?  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:22):**  He didn't put a monetary figure on it, but I do remember him saying, well, you'd certainly  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:26):**  get the framing for three or four timber houses out of this one log.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:30):**  So clearly it was worth a bit.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:32):**  I asked him how much he would have been paid for cutting the log down.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:38):**  Of course, he was on the lowest award wage in the Australian Industrial Relations System,  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:44):**  so he didn't get paid very much for that day's work or whatever it was that was involved  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:48):**  in cutting the log down.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:50):**  And I said, well, what, the timber mill gets the rest?  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:54):**  He said, no, no, no, no, no.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:56):**  There are also royalties payable on this log.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:58):**  And I asked him what royalties were, and he told me what royalties were.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:01):**  And I said, well, how much?  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:03):**  So that's a return to the people of New South Wales for you having taken this log out of  
**[0:07:09-0:07:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:09):**  the state forest.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:10):**  And he said, yeah, that's what it is, I guess.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:12):**  And I said, well, how much would the royalties be?  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:14):**  And he told me it was a few dollars.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:17):**  And then, you know, and I was a bit troubled by that.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:19):**  And he said, well, he said, you know, perhaps you need to understand, he said, look, this  
**[0:07:25-0:07:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:25):**  is a grey gum.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:27):**  Most grey gums of this age or anything like this age have a huge hollow core in them.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:32):**  So when you top down a grey gum, you expect that it's not going to be worth anything to  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:37):**  the mill.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:38):**  Because the mill won't take the grey gum.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:40):**  It's not worth their while, unless there's at least one foot of solid timber around the  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:46):**  core in the middle of the tree.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:49):**  So most grey gums, when I cut them down, there's not that much timber around the core.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:54):**  I said, well, what happens then?  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:55):**  He said, well, I leave them, just leave them on the forest floor.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:58):**  I said, well, what royalties are paid in that case?  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:08:01):**  He said, well, nothing.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:08:03):**  It was pretty distressing, right, as a young kid, to be told something like that, that  
**[0:08:08-0:08:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:08:08):**  he was my father, legally, in fact, more than legally encouraged by the state to go through  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:08:15):**  the state forest chopping down huge grey gums with the expectation that there wouldn't be  
**[0:08:21-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:08:21):**  enough timber in them to make it worthwhile harvesting for the local sawmill.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:08:28):**  And in his career, of course, he chopped down thousands of trees of that sort.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:08:33):**  And they were just left.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:08:34):**  And then think about all of the other damage that is inflicted on the native forest because  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:08:41):**  of the work that has to be done by bulldozers and sniggers and so on to get to those logs  
**[0:08:46-0:08:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:08:46):**  and the kind of incidental damage that's done to waterways and the introduction of weeds  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:08:53):**  and all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:08:55):**  And it's a bit of a mess.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:08:58):**  I guess, maybe that's the reason, maybe that's the principal reason, it would certainly be  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:09:03):**  one reason why, at an early age, I developed an interest in public policy.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:09:08):**  I'm pretty sure it's got something to do with the fact that eventually I ended up Secretary  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:09:15):**  of Treasury, which is my senior economic policy advising role in Australia.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:09:20):**  And I, in that job, took very seriously the obligations of policy advisors to ensure that  
**[0:09:28-0:09:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:09:28):**  governments were aware of the environmental consequences of decisions that they were taking.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:09:37):**  And it was actually while I was in that role, when I got the opportunity, my wife and I  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:09:42):**  and both of us were at that time, in our spare time, rescuing and rehabilitating and releasing  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:09:49):**  injured wildlife.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:09:50):**  And we'd been doing that for some years.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:09:53):**  And we became aware of the Epping Forest National Park, which is a scientific national park  
**[0:09:59-0:10:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:09:59):**  in central Queensland, which at that time was home to the last remaining colony of Northern

**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:10:13):**  national park.

**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:10:23):**  because it was in the middle of 2008.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:10:27):**  And after getting back to Canberra from Epping Forest National Park, a couple of months later,  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:10:34):**  Lehman Brothers collapsed in the United States and the global financial crisis hit us.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:10:38):**  So it was a rather peculiar year, 2008, but I still consider the most rewarding thing  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:10:44):**  I did in that year was caretaking.

**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:10:53):**  issues, in my study of economics, I was always trying to reconcile the two and not to look

**[0:11:04-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:11:04):**  a framing of economic issues and a framing of environmental issues that had some consistency.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:11:13):**  And in fact, you don't have to look that hard.

**[0:18:02-0:18:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:18:02):**  Farmers are looking forward to the development of markets in tradable instruments.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:18:10):**  These markets will, as you know, probably start with carbon credits.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:18:16):**  And for farmers, there'll be two opportunities.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:18:20):**  First is in soil carbon or anyway, some form of terrestrial carbon, it could be soil, it  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:18:26):**  could of course be vegetation.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:18:28):**  But then on top of that, there is the possibility to stack on top of the carbon credit or mingle  
**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:18:36):**  with the carbon credit, an index of environmental condition or change in environmental condition  
**[0:18:42-0:18:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:18:42):**  over time.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:18:44):**  And the expectation is, and I think this is well founded, that those carbon credits that  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:18:49):**  have got environmental credit stacked on top of them will sell at a premium.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:18:54):**  So through that, farmers will have a commercial incentive not only to build up soil carbon  
**[0:19:01-0:19:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:19:01):**  and to revegetate, to trap carbon in vegetation, but also have an incentive to improve the

**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:19:12):**  It could be vegetation, obviously, but also fauna, native fauna, including birds.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:19:17):**  Flora, of course, could be water and water quality to go back to the issue we were talking

**[0:19:22-0:19:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:19:22):**  And increasingly, farmers will have access to those commercial opportunities.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:19:29):**  I love that idea, the submission of additional sets of information that attest to how well  
**[0:19:36-0:19:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:19:36):**  you do what you do.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:19:38):**  In the end, there has to be a set of things that you can measure and a standard way to  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:19:45):**  report about the change and probably also a clearinghouse of sorts that is responsible  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:19:51):**  for some sort of arbitration about whether they do or don't represent change in a positive  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:19:56):**  direction because change can go in both directions.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:00):**  And in fact, I thought immediately of the role of auditors as well, right?  
**[0:20:03-0:20:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:03):**  So it has to be audited.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:04):**  So let's unpack that a little bit.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:07):**  Firstly, you do need very, very credible, essentially unassailable scientific rigour  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:15):**  that backs the methods that are used to make assessments.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:19):**  So you do need that, there's no escaping that, right?  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:22):**  Because the thing is that, well, imagine if you had a market in tradable instruments that  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:29):**  reflected or claimed to reflect environmental condition, and then somebody pops up and says,  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:34):**  well, you know, and is able to demonstrate that the science underlying the measurement  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:38):**  is just rubbish, right?  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:40):**  Then the whole market collapses.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:41):**  So the science has to be unassailable.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:44):**  But at the same time, measurement on the ground has to be feasible and not prohibitively expensive.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:52):**  So those are the two goals.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:53):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:54):**  No, I love that perspective.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:56):**  Maybe one challenge I think there is that view of sort of generally considered scientific.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:02):**  And we saw this play out in Australia specifically with the sale of carbon credits to Microsoft  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:09):**  through the Regen network.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:11):**  And on the one hand, I guess the view of that was, there wasn't enough scientific rigour  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:15):**  in the methodology used to calculate the levels of soil carbon.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:19):**  But on the other hand, that criticism effectively was done in the open in public on publicly  
**[0:21:24-0:21:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:24):**  available data.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:26):**  I think our view on that would be, that's a market functioning.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:29):**  No, no, I agree.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:31):**  I agree.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:32):**  And so let me clarify something I said a little moment ago.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:35):**  Now, that particular transaction was what business people would call an over the counter  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:39):**  transaction.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:40):**  So there was a well informed buyer on one side of the transaction, the buyer, Microsoft  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:47):**  knew what they were buying.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:48):**  I don't think anybody was saying they didn't.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:50):**  And then on the other side of the transaction, you have obviously a willing seller.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:55):**  Well, I don't see any problem in that transaction at all.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:59):**  The risk arises for the buyer, and I'm not saying this is the case in that transaction,  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:22:06):**  but of course, in general, the risk arises with the buyer if the buyer then wants to  
**[0:22:12-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:22:12):**  sell that into a secondary market at some stage, or in particular listed on an exchange  
**[0:22:19-0:22:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:22:19):**  at some stage in the future.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:22:21):**  And the risk is that the secondary buyer is not as certain about the value as the initial  
**[0:22:29-0:22:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:22:29):**  buyer was, or that when an attempt is made to list it on an exchange, the exchange listing  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:22:36):**  rules prevent it.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:22:38):**  The exchange listing rules just say, well, hang on a second, that's not sufficiently,  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:22:42):**  doesn't have sufficient integrity for us to list it.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:22:46):**  So that's the risk.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:22:48):**  But as far as that transaction itself is concerned, I don't see any reason critical of that particular  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:22:53):**  transaction.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:22:54):**  But I do think going forward and particularly looking forward to the development of exchange  
**[0:23:01-0:23:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:23:01):**  traded products, all of us are going to have to ensure that the methodologies, the methods  
**[0:23:08-0:23:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:23:08):**  that are used in making assessments about environmental condition, and carbon as well,  
**[0:23:15-0:23:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:23:15):**  by the way, that those methods have unassailable scientific rigor.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:23:22):**  You touched on that before.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:23:23):**  And again, we're kind of fascinated by these developments as it relates to retaining the  
**[0:23:29-0:23:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:23:29):**  power of technological advancement.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:23:31):**  I mean, I think the journey of the Clean Energy Regulator recently around soil carbon methods  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:23:36):**  is seems like it has a lot of pretty good lessons in it about the ways in which if you

**[0:31:01-0:31:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:31:01):**  It is a really interesting time.

**[0:31:24-0:31:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:31:24):**  beyond carbon.

**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:31:31):**  My very real sense is that people right across the country have got their eyes and ears open

**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:32:12):**  Yes, super exciting.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:32:14):**  An economic kind of technical question in that setting, it seems like, and you referred

**[0:32:27-0:32:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:32:27):**  And it seems like the concept of additionality whilst technically justifiable is potentially  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:32:34):**  a significant disincentive for participation in those markets.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:32:38):**  I know where you're going with that question.

**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:32:48):**  as to completely undermine the outcomes that we're seeking.

**[0:33:18-0:33:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:33:18):**  So we see on one hand, an increasing amount of pressure to ensure that the emissions profile

**[0:33:40-0:33:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:33:40):**  But the second, which is a net provider of climate solutions to the rest of the economy

**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:36:05):**  So when I was when I was with the National Australia Bank, we were doing quite a lot  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:36:09):**  of work and other works continuing on natural capital, the motivator for that work on natural  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:36:15):**  capital was was actually to assist credit decision making, that is, to develop metrics  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:36:21):**  that could be used as inputs into the pricing of loans.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:36:27):**  And that's what you're talking about here.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:36:29):**  So you know, I, on several occasions, visited various parts of Australia agricultural communities  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:36:37):**  with NAB agri bankers, again, you can drive down a road that tell you they were capable  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:36:42):**  of telling you who owned every property who they banked with and whether they were a good  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:36:46):**  credit risk or a bad credit risk, but they were also so there was a lot of anecdotal  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:36:52):**  information that already informs credit decision making in the agri sector, and every farmer  
**[0:36:58-0:37:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:36:58):**  would be aware of that.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:37:00):**  But much better than anecdotal information is hard data.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:37:06):**  And that's what the natural capital work was all about was developing metrics that could  
**[0:37:13-0:37:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:37:13):**  feed directly into credit decision making.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:37:16):**  So and that means into the question of whether a relationship should exist or not, yeah,  
**[0:37:25-0:37:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:37:25):**  or even exist between a farm and a bank.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:37:28):**  Would anybody bank that farmer that kind of question, but then also to the pricing of  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:37:34):**  the loan, you know, do we have such confidence in the operations of this particular farmer  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:37:40):**  that would take some basis points, maybe quite a few basis points of the mortgage interest  
**[0:37:46-0:37:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:37:46):**  rate, or the other direction, or the other direction, or the other direction.  
**[0:37:51-0:38:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:37:51):**  I mean, I, I do remember on one trip in particular, sitting in a car with one of NAB's agri bankers  
**[0:38:00-0:38:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:38:00):**  and pointing to a succession of farms and saying, we would never touch those farms.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:38:07):**  And it seems like also, there's another set of decisions that get made, which is consumers  
**[0:38:12-0:38:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:38:12):**  expressing preference for, you know, at least have the perception of how, you know, decisions  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:38:19):**  made all the way back at the farm kind of impact the products that they're buying.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:38:24):**  And maybe that brings us all the way back to the start of the conversation where if  
**[0:38:28-0:38:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:38:28):**  as a consumer of products, I can understand, you know, the practices that might in fact  
**[0:38:34-0:38:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:38:34):**  encourage logging of trees that should never have been cut down, that we can create incentives  
**[0:38:40-0:38:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:38:40):**  of that kind as well.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:38:41):**  Do you see there being a powerful kind of message to connect farming directly consumers  
**[0:38:46-0:38:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:38:46):**  with this sort of information as well?  
**[0:38:47-0:38:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:38:47):**  Yeah, I do.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:38:48):**  It also goes to the conversation we were having about satellite imagery, right?  
**[0:38:53-0:39:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:38:53):**  Because what's at issue here is transparency and consumers expressing increasing interest  
**[0:39:00-0:39:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:39:00):**  in knowing full backstory for the products that they're consuming.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:39:07):**  And I guess the way this all comes together is that there's a big opportunity for Australia's  
**[0:39:12-0:39:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:39:12):**  farmers right now to embrace methodologies, scientifically credible methodologies that  
**[0:39:20-0:39:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:39:20):**  allow them to be fully transparent and in a way that has absolute integrity.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:39:27):**  And I think that's really what consumers are seeking.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:39:32):**  And that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.

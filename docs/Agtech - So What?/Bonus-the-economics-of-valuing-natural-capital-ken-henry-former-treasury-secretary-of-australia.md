### Agtech - So What?  (2021-01-29)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by The Agthentic Group.  In this bonus episode, I'm handing over the interviewing reins to Matthew Pryor, my business  partner, but just for this episode.  Yeah, well, we'll see about that.  Well, the reason I'm doing this is because there are few people who could better drill  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:00:21):**  into the challenges and opportunities of valuing natural capital other than you, Matthew, and  our next guest, Dr. Ken Henry.  Well, look, I'm sure Ken easily qualifies to hold that mantle, but I'll do my best to  catch up.  Many Australians will know who Ken Henry is.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:00:37):**  He's a very well respected economist and former Treasury Secretary from 2001 to 2011, where  he became known for his bold economic proposals.  And in this episode, Ken is as bold as ever in his predictions for agriculture.  I think the next year or so could see an absolute explosion in the development of financial  instruments that reward farmers for soil carbon, for other forms of terrestrial carbon, also  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:05):**  for enhancement of environmental conditions.  Matthew, before we listen to your chat with Ken, I think for our non Aussie listeners,  like myself, kind of, can you give us a bit of background?  Because surely it's rare for an economist to become almost a household name.  Yeah, well, if there is such a thing, you know, Ken Henry might actually be Australia's  
**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:23):**  most famous economist.  He's held a lot of pretty influential roles across government and the private sector,  actually.  So he was Secretary of the Treasury of Australia for a significant period during the 2000s.  And he was also on the board of the Australian Federal Reserve Bank.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:39):**  So you know, a lot of pretty deep policy there.  And it's actually probably that role that many Australians might remember him for, because  he was instrumental in Australia's response to the GFC, which actually included direct  stimulus payments to households.  And there's nothing like a bit of free money to leave an impression, I guess.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:01:57):**  Interestingly, also, he was the chair of the board of the National Australia Bank, which  is one of Australia's four big banks, and actually Australia's largest agricultural  lender.  And so has through that association also has had a pretty deep connection to ag for a long  period of time.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:14):**  But probably more than anything, Ken's known as a reformer.  He's held key roles in the development of Australian fundamental reforms to Australian  taxation policy, and also was instrumental in the formation of Australia's, let's say,  notorious emissions trading scheme.  And this is way back in 2004, when, you know, for many, many people, there was yet to be  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:36):**  any real recognition of the need for climate action.  And the ETS was a very significant, albeit failed federal policy to try and develop a  trading scheme for emissions.  And so, you know, despite the fact that that actually wasn't successfully put into policy,  it does show that Ken has been thinking about this stuff for a very long time.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:02:57):**  Yeah, wow.  Perhaps even longer than you, Matthew.  Possibly.  Yeah, possibly.  But no, Ken's really been thinking about some of these higher level economic systems questions  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:07):**  when it comes to value in carbon and natural capital and what role that will play in agriculture  for a while.  Yeah, look a little bit less in the public eye, perhaps today.  But but no less involved in kind of driving important climate action response, and in  particular with a kind of economic and sustainability lens.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:24):**  More recently, as the member of the board of a group called Accounting for Nature, Ken  has actually helped to usher in the development of a set of standards specifically for valuing  natural capital.  And as you'll hear in this episode, you know, his driving passion for recognition of natural  capital as part of an overall economic lens actually stems from his early childhood where  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:03:46):**  he was keenly interested in the natural environment.  So perhaps we'll let Ken pick up the story from here.  My interest in conservation as a young person, I think developed because of my father's occupation,  really.  He was a timber worker.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:01):**  Well, he was a timber worker when he left school.  And he left school very early.  I think he did the first year of high school, perhaps twice.  And he left school, became a timber worker.  And then after marrying, he and my mother tried their luck on a dairy farm, which went  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:23):**  broke in a drought.  And my father then went back to timber working and for the rest of his life, that's what  he was doing.  So I became a logger, mainly in state forests in the mid-north coast of New South Wales.  I, as a young fellow, was very aware of the work that he was doing and the way that he  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:04:44):**  felt about the work that he was doing.  And in particular, became very aware of the waste that was involved in the work that he  was doing, the carnage that was inflicted on the state forests of New South Wales because  of practices that were condemned by the state government at the time.  Absolutely inexplicable practices.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:06):**  I remember one afternoon, he came home from work relatively early and he was in a great  state of excitement.  And he said, boys, there were three of us.  My mother had three sons in less than three years.  He said, boys, jump in the back of the car.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:22):**  I want to show you something.  He took us down to the local sawmill and there on the back of a truck was an enormous log.  We'd never seen anything like it.  I've never seen anything like it since.  The diameter of the log, even at the thinner end, would have been perhaps 1.8 metres.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:43):**  At the thicker end, it was well over two metres.  And there was only one log on the truck.  This was a huge logging truck.  That was the log.  And he had chopped it down that day.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:05:54):**  And so I got into a discussion with him.  I was still in primary school.  I got into a discussion with him about the history of this log.  Of course, it started with the tree.  Like how big was the tree?  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:06):**  How old was the tree?  I remember him saying the tree was obviously several hundred years old.  And he told me which state forest it would come out of.  I asked him questions like how much would the log be worth?  He didn't put a monetary figure on it, but I do remember him saying, well, you'd certainly  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:26):**  get the framing for three or four timber houses out of this one log.  So clearly it was worth a bit.  I asked him how much he would have been paid for cutting the log down.  Of course, he was on the lowest award wage in the Australian Industrial Relations System,  so he didn't get paid very much for that day's work or whatever it was that was involved  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:06:48):**  in cutting the log down.  And I said, well, what, the timber mill gets the rest?  He said, no, no, no, no, no.  There are also royalties payable on this log.  And I asked him what royalties were, and he told me what royalties were.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:01):**  And I said, well, how much?  So that's a return to the people of New South Wales for you having taken this log out of  the state forest.  And he said, yeah, that's what it is, I guess.  And I said, well, how much would the royalties be?  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:14):**  And he told me it was a few dollars.  And then, you know, and I was a bit troubled by that.  And he said, well, he said, you know, perhaps you need to understand, he said, look, this  is a grey gum.  Most grey gums of this age or anything like this age have a huge hollow core in them.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:32):**  So when you top down a grey gum, you expect that it's not going to be worth anything to  the mill.  Because the mill won't take the grey gum.  It's not worth their while, unless there's at least one foot of solid timber around the  core in the middle of the tree.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:07:49):**  So most grey gums, when I cut them down, there's not that much timber around the core.  I said, well, what happens then?  He said, well, I leave them, just leave them on the forest floor.  I said, well, what royalties are paid in that case?  He said, well, nothing.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:08:03):**  It was pretty distressing, right, as a young kid, to be told something like that, that  he was my father, legally, in fact, more than legally encouraged by the state to go through  the state forest chopping down huge grey gums with the expectation that there wouldn't be  enough timber in them to make it worthwhile harvesting for the local sawmill.  And in his career, of course, he chopped down thousands of trees of that sort.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:08:33):**  And they were just left.  And then think about all of the other damage that is inflicted on the native forest because  of the work that has to be done by bulldozers and sniggers and so on to get to those logs  and the kind of incidental damage that's done to waterways and the introduction of weeds  and all that kind of stuff.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:08:55):**  And it's a bit of a mess.  I guess, maybe that's the reason, maybe that's the principal reason, it would certainly be  one reason why, at an early age, I developed an interest in public policy.  I'm pretty sure it's got something to do with the fact that eventually I ended up Secretary  of Treasury, which is my senior economic policy advising role in Australia.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:09:20):**  And I, in that job, took very seriously the obligations of policy advisors to ensure that  governments were aware of the environmental consequences of decisions that they were taking.  And it was actually while I was in that role, when I got the opportunity, my wife and I  and both of us were at that time, in our spare time, rescuing and rehabilitating and releasing  injured wildlife.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:09:50):**  And we'd been doing that for some years.  And we became aware of the Epping Forest National Park, which is a scientific national park  in central Queensland, which at that time was home to the last remaining colony of Northern  Hairy Nose Wombats.  And there was an opportunity for us to spend five weeks there as caretakers of that scientific  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:10:13):**  national park.  By the way, this particular five weeks happened to occur at a pretty strange time in history  because it was in the middle of 2008.  And after getting back to Canberra from Epping Forest National Park, a couple of months later,  Lehman Brothers collapsed in the United States and the global financial crisis hit us.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:10:38):**  So it was a rather peculiar year, 2008, but I still consider the most rewarding thing  I did in that year was caretaking.  And I think because of my passion, I guess, for environmental issues, for conservation  issues, in my study of economics, I was always trying to reconcile the two and not to look  for a distinction between the two, but to try to find common ground and to try to find  
**[0:11:04-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:11:04):**  a framing of economic issues and a framing of environmental issues that had some consistency.  And in fact, you don't have to look that hard.  The thing is that people choose not to look or have in the past chosen not to look.  One of the really terrific things of the last couple of decades is that increasingly people  are coming to the realisation that far from there being a trade off between the two things,  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:11:34):**  there's a core dependency of development upon conservation.  So to see very commercially motivated business people quite passionate about the state of  the environment, it's increasingly commonplace to encounter farmers who are deeply passionate  about environmental condition of the land for which they see themselves now as custodians.  On that point of kind of linking things together in sort of reading through the backstory of  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:12:05):**  accounting for nature and where it came from and the kind of linkage to the Wentworth Group  and even the kind of water policy initiatives, it sort of feels like looking backward now,  you might take a different view of water policy and that exact point, the kind of linkage  to lots of other things.  To me at that time, it sort of felt like water was this special concern and even maybe even  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:12:32):**  a special Australian concern, but you could go look back now and say, really, it's part  of this overall kind of climate adaptive response.  Very much so.  Very much so.  But if you think of it in, I guess, more abstract economic terms, the reason that the environment  
**[0:12:48-0:12:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:12:48):**  gets degraded typically is because there is no requirement that the true cost of the environmental  degradation be affected into commercial decision making.  I mean, that's basically it.  Even in Economics 101 students get, and I used to teach Economics 101, I taught it for  years at university.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:13:07):**  You teach students about the externalities that arise because of market transactions  and the most obvious set of externalities that arise through market transactions are  environmental externalities and they tend to be negative externalities, of course.  There is such a thing as a positive externality, but in the environment, the externalities  tend to be negative externalities.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:13:28):**  And the fact that there is no requirement for the cost of those externalities, those  external effects on people who are not parties to the transaction means, of course, that  one should expect negative externalities as a consequence of market activity.  And the other thing that you teach, that one teaches Economics 101 students about that's  highly relevant here is, of course, public goods and the importance of public goods and  
**[0:13:53-0:14:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:13:53):**  why it is the role, very much the role of governments to ensure that public goods are  provided and that public goods are not degraded.  Because there's a thing called, what economists call the free rider problem that explains  why individuals acting as individual agents will never collaborate in a way that produces  an adequate supply of public goods.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:14:18):**  And to the contrary, as individual agents, they'll have an individual incentive to degrade  public goods.  We call that, or in fact, centuries ago, that was referred to by economists as the tragedy  of the commons.  And we see that all around the place.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:14:32):**  And so using that sort of, or those frameworks to position challenges like what to do about  the management of Australia's relatively scarce water is helpful to economic policymakers.  And I do agree with you that back when water was the issue, it was the issue.  It really should have been passed in a broader context.  And I think when those issues are being discussed today, they increasingly are being put in  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:15:06):**  that broader framework.  Do you see that?  I mean, we see another way of kind of looking backwards at the Australian RBC system is  to view it as 20 years of research into climate adaptive agriculture.  And it was never done that way.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:15:21):**  It's that they went to policy settings, but it seems like we have this enormous font of  knowledge that's now actually really globally relevant because it turns out it wasn't just  an Australian water scarcity challenge.  We were on the leading edge of a very significant change.  I agree with that.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:15:39):**  Yeah, I think that is true.  And you touched on there that kind of balance point between incentive and like carrot and  stick as part of the incentive design, again, we spend a lot of time kind of thinking about  incentive design and how that motivates or not farmers to take on new innovation.  How important will the task force for disclosures around climate related and nature related  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:16:04):**  things be in terms of creating the right incentives for genuine change there?  Yeah, so this is a really interesting topic, I think.  So some of the farmers that I talked to, they don't need to be incentivized to take an interest  in the environmental condition of their properties.  Some of them actually talked to me about the sense of frustration they have in being told  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:16:26):**  by public servants sitting in Sydney or public servants sitting in Canberra that they must  do this with their property, they must do that, they must, you know, blah, blah, blah,  fence off this, do that.  Oh, and by the way, if you fence that off, we might even pay you some money.  And they got really annoyed.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:16:42):**  Not all of them, but some of them get really annoyed by it, because they say, well, hang  on a second, I, you know, I want to do this anyway.  And I have been doing this anyway.  And, you know, when we sit down, when the family sits down for dinner around the kitchen  table, what do you think we talk about?  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:16:56):**  This is exactly what we talk about is the condition of the farm.  And included in that discussion is the environmental condition of the farm, right?  They don't need incentivizing.  But then on the other hand, there are farmers who see, and sensibly see a commercial opportunity  in being able to demonstrate that they are good environmental custodians.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:17:21):**  You can think of this as a labelling and a product labelling issue.  And it is and I think it's entirely appropriate.  We have seen over the years, the rise of things like organic farming, you understand the motivation  for that, for a lot of farmers now wanting to go well beyond organic farming, they want  to be able to put a label on their product, which says, every year, we are improving the  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:17:46):**  environmental condition of our property.  For example, using the tools that Accounting for Nature provides to farmers, we can demonstrate  that we are every year improving through the actions we take improving the environmental  condition of our property.  And they see a marketing advantage in that.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:18:02):**  Farmers are looking forward to the development of markets in tradable instruments.  These markets will, as you know, probably start with carbon credits.  And for farmers, there'll be two opportunities.  First is in soil carbon or anyway, some form of terrestrial carbon, it could be soil, it  could of course be vegetation.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:18:28):**  But then on top of that, there is the possibility to stack on top of the carbon credit or mingle  with the carbon credit, an index of environmental condition or change in environmental condition  over time.  And the expectation is, and I think this is well founded, that those carbon credits that  have got environmental credit stacked on top of them will sell at a premium.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:18:54):**  So through that, farmers will have a commercial incentive not only to build up soil carbon  and to revegetate, to trap carbon in vegetation, but also have an incentive to improve the  environmental condition of their farms.  It could be vegetation, obviously, but also fauna, native fauna, including birds.  Flora, of course, could be water and water quality to go back to the issue we were talking  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:19:21):**  about a moment ago.  And increasingly, farmers will have access to those commercial opportunities.  I love that idea, the submission of additional sets of information that attest to how well  you do what you do.  In the end, there has to be a set of things that you can measure and a standard way to  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:19:45):**  report about the change and probably also a clearinghouse of sorts that is responsible  for some sort of arbitration about whether they do or don't represent change in a positive  direction because change can go in both directions.  And in fact, I thought immediately of the role of auditors as well, right?  So it has to be audited.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:04):**  So let's unpack that a little bit.  Firstly, you do need very, very credible, essentially unassailable scientific rigour  that backs the methods that are used to make assessments.  So you do need that, there's no escaping that, right?  Because the thing is that, well, imagine if you had a market in tradable instruments that  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:29):**  reflected or claimed to reflect environmental condition, and then somebody pops up and says,  well, you know, and is able to demonstrate that the science underlying the measurement  is just rubbish, right?  Then the whole market collapses.  So the science has to be unassailable.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:20:44):**  But at the same time, measurement on the ground has to be feasible and not prohibitively expensive.  So those are the two goals.  Absolutely.  No, I love that perspective.  Maybe one challenge I think there is that view of sort of generally considered scientific.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:02):**  And we saw this play out in Australia specifically with the sale of carbon credits to Microsoft  through the Regen network.  And on the one hand, I guess the view of that was, there wasn't enough scientific rigour  in the methodology used to calculate the levels of soil carbon.  But on the other hand, that criticism effectively was done in the open in public on publicly  
**[0:21:24-0:21:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:24):**  available data.  I think our view on that would be, that's a market functioning.  No, no, I agree.  I agree.  And so let me clarify something I said a little moment ago.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:35):**  Now, that particular transaction was what business people would call an over the counter  transaction.  So there was a well informed buyer on one side of the transaction, the buyer, Microsoft  knew what they were buying.  I don't think anybody was saying they didn't.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:21:50):**  And then on the other side of the transaction, you have obviously a willing seller.  Well, I don't see any problem in that transaction at all.  The risk arises for the buyer, and I'm not saying this is the case in that transaction,  but of course, in general, the risk arises with the buyer if the buyer then wants to  sell that into a secondary market at some stage, or in particular listed on an exchange  
**[0:22:19-0:22:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:22:19):**  at some stage in the future.  And the risk is that the secondary buyer is not as certain about the value as the initial  buyer was, or that when an attempt is made to list it on an exchange, the exchange listing  rules prevent it.  The exchange listing rules just say, well, hang on a second, that's not sufficiently,  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:22:42):**  doesn't have sufficient integrity for us to list it.  So that's the risk.  But as far as that transaction itself is concerned, I don't see any reason critical of that particular  transaction.  But I do think going forward and particularly looking forward to the development of exchange  
**[0:23:01-0:23:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:23:01):**  traded products, all of us are going to have to ensure that the methodologies, the methods  that are used in making assessments about environmental condition, and carbon as well,  by the way, that those methods have unassailable scientific rigor.  You touched on that before.  And again, we're kind of fascinated by these developments as it relates to retaining the  
**[0:23:29-0:23:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:23:29):**  power of technological advancement.  I mean, I think the journey of the Clean Energy Regulator recently around soil carbon methods  is seems like it has a lot of pretty good lessons in it about the ways in which if you  take a purely science led approach, you might tend to be a bit more prescriptive and sort  of process based rather than trying hard to be outcome based and allowing technology to  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:23:54):**  do its job, which is exactly what you said, lower the cost of doing things at high accuracy.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I think that's the holy grail for all of us really is to be able to secure sufficient  comfort around scientific integrity, but at acceptably low cost.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:24:11):**  But what we also see, and I think this is technologically driven, I guess the concept  we call the concept the factory has no roof.  And it's something in a way it's quite unique to agriculture.  Because especially today with 30 centimeter resolution satellites, everything you do can  easily be observed.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:24:32):**  And so it's not just that the product gets to market with the right attribution, but  that at every stage along the way, there will be people forming opinions about how well  you're doing what you're doing.  It's actually quite confronting, isn't it?  Yes.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:24:49):**  Yes.  And it's quite a small dairy farm, well, it used to be a dairy farm, it's no longer a  dairy farm ourselves.  And as I'm walking across the paddocks, I often reflect on that.  Somebody's watching this, or if they're not, they could be.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:25:03):**  They could be watching at a quite low expense too, by the way.  And they're able to observe pretty much in real time, the way in which we are managing  this property.  And that's quite something to ponder.  You can feel threatened by that or not, but it's just a fact of life, isn't it?  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:25:29):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  But there's a great opportunity that comes with it.  I think that's what we would want people to focus their attention on, which is we're proud  of the way this land is managed.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:25:41):**  Exactly.  And we welcome them with the oversight.  We are open, we are transparent.  Take a look at this magnificent farm that I've got and the way that I'm managing it  and look at its improvement over time.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:25:53):**  And the fact is, you don't have to have a look at satellite imagery to get a sense of  how people are managing their farms.  Every day as I drive along a country road, I certainly pay attention to what the neighbouring  farmers are doing.  I look at what they're doing.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:26:10):**  They're all very well aware of what's happening in our place.  I know that.  Yeah, that's funny, right?  Like, it's definitely a thing to look over the neighbour's fence, but it feels a very  different thing to have someone looking over your shoulder from higher up.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:26:24):**  But you know, the thing is, as you said, see it as an opportunity, right?  As an opportunity to demonstrate to the world what a wonderful job you're doing.  Yeah.  And that's actually like to kind of tap into your economist brain here for a minute too,  because I think in that frame where this is a global problem, and really Australia, you  
**[0:26:45-0:26:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:26:45):**  know, I think very credibly can claim to be a world leader in climate adaptive agriculture.  Now, we can become a bigger producer, and we have an aspiration to become a larger producer  of actual output, farm-based output.  But we could also participate in what is estimated to be a multi-hundred billion dollar market  for products and services around, you know, climate adaptive agriculture.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:27:12):**  One of the things that struck me when I was back in 2012, I suppose, was leading the development  of the white paper on Australia in the Asian century, which is something I did for the  Gillard government, traveling through Asia, talking to very, very senior people, and just  getting a sense of the burgeoning middle class, in particular China and India, and the enormous  demand for agricultural produce that was going to come out of those two countries over the  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:27:51):**  next several decades.  We're still really only at the beginning of it.  If Australia only targeted the top one percent of the middle class consumers in those two  countries, the market for Australian produce would be absolutely enormous.  And so the question is, what does it take to be successful in that top one percent of  
**[0:28:13-0:28:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:28:13):**  the burgeoning middle class consumer market in, say, China and India and other countries  in the region?  And what it takes is an absolute commitment to quality.  Climate adaptive, climate friendly, environmentally sustainable, and so on.  Those things are obviously the key today.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:28:36):**  And if we manage to secure a strong position in those markets today, then decades to come,  the commercial returns for Australian farmers should be very, very attractive.  And what about, so from a policy settings point of view, Australia hasn't really thought  of itself as an exporter of knowledge economy related products, and certainly not as far  as agriculture is concerned.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:28:59):**  It's funny, you know, we tend to export the businesses that are created, sell them off  to larger commercial concerns in other places.  We haven't been very good at learning how to develop the businesses here.  It's not that we're incapable of coming up with the ideas.  I mean, I would like to challenge you on that actually a little bit, because I think it's  
**[0:29:25-0:29:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:29:25):**  a process in fact, and I think whilst it's definitely true that we don't hold on to companies  as long as we might, sometimes an industry needs a kind of baseline of people who have  built and exited businesses to kind of get enough momentum in it to then, if you look  at just straight tech now, you know, we've reached escape philosophy, right?  So we now can retain globally significant tech companies in Australia and they can grow  
**[0:29:53-0:29:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:29:53):**  and take on the world without having to sell to a larger.  That's true.  That's true.  I do stand corrected on that one.  You're absolutely right.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:30:01):**  Yeah.  And we have to prove ourselves capable of doing that in other sectors as well.  And I mean, we certainly have great passion for that happening in the agri-tech sector,  if that's what we might call it.  I'm interested also in sort of backtracking a little onto this concept of, you know, the  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:30:20):**  incentives of environmental measurement and the degree to which that overlaps or doesn't  overlap, perhaps as the case has been, you know, federal government policy in particular,  it feels that there is a significant shift taking place right now as it regards to agriculture's  role in a kind of broader emissions sort of set of standards.  And as we progress toward Glasgow, you know, the role of regenerative and other systems  
**[0:30:51-0:30:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:30:51):**  that focus on those dual purposes for agriculture seem to be very much in the frame as far as  government policy is concerned.  Yeah, very much so.  It is a really interesting time.  So both the Federal Agriculture Minister and also the Federal Energy Minister, or rather  
**[0:31:09-0:31:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:31:09):**  Minister for Climate and Energy, demonstrated that they are really, really interested in  this space.  And by the way, they've demonstrated that they're interested not only in carbon, but  beyond carbon.  So they're interested in, well, let's call it environmental condition of the farm.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:31:31):**  My very real sense is that people right across the country have got their eyes and ears open  on this one and on both these things and see a real opportunity right now to make a very  big difference.  And that's true of farmers, but it's also true of intermediaries, right, including the  carbon aggregators that people are familiar with.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:31:52):**  They're very, very wide awake to what is happening.  I think the next year or so could see an absolute explosion in the development of financial  instruments that reward farmers for soil carbon, for other forms of terrestrial carbon, also  for enhancement of environmental condition.  Yes, super exciting.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:32:14):**  An economic kind of technical question in that setting, it seems like, and you referred  specifically to the fact that many farmers are already doing much of this.  And it seems like the concept of additionality whilst technically justifiable is potentially  a significant disincentive for participation in those markets.  I know where you're going with that question.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:32:41):**  And I think we have to be really, really careful not to be so pedantic about additionality  as to completely undermine the outcomes that we're seeking.  That's the real risk.  So we do need a pragmatic approach and just do not lose sight of the outcomes that we're  after.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:33:04):**  It feels a little bit like that at the moment that we've allowed great to become the enemy  of good.  And there are fewer people participating than might otherwise based on overly technical  interpretation.  Yeah, we can't allow that to happen.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:33:18):**  So we see on one hand, an increasing amount of pressure to ensure that the emissions profile  if we just stuck to emissions, because I suppose that's the frame really for heading to Glasgow,  the emissions profile of agriculture, enteric emissions in particular, because we are a  livestock heavy system.  So there's one set of initiatives that look to make that profile as favorable as possible.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:33:40):**  But the second, which is a net provider of climate solutions to the rest of the economy  that may have a higher cost to decarbonize.  How should we view those?  How should we balance the two?  And is there a risk in some ways of over focusing on agricultural emissions when decarbonization  
**[0:34:03-0:34:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:34:03):**  of energy also needs a lot of work?  It's true that the decarbonization of energy needs a lot of work.  But by the way, there's a hell of a lot happening.  But I really think that this has to be maybe it's not unambiguously good news for the agricultural  sector, but it's overwhelmingly good news for the agriculture sector is that the rest  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:34:21):**  of the economy, or at least those parts of the economy that are finding all those businesses  that find it very difficult to achieve net zero within their own operations, it's a completely  new opportunity for agriculture.  That agricultural enterprises could have a commercial relationship with other businesses  that have absolutely nothing to do with agriculture, nothing at all to do with agriculture.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:34:47):**  And the relationship is developed because of a common interest in emissions reduction.  And the agricultural provider, the farmer, essentially being the seller of a product,  an intangible product, of course, but a product to a business that never had any connection  with agriculture.  And by the way, and it's not just the potential to sell these intangible products to other  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:35:15):**  Australian businesses, there's a potential to sell them global.  Yeah, not we standing wherever the Paris sort of discussion ends up as far as as far as  export is concerned.  So I love that idea that diversification of income, if you might call it that by having  financial relationship with with non supply chain aligned participants.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:35:35):**  But on the other hand, it also seems so you touched on briefly the idea of sustainability  linked loans and other things that are much more within the system.  Absolutely.  Love to hear your comment on kind of the relative degrees, you know, so whether that's, you  know, grid pricing improvements that the process it might give me because I can deliver, you  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:35:56):**  know, zero carbon B for the favorable financial conditions that might be afforded to me by  a lender, because again, I can demonstrate on lower risk.  So when I was when I was with the National Australia Bank, we were doing quite a lot  of work and other works continuing on natural capital, the motivator for that work on natural  capital was was actually to assist credit decision making, that is, to develop metrics  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:36:21):**  that could be used as inputs into the pricing of loans.  And that's what you're talking about here.  So you know, I, on several occasions, visited various parts of Australia agricultural communities  with NAB agri bankers, again, you can drive down a road that tell you they were capable  of telling you who owned every property who they banked with and whether they were a good

But much better than anecdotal information is hard data.  And that's what the natural capital work was all about was developing metrics that could  
**[0:37:13-0:37:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:37:13):**  feed directly into credit decision making.  So and that means into the question of whether a relationship should exist or not, yeah,  or even exist between a farm and a bank.  Would anybody bank that farmer that kind of question, but then also to the pricing of  the loan, you know, do we have such confidence in the operations of this particular farmer  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:37:40):**  that would take some basis points, maybe quite a few basis points of the mortgage interest  rate, or the other direction, or the other direction, or the other direction.  I mean, I, I do remember on one trip in particular, sitting in a car with one of NAB's agri bankers  and pointing to a succession of farms and saying, we would never touch those farms.  And it seems like also, there's another set of decisions that get made, which is consumers  
**[0:38:12-0:38:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:38:12):**  expressing preference for, you know, at least have the perception of how, you know, decisions  made all the way back at the farm kind of impact the products that they're buying.  And maybe that brings us all the way back to the start of the conversation where if  as a consumer of products, I can understand, you know, the practices that might in fact  encourage logging of trees that should never have been cut down, that we can create incentives  
**[0:38:40-0:38:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:38:40):**  of that kind as well.  Do you see there being a powerful kind of message to connect farming directly consumers  with this sort of information as well?  Yeah, I do.  It also goes to the conversation we were having about satellite imagery, right?  
**[0:38:53-0:39:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/28/the-economics-of-valuing-natural-capital-ken-henry#t=0:38:53):**  Because what's at issue here is transparency and consumers expressing increasing interest  in knowing full backstory for the products that they're consuming.  And I guess the way this all comes together is that there's a big opportunity for Australia's  farmers right now to embrace methodologies, scientifically credible methodologies that  allow them to be fully transparent and in a way that has absolute integrity.

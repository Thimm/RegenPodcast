### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 27 Jan 2021 19:01:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast, brought to you by the Agthente Group.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:00:07):**  I'm Sarah Nolet. So you've just clicked on this episode about Coca-Cola and you might  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:00:12):**  be wondering, well, what does Coke have to do with Ag Tech and farming? Well, more than  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:00:17):**  you may think. For one, the Coca-Cola company happens to be the largest commercial buyer  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:00:22):**  of sugar globally. And while their high sugar drinks certainly haven't earned them any gold  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:00:27):**  stars from nutritionists, we're interested in what the company is doing in terms of innovation  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:00:32):**  and sustainable sourcing. Recently, Coke has launched multiple sustainability initiatives  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:00:37):**  focused on growing practices for ingredients and packaging. And while they don't deal directly  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:00:42):**  with farmers, the sheer scale and influence of the global company means it's inevitably  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:00:48):**  going to impact supply chains and ultimately, farming practices. I totally understand that  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:00:53):**  farmers will perceive the sustainability push as a pressure and as an additional burden.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:00:58):**  I mean, I totally get that. But I also think that if you take a step back and you look  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:01:04):**  really at where a lot of the agricultural practices have developed over the last 50  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:01:08):**  or 60 years and where the future is, given our whole context is changing, just look at  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:01:14):**  the availability of water and look at climate change, it can't go on like this. I think  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:01:19):**  we all know that.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:01:21):**  That's Ulrika Cepiro, the Senior Director of Global Water Stewardship and Sustainable  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:01:26):**  Agriculture at the Coca-Cola Company. Ulrika is based in Belgium, but responsible for projects  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:01:31):**  all over the world. In this episode, we talk about the increasing involvement the company  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:01:36):**  is having in agriculture, from a development program for orange growers in Brazil, to a  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:01:41):**  peer viewed production standard for sugarcane in Australia. Now, you might have some skepticism  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:01:46):**  about one of the world's most well known brands and their role in sustainability. Like, is  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:01:51):**  it just talk or even worse, like greenwashing? There certainly are marketing benefits for  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:01:56):**  Coca-Cola and Ulrika will talk about that. But there's also a shift in the way multinationals  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:02:01):**  like Coca-Cola are thinking about and influencing agriculture and sustainability all along the  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:02:07):**  supply chain. Hopefully, that's a key insight that you'll get from this conversation. But  
**[0:02:11-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:02:11):**  if you disagree, be sure to let us know. So first, let's properly meet Ulrika.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:02:17):**  You might detect a slight twang in my accent. I'm German and I grew up in Germany. I've  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:02:23):**  left 20 years ago already. So I grew up sort of in between sort of half town or urban environment  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:02:29):**  and half nature. So between what happened in the week and what happens the weekend and  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:02:33):**  the holidays was very different environments. And I think that's quite a nice metaphor as  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:02:38):**  well for what reality is now in my role, which is about this bridging of really the goals  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:02:43):**  of a multinational company and suppliers or farmers, people with completely different  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:02:49):**  and businesses with completely different interests or perspectives. And so, I wouldn't say that  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:02:53):**  I've grown up on one side or the other in this bridging sort of situation. And I think  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:02:59):**  that's a good ability to have, especially on sustainability, which is seeping really  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:03:03):**  through all aspects of business, of life, of what we need to do and where we need to  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:03:08):**  change as a society. Did you have a particular passion for farming  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:03:13):**  or agriculture growing up or how did you, like as a child or as a kid or thinking about  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:03:18):**  a career, did you want to work in food and agriculture?  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:03:21):**  No, I had no idea. Actually, my real sort of passion point, if you can call it, and  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:03:26):**  what I studied ultimately, which is sort of probably a manifestation of a certain passion  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:03:31):**  at the time, was history and politics. So I mean, really nothing to do with it. It's  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:03:35):**  more of a personal, was a personal interest. And my rural half, I'd say of my upbringing  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:03:41):**  was really more to do with forests, actually, than with farming. So we had a cabin in the  
**[0:03:45-0:03:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:03:45):**  woods and a combination of forestry and orchards, stone fruit orchards that were sort of situated  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:03:52):**  within the clearings of the forest, which for that region is a very traditional way  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:03:56):**  of fruit growing. So actually, that I only learned actually in my current role that looking  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:02):**  back at it to understand what the agricultural landscape was that I grew up in, I took it  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:07):**  for granted it was the way it was. But getting that context was really just coming back to  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:11):**  me very much later.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:13):**  I love it. It's funny how those different, I guess, threads connect something that you've  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:17):**  done your whole life and then you didn't realize that it was a certain way or a certain lens  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:21):**  on it from a different vantage point. That happens a lot, I think. So tell me about your  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:25):**  current role.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:26):**  Right. So the last three years nearly, I have been a global lead for strategy and programs  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:33):**  and policy at the Coca-Cola Company for water stewardship and sustainable agriculture. So  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:39):**  within our sustainability team in the corporate center, I lead those two topics as a subject  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:44):**  matter expert. And of course, then on implementation with the functions that actually do have and  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:50):**  hold the relationships. So either with technical who hold the relationship with our bottling  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:53):**  partners or with procurement who obviously work closely with the suppliers. So on the  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:58):**  agricultural side in particular, I have a very close relationship with procurement and  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:05:02):**  the teams that do supply engagement.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:05:05):**  So you mentioned a bunch of topics there around social and environmental and risk. Tell me  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:05:11):**  a little bit about how the Coca-Cola Company is thinking about sustainability and maybe  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:05:15):**  how that's changed. I feel like there's been a bit of a shift recently that it's really  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:05:21):**  hit the mainstream. It isn't sort of this niche thing off to the side that we have to  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:05:25):**  do, but I'd be curious your experience and how the company thinks about it.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:05:30):**  So sustainability, I mean, on the highest level, the first principles is for us an opportunity  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:05:36):**  to enable growth for the business in the long term, but also to manage our risks effectively.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:05:40):**  I mean, these are the basic principles of how we look at sustainability. And that then  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:05:46):**  leads to really a look across the board of what sustainability means in the social, economic  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:05:51):**  and environmental side and how that relates to our business. We do regularly, of course,  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:05:56):**  materiality assessments for our sustainability risks. And that is evolving. There are certain  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:06:01):**  issues that come up all the time and every time you do a review, others emerge. But by  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:06:07):**  and large, as I mentioned, the issues that we're really focusing and prioritizing at  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:06:12):**  the moment are definitely around environment, world without waste, sustainable packaging  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:06:18):**  strategy, our climate policy, we have a science-based climate target, agriculture and water, which  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:06:24):**  is very closely connected. And water stewardship has been a very strong priority for the last  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:06:29):**  decades, I would say. And then human rights and community empowerment are definitely the  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:06:34):**  others on the social side, the big issues. Now, it doesn't mean that it's all we do,  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:06:38):**  but this is really where we put a lot of external internal focus and attention to. So this is  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:06:43):**  how we see it. And we have also what has perhaps shifted and is worthwhile mentioning is that  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:06:48):**  you will have heard that a lot of corporates talked about the need to define purpose for  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:06:52):**  their business. And this led to a huge discussion in the company because a lot of the discussion,  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:06:59):**  the opinions about this purpose was how do we embed what we say about sustainability

**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:07:09):**  need this? We've done sustainability in these different aspects for a long, long time. Why  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:07:13):**  do we need this now in a purpose? But in the end, actually, we had our leadership team  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:07:19):**  and actually our CEO directly drafting our purpose statement, which was just launched  
**[0:07:24-0:07:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:07:24):**  a year ago, actually now a year ago, and says broadly that our purpose is about refreshing  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:07:31):**  the world and making a difference. And we do that by producing love brands done sustainably  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:07:36):**  for a better shared future. It's very simple words, a few sentences, but it actually has  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:07:40):**  helped us hugely to anchor decision making and prioritization through COVID and this  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:07:46):**  whole last year to say, okay, if this is our purpose, if this is the North Star, then logically  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:07:51):**  certain decisions have to be taken in a certain way. And so I think it clarified a lot.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:07:57):**  What's an example of that? Like, tell me how that's kind of playing out or what decisions  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:08:00):**  or an example of how that might look.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:08:03):**  Yeah. So for example, I mean, one of the first things, of course, is about how do we react  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:08:09):**  directly to the pandemic crisis in terms of keeping our employees safe, stepping over  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:08:15):**  all the lines to work with our potlors and making sure that their employees are safe,  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:08:19):**  engaging with our suppliers as well to offer support and assistance and manage those relationships  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:08:24):**  first and foremost with an interest on safety of employees, but then very quickly shifting  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:08:30):**  towards the idea of our purpose, a better shared future. I think overall, the first  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:08:34):**  half year, half of this year, we invested about 120 million US dollars across the foundation  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:08:41):**  and the business in just community support. And that was anything from productive equipment  
**[0:08:46-0:08:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:08:46):**  to sanitizing equipment, to supporting community groups, to commercial support, to small businesses  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:08:53):**  all the way to providing hygiene and hand washing facilities.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:08:58):**  One of the comments that we get from listeners, especially when we talk to larger companies  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:09:02):**  in food and ag is sometimes like, oh, this is just marketing BS. Like they're just green  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:09:07):**  washing and they don't really care. And it's something they do on the side. It's not really  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:09:11):**  baked into who they are. And so I guess I'm curious what your response to that would be.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:09:17):**  Yeah. And the first response is I do understand the skepticism, especially from a huge global  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:09:23):**  brand, consumer brand that you would think that way. But if that was true, then we would  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:09:29):**  have done much more marketing about it. And frankly, we haven't at all. We've done our  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:09:34):**  thing. You're transparent about it. You can look at our website and we have really clearly  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:09:39):**  listed out our actions and examples, but we haven't turned that into marketing. So actually  
**[0:09:44-0:09:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:09:44):**  much to the contrary, we also stopped essentially all our external marketing spend in the first  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:09:51):**  quarter down into the second quarter of this year and reinvested a good part of that money  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:09:57):**  into that community support. One of the other things that gets talked about  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:10:01):**  is that sustainability is this sort of burden that's getting pushed on to producers or onto  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:10:07):**  farmers and especially with smallholder farmers that maybe have less capacity to respond.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:10:13):**  But you were talking about partnerships and communities. So maybe talk a little bit about  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:10:18):**  what you're doing that's producer facing, like what's the trade off between opportunities  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:10:22):**  versus burdens and kind of how that's benefiting producers?  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:10:27):**  Yeah, that's a very good question. Of course, it's the ultimate conundrum that we face in  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:10:33):**  sustainability in particular with regards to agriculture because of course the distance  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:10:38):**  in reality or in daily operating environment between a multinational that is ultimately  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:10:44):**  using the product at the farmer who is a very different environment is just so stark, right?  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:10:49):**  So these worlds are so different. But I think that a couple of things I need to probably  
**[0:10:55-0:11:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:10:55):**  get to this question. The first is I totally understand that farmers will perceive the  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:11:02):**  sustainability push as a pressure and as an additional burden. I totally get that. But  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:11:07):**  I also think that if you take a step back and you look really at where a lot of the  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:11:11):**  agricultural practices have developed over the last 50 or 60 years and where the future  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:11:16):**  is given our whole context is changing, just look at the availability of water, look at  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:11:22):**  climate change, it can't go on like this. I think we all know that. That's the first  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:11:27):**  thing. The second thing is it actually isn't in the interest of farmers to continue operating  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:11:31):**  often in the way they do. And again, there is not one farmer. There are so many different  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:11:36):**  farm structures, so many different markets. There is not one solution, one problem. But  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:11:40):**  overall we haven't found a way to actually integrate in our thinking about finances and  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:11:46):**  economics around farming all the externalities that are being produced or impacted. And if  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:11:52):**  we were to be honest in quantifying all those impacts, we probably would have a very different  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:11:56):**  look at the productivity or the value that is generated. And only if we can do that,  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:12:02):**  I guess then we will have a different view of what sustainability practices do. So that's  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:12:07):**  just a starting point. I do understand the pressure and the feeling of burden, but I  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:12:12):**  also think we need to get over this because we know it's not going to continue like that.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:12:16):**  The other thing I need to say about the Coca-Cola companies' particular specific role is I need  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:12:23):**  to caveat that with sort of explaining a little bit where we sit in the supply chain and how  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:12:27):**  we're organized, right? Because again, there is not one farmer, there is not one company.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:12:32):**  Not all food and beverage manufacturers are organized the same way of what they buy and  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:12:36):**  where they buy it and how they procure it. And in our case, Coca-Cola is of course, given  
**[0:12:41-0:12:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:12:41):**  the name obviously, is most associated with its main consumer brand, Coca-Cola. But we  
**[0:12:48-0:12:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:12:48):**  have developed into a very diversified beverage company, right? We do not only sparkling soft  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:12:55):**  drinks, we do juice drinks, juices, we have plant-based drinks, we have coffee, we have  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:13:00):**  teas, we have dairy most recently added to the portfolio. So really a wide variety of  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:13:05):**  products. And so if we are diversifying what we sell, we obviously also diversifying what  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:13:10):**  we buy. So quite a raft of different ingredients. But I say ingredients because we don't buy  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:13:17):**  agricultural raw materials, we don't buy the commodities directly, we do buy processed  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:13:22):**  refined ingredients from processes. So we have certainly at least one if not several  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:13:28):**  intermediates in the supply chain. And we don't hold a direct relationship with farmers  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:13:33):**  by and large. Again, this is changing as the business is changing, there are shorter and  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:13:38):**  longer supply chains, but by and large, we don't have the direct relationship with the  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:13:41):**  farmers. So our lever in engaging on agriculture is through the suppliers and building the  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:13:46):**  relationship and the common understanding with the suppliers and then leverage that  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:13:50):**  to make scale at the farm level.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:13:54):**  There are two ways at least that the Coca Cola company engages with their upstream supply  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:13:58):**  chain to influence practices and outcomes on farm.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:14:01):**  There are two tracks to it. Very practically speaking, one is given what I just said, where  
**[0:14:07-0:14:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:14:07):**  we are, we work quite heavily through standards and compliance with monetary sustainability  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:14:13):**  standards, which is a way for us to get some visibility on what's happening on a farm that  
**[0:14:18-0:14:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:14:18):**  is not directly connected to our business. And secondly, through targeted and very specific  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:14:25):**  highlight lighthouse or demonstration projects at farm level where we actually work with

**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:15:05):**  and locations they're sourcing from. Ulrika says that's part of the reason each sustainability

**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:15:12):**  A recent example is a project in Brazil to help improve the farming practices of small  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:15:16):**  holder orange growers. They've partnered with Cutrale, Coca Cola's largest orange juice  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:15:21):**  supplier in Brazil.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:15:23):**  We buy an awful lot of orange juice in Brazil. I mean, Brazil is the orange juice producing  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:15:27):**  market for the world. First thing. Second thing is we are a large buyer of orange juice  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:15:32):**  and have a very close relationship with Cutrale. And thirdly, the orange juice sector in Brazil  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:15:37):**  has made huge progress on sustainability and really managing their challenges. But it's  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:15:43):**  really divided into the large farms that actually can manage a lot of their challenges, including  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:15:48):**  greening and pests that are coming. And the smallholder farmers who are in a much more  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:15:52):**  precarious situation. And given that they are in a precarious situation economically  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:15:57):**  and from a productivity long term yield perspective, that also leads them to deteriorating or not  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:16:03):**  to standard practices on other things like human rights, like labor, like pest management,  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:16:08):**  etc. So whilst we know that when we work with Cutrale through their own farms or the big  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:16:14):**  farms on compliance with sustainability standards, we know that it's taken care of because they  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:16:19):**  have the capability and they are achieving really very high standards. We know that the  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:16:23):**  smallholder farmers are in a different position. That's what this project is trying to really  
**[0:16:27-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:16:27):**  tackle is to say, can we work with, and in this case with 480, that's the target smallholder,  
**[0:16:34-0:16:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:16:34):**  so smaller than 50 hectares of growth, orange farmers to first understand what their challenges  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:16:42):**  are, what their gap is towards achieving sustainability standards that we would accept as in line  
**[0:16:47-0:16:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:16:47):**  with our requirements and really get to the root causes of those and set up a program  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:16:54):**  supported by technology, technical assistance, I mean the whole package essentially, to get  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:16:58):**  them towards making progress in that direction, but in a way that is interesting to them.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:17:03):**  And of course, the first way of making it interesting is to make the farm viable and  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:17:06):**  making the economics work.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:17:08):**  Yeah, the phrase that comes to mind there that I hear often in agriculture is if you're  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:17:13):**  profitable, you can consider being green, but if you're not profitable, like there's  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:17:18):**  just no kind of green sustainability on the table. You're just struggling to survive basically.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:17:22):**  And I'm imagining a farmer listening to this and saying, these sustainability programs,  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:17:26):**  you know, great, but it's, again, it's sort of a burden on me. And so what's the incentive  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:17:31):**  for me to participate in one of these programs or to think about certifications or third  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:17:35):**  party standards or changing practices even? How do you guys think about balancing the  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:17:41):**  need for this and the genuine desire to help growers with the fact that it is, whether  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:17:46):**  financially or psychologically, difficult to actually change what they're doing?  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:17:51):**  Yeah, so I mean, I do, again, I caveat what I say that I come and look at this from a  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:17:56):**  completely different part of the supply chain of the whole chain of command that is going  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:18:02):**  on and looking at it from the outside. But there is this argument indeed that, you know,  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:18:08):**  the first it has to, the farm has to make money and then it can look into sustainability.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:18:13):**  The more I see the evidence and particular now again, as we look into baselining or assessing  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:18:19):**  where farmers are in the beginning of such projects, you actually start to wonder, is  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:18:24):**  it that they are not economically sustainable because they're economically viable, because  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:18:29):**  they're not sustainable? Because their practices are such that actually it doesn't make sense  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:18:34):**  economically ultimately either. So give me like you give me an example. If a farm is  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:18:39):**  gotten into a position where basically it is just a monoculture and the entire landscape  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:18:44):**  is just the same rootstock and canopy of orange trees, all the same varieties, of course,  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:18:50):**  it is much more prone to capture pests in particular as the general pest level and vectors  
**[0:18:55-0:19:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:18:55):**  are increasing. If you then add that the overuse of pesticides that is killing also natural  
**[0:19:02-0:19:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:19:02):**  predators of pests, these are all practices that we would call sustainability practices.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:19:08):**  But actually, at the end of the day, it is impacting your productivity because you are  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:19:13):**  much more pest prone. It increases your base costs because you use much more pesticides  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:19:18):**  and aqua chemicals. And so, it is actually the unsustainable practices that make you  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:19:22):**  not being economically viable rather than the other way around. And what we need to  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:19:26):**  try to find together is the starting point to turn a vicious cycle into a virtuous cycle  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:19:32):**  and say, what is the first thing that we can do to turn around to actually start turning  
**[0:19:37-0:19:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:19:37):**  the wheel the other direction? And I guess costs and input costs and how we think holistically  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:19:44):**  about how we are using those is one of them. But it is also about basic business acumen  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:19:48):**  and skills, right? Do you know your costs? Have you understood where you are actually  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:19:53):**  spending your money? Some of those basics, if you start identifying them cleverly and  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:19:57):**  help farmers to move around, I think then you are in a different place. The challenge  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:20:02):**  is finding that point and probably incentivizing and funding the initial turnaround and adaptation  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:20:09):**  time. It is not about the long-term sustainability benefits. I think that by now is pretty much  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:20:14):**  understood. It is the sort of initial turnover time that you need of four or five years,  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:20:19):**  I suppose, depending that you need to cover. Yeah, it is fascinating. I actually did work  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:20:24):**  in my masters on transition to organic farming, looking at smallholder farmers in India growing  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:20:29):**  wheat. And what we found was this sort of exactly like you are saying, a worse before  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:20:33):**  better. And so then the interesting kind of system design principle is how do you cover  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:20:37):**  the worse before better to incentivize that transition? And it is not just the cost. Like  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:20:42):**  you could sort of say, look, here is what it will look like and here is the money. But  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:20:45):**  it is actually also about the psychology of like what if it doesn't work? What if the  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:20:49):**  worse is worse? Like I don't, this whole better part is so uncertain. It is different behaviors,  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:20:53):**  different practices. So that psychological part I think is actually almost as hard, if  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:20:57):**  not harder than the financial part in terms of that transition.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:21:01):**  That's absolutely right. And I think it leads then to another aspect, which is such projects  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:21:07):**  usually only last three to four years, right? And then you move on to something else. But  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:21:11):**  to have actual behavior change takes so much more, just longer. So as soon as I, I often  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:21:17):**  see that as soon as the first challenge hits, farmers or anyone, I'm not making it particular  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:21:22):**  to farmers, this is a natural behavior, you reverse back to what you know, what you've  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:21:25):**  done 20 years before, just because you've done something different for two or half years,  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:21:30):**  is you know, it's not enough embedded and ingrained and you're not having the confidence.

**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:21:39):**  you know, how can you embed ongoing technical assistance, how you can embed ongoing coaching  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:21:45):**  to farmers into, you know, the legacy of a project, so that they're not just left on  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:21:50):**  their own and fight for themselves after you've decided the transition time is over.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:21:54):**  Yeah, exactly. And I guess that it strikes me that the, you know, you guys as a company  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:22:00):**  are really at the consumer side, understanding what consumers want and where those drivers  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:22:05):**  are coming from. But as you were describing, like you don't really have control of shifting  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:22:10):**  the system necessarily, you've got incentives, and you've got connections, and you've got  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:22:14):**  a stick or a carrot, I'm sure you can wield, but it's not like you can stab your fingers  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:22:18):**  and grow something differently tomorrow, because you'd actually do the growing. So it seems  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:22:22):**  to me that there's then an incentive to sort of get closer to the producers, and whether  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:22:27):**  that's through partnerships or more vertical integration, you mentioned different kinds  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:22:32):**  of supply chains. But I'm curious, is that is my intuition there correct?  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:22:36):**  Well, certainly these projects is part of that growing, better understanding. I think  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:22:41):**  for us, it's also about growing an understanding and embedding that understanding about farmer  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:22:45):**  realities into our way of thinking, right? This is, yes, you say we are a consumer marketing  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:22:50):**  company to 99.5% of the business. So getting people to think differently about that part  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:22:57):**  by having in mind what the beginning of the supply chain in fact, in particular, is part  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:23:02):**  of that sort of just psychological mindset shift that we have to take. And so these projects  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:23:08):**  are part of that, is helping the understanding, but also giving our weight, our name, our  
**[0:23:12-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:23:12):**  volume as well. I think we are buying each amount of volume into the topic and the interest  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:23:19):**  and really our commitment to sustainability and making that case. I think there is that  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:23:24):**  role that we have as well as a convener, as a promoter, as a communicator. I think I wouldn't  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:23:30):**  underestimate that. But I'd also say that I've seen an awful lot of change and positive  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:23:36):**  change in these intermediate supply chains. So certainly not the impression that I want  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:23:41):**  to make that we go now and we just jumped right to the front, let's say of the queue  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:23:45):**  and say we go speak directly to farmers. It's not our role, it's the most effective way  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:23:51):**  of doing things. I see increasingly that we've over the past years had our suppliers really  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:23:57):**  pick up on the sustainability agenda and really actually owning it and actually leading it  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:24:02):**  by themselves. And that's the right place, I think, for us to make the influence not  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:24:06):**  only stick and carry, but actually the influence and the ownership of a sustainability agenda  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:24:12):**  and having a greater understanding of the benefits within the supply chain with suppliers  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:24:16):**  to actually own it. We've seen a huge uptake and that's why partnering with suppliers like  
**[0:24:21-0:24:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:24:21):**  Cutral in Brazil or of course also in Australia or on sugarcane in India is so important because  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:24:28):**  you actually embed and partner together on this. The second area that I see is really  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:24:33):**  changing is that more and more brand manufacturers like us, and it's been going on now for the  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:24:39):**  last 10 years, do understand that agriculture is a pre-competitive area actually because  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:24:44):**  we don't have dedicated supply chains by and large. We all share the landscapes in a way.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:24:50):**  And so this pre-competitive, collaboration and sustainable ag is really picked up a lot  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:24:55):**  and I see this as a positive opportunity as well because that reduces the noise for the  
**[0:25:01-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:25:01):**  farmers and gets us a bit more focused. I wanted to go back to the point you made  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:25:08):**  about being a consumer brand marketing company. Are there ever examples of requests coming  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:25:14):**  from internally that are just totally unrealistic because people don't understand agriculture?  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:25:18):**  Someone saying, oh, we should run a program to do this or what if we could market this  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:25:22):**  thing? Can we make the growers do that? Do you ever have to really bridge that divide?  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:25:26):**  Yes, yes, of course. I mean, I've lived a few of those situations and it's interesting.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:25:33):**  As a consumer company, the motto and really the strategy now to survive in the market  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:25:41):**  and to be relevant is to be fast and customized, to be agile, to be quickly turning around  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:25:46):**  things, to have a new product or variety of drink on the shelf within three months, ideally.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:25:52):**  So really be fast and really be responsive. As a consumer, you take this for granted because  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:25:57):**  you want something that you like now and of course, why not? But to make that work all  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:26:03):**  the way through the supply chain is just incredibly hard. So we had these discussions indeed about  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:26:09):**  putting new products on the shelf within speed and record time and say, well, but the fruit  
**[0:26:14-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:26:14):**  isn't grown and the fruit isn't harvested. It's not there. You have these absurd conversations  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:26:21):**  where you have between a marketing and an advertising plan and what that says and the  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:26:26):**  reality of a field, a growth and whether the juice is actually available.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:26:30):**  Yeah, of course. I mean, especially as we get more disconnected as a society from where  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:26:35):**  our food comes from, like we already see that now we want blueberries all year round and  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:26:38):**  we want apples all year round and like those things don't grow all year. So then we have  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:26:42):**  to ship them both then with people that want food miles. And so, yeah, it's quite an interesting  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:26:46):**  challenge. You mentioned some work in Australia. I'm interested because of the differences  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:26:50):**  in interventions or programs in developing countries versus more developed countries  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:26:55):**  like Australia. Do you want to tell me about that example and how you guys think about  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:26:59):**  operating differently in a more developed country?  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:27:02):**  Yeah, absolutely. So in Australia, just as context, if I look at the global map and of  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:27:07):**  our sort of engagement around sustainable agriculture projects, I have a few sort of  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:27:12):**  real hotspots because they're really interesting things and Australia is one of them. And it's  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:27:16):**  in sugar cane with sugar cane growers in Queensland. But the reason why I particularly like the  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:27:22):**  work in Australia is that it actually wasn't designed as an agricultural project as such.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:27:28):**  It was actually designed or started as a water and water replenishment and water protection  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:27:33):**  project, but through the lens of agriculture. And I think it's been one of the pilot projects  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:27:37):**  that then led globally to a number more water projects that were really targeted around  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:27:41):**  agriculture communities and farming practices to actually help alleviate sort of bigger  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:27:46):**  watershed problems and stresses. So it's been a real pioneer in that sense. It also came  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:27:51):**  with left field. So now we're talking about it as an agricultural project, but actually  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:27:54):**  it was a water project. And the other thing I really like about it is that it's been one  
**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:27:59):**  of the real sort of long term commitments and you can see what you can achieve if you  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:28:03):**  commit and you really engage over the long term. So this is now 12 years, been set up  
**[0:28:09-0:28:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:28:09):**  in 2008 with our sort of water and conservation partner WWF in Australia. And we've continued  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:28:16):**  that conversation, the conversation that the project over the years, it grew it, it grew  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:28:20):**  more stakeholders and more, of course, more farmers and growers into participating from  
**[0:28:25-0:28:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:28:25):**  19 in the beginning to 130. And the whole purpose was to work on innovative practices,  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:28:34):**  but also technologies for sugarcane growers to reduce the pesticide runoff from the fields  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:28:39):**  into the oceans and into damaging the Great Barrier Reef. That was really the core purpose.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:28:44):**  And then it developed more and more into really farming and practices innovation and to grow  
**[0:28:49-0:28:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:28:49):**  out, make the case, demonstrate it works, quantify what it really actually benefits

**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:28:58):**  You mentioned that last piece of kind of quantify and make sure it works. I'm interested in  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:29:02):**  like again, one of the kind of pushbacks or concerns is there's no scientific evidence  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:29:07):**  for this. Again, it's just greenwashing or it's something a big brand wants to say that  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:29:10):**  they're doing, but the science actually isn't solid. So tell me a little bit about that  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:29:15):**  kind of quantification verification piece.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:29:18):**  Yeah. And again, there are two angles to this. So we came to the whole water replenishment  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:29:23):**  or the whole reason starting doing such projects through the realization that of course, we  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:29:28):**  are a beverage company and we use obviously a lot of water for our production, but we  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:29:33):**  also need good quality water. So we have a global operating footprint. We're pretty much  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:29:38):**  bottling in on the ground in nearly all countries of the world and territories. So wherever  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:29:45):**  we are, we need the water, we need good quality water. And the idea was what is the goal and  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:29:51):**  vision at the time was, is there a way that we can actually give back to nature and communities  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:29:56):**  the equivalent amount of the water that we actually take for our business to sort of  
**[0:30:00-0:30:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:30:00):**  yeah, really reverse the flow and say, we invest into capturing, storing, making available,  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:30:08):**  cleaning up water that otherwise would have been lost and wasn't available for nature  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:30:12):**  and communities to the same tune. And in a way it's just a metric, right? To say we are  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:30:16):**  using X amount of water. So we're doing the same, which is sort of from a business accounting  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:30:20):**  perspective and logical metric to take. I mean, it's very ambitious because we said  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:30:24):**  global volumes, not just global, not just volumes in Australia, but globally. But that  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:30:28):**  was the starting point. And we know that we are under heightened scrutiny as co-occurring.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:30:34):**  It's not the first time that we would be criticized. And so we take a lot of care and effort to  
**[0:30:38-0:30:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:30:38):**  underpin the work with a very solid methodology. So really go scientific. It's been peer reviewed.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:30:46):**  It's been published, of course. So that is for all major types of programs or projects  
**[0:30:52-0:31:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:30:52):**  that you could generate positive volumetric water benefits with, be it a storage, a wetland,  
**[0:31:00-0:31:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:31:00):**  reforestation, soil management, irrigation technologies, all major possibilities that  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:31:07):**  we actually have in our global portfolio project. We have a methodology that specifically addresses  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:31:12):**  how do you quantify in a meaningful way the volumetric benefits. And that methodology  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:31:17):**  is now actually not only ours, not proprietary, but since last year it's now open source.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:31:22):**  So there's been a whole consortium of organizations that looked at this and looked at other methodologies  
**[0:31:29-0:31:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:31:29):**  and actually came up with a common framework for quantifying volumetric benefits. And that's  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:31:33):**  what we're transitioning into now as well. So I mean, it is really sound and we're very  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:31:38):**  transparent about how we get to those numbers and what we do getting there.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:31:43):**  A next step for Coca-Cola will be looking at how to quantify natural capital to measure  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:31:48):**  some of the other benefits, such as carbon storage, that come with certain practices.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:31:52):**  But this space is super complex and it's still only early days in terms of evidence for what  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:31:57):**  actually works.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:31:59):**  It goes both ways. I mean, if you have certain effects or impacts or uses and they are not  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:32:05):**  quantified or financially valued, then neither is a price nor is there a capital to be gotten.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:32:11):**  So the natural capital is the other side of the coin. And yeah, that applies to, in particular  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:32:17):**  now with the whole carbon and climate discussion. It's an interesting dynamic to look at this  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:32:22):**  again, because it's not a new concept, the idea of quantifying externalities or natural  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:32:27):**  capital. It's been around for some time, but it gets a new, I think, new traction now,  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:32:33):**  which is interesting. And I'd say it is a debate for both sides, right? You've got to  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:32:38):**  find a sort of a market for the impacts and for the benefits. And I currently am working  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:32:43):**  quite a lot with our business, but also with external stakeholders on looking again, particularly  
**[0:32:49-0:32:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:32:49):**  at the co-benefits, the externalities, if you like, of these replenishment projects  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:32:55):**  that we're just talking about. And that's quite a huge opportunity in those because  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:00):**  also they are nature-based solutions. And we know that nature-based solutions do yield  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:04):**  a lot of carbon sequestration benefits in general. So there's a huge opportunity to  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:09):**  get to the more natural capital positive side of the coin, which I think is a great incentive  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:14):**  if we can make it marketable, if you like, to get more investment into this area.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:20):**  I agree. There's sort of this resurgence around natural capital, that it's not a new term.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:24):**  And I think there's a bunch of people probably, yourself included, sort of sitting there going,  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:27):**  we've been talking about this for 20 years. Like, why are you guys talking about it now?  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:30):**  And why is it suddenly so sexy? But like, we've been trying to do this for decades now.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:34):**  Like what's going on? Do you have any sense of like, what's driving that?  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:39):**  Well this is wonderful saying, right? There's nothing more powerful than a good idea whose  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:43):**  time has come. And I mean, you've had this in small ways and in big ways that, you know,  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:49):**  you had an idea and you have pushed a project or a new innovation and it just wasn't, your  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:54):**  surrounding wasn't ready yet. And I think this is the same with the idea of two cost  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:58):**  or full cost accounting and natural capital. There just hasn't been the enabling environment,  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:34:04):**  including the political environment, to receive it. And now in the wake of the Paris Agreement,  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:34:10):**  in the wake of science-based climate targets, so there's actually a clear goal that has  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:34:14):**  been set that has metrics that you need to achieve. Suddenly you have in a receiving  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:34:19):**  environment. Yeah. Whenever we're failing with an idea, just remember, you know, it's  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:34:24):**  probably not the right timing yet. Just wait another few years.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:34:27):**  Yeah. I'm sure that seems easy in hindsight, but it's hard at the time when you're passionate  
**[0:34:32-0:34:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:34:32):**  about something. You mentioned a couple of times technology and innovation. Some of these  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:34:36):**  things are changing also because the technologies that can enable this to happen, whether it's  
**[0:34:40-0:34:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:34:40):**  transparency or digitizing some of these supply chain incentives or new pesticides or biological  
**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:34:47):**  solutions for growers, like that just didn't used to exist. How does technology play a  
**[0:34:50-0:34:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:34:50):**  role in some of these sustainability initiatives? Yeah, interesting. So innovation and technology  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:34:57):**  or technology being a particular form of innovation, right? It seemed to be coming across here  
**[0:35:01-0:35:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:35:01):**  as a bit of a skeptical mind, but I often also see this as the bling of innovation,  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:35:08):**  as the technologies and new gadgets, you know, and it's super exciting and it's inspiring.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:35:12):**  And I really wouldn't want to miss it because it really gives you the sort of the futuristic  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:35:17):**  feeling, but there is a tendency, and this is not unique to agriculture. It's, I think  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:35:22):**  it's general, again, human behavior that you like the shiny new objects more than the drudgery  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:35:27):**  of just the basics. But having said that, so yes, absolutely. That is something that  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:35:32):**  we are very much engaged in across all our sustainability areas. And we have been actually  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:35:38):**  on the forefront for the things that are core to our business, either product innovation  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:35:42):**  or packaging innovation, the forefront of leading and supporting new ideas and new solutions.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:35:46):**  And some of them worked and some of them didn't, and you just keep going, right? And so that's  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:35:51):**  the same with, as we're engaging in agricultural farming projects, like the ones we talked  
**[0:35:55-0:36:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:35:55):**  about Brazil or also Australia, we try to use technology and test technology in that

**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:36:07):**  do when they give them a scorecard and then directly technical assistance, or as in the  
**[0:36:11-0:36:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:36:11):**  case of Australia, you know, drones and very specific pest management and sensing technology.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:36:18):**  But I think what this also, I think, tells me generally is that innovation and technology  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:36:23):**  is dependent on the context in which it's sort of actually used. And often, depending  
**[0:36:29-0:36:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:36:29):**  on where you start, something very simple that you wouldn't identify as innovation today  
**[0:36:35-0:36:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:36:35):**  is actually super helpful and very innovative. So, for example, sugarcane smallholder farmers  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:36:41):**  in India, just had another big project there, just having a tractor or just some machinery  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:36:47):**  or some simple laser leveler that helps them to the laser level their field is such a huge  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:36:52):**  innovation, such a huge step forward. From our perspective, perhaps in Australia or Europe,  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:36:58):**  that's nothing new, obviously something new, but there it is absolutely what's needed.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:03):**  So innovation is really dependent on the context and the farming structure, of course, and  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:07):**  that's, I think, one of the lessons. But I think going back to a point you made earlier  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:11):**  as well, Sarah, innovation nowadays is a lot about psychology and behavior as well. And  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:17):**  that has to do with how do we engage? How do we reach out? How do we keep farmers on  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:23):**  the journey turning around that wheel into the positive direction to the virtuous cycle  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:28):**  and keep going at that? And I think I see not enough innovation in that sense, sort  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:32):**  of more in the psychology and the behavior change and engagement, which I think will  
**[0:37:36-0:37:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:36):**  be hugely important.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:38):**  Yeah. And I really like what you said about open source. Like it's one thing to sort of  
**[0:37:42-0:37:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:42):**  do this to convene and then it's another thing to say, and we'll share this knowledge like  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:45):**  others can do it, come access the protocol or peer reviewed science and implement it  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:50):**  yourself. I think that's kind of the next step there as well. You mentioned before sort  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:54):**  of things that didn't work or innovations that you've tried that haven't worked. Are  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:58):**  there any examples of that that come to mind? I always love technology failure stories.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:38:02):**  Let me quickly think. I like them too. They're a lot of learning, but it takes courage to  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:38:09):**  admit to them in public. Well, I guess there's one that's certainly very dynamic, generally  
**[0:38:14-0:38:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:38:14):**  very dynamic innovation area in the packaging space because that, of course, is such a huge  
**[0:38:20-0:38:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:38:20):**  issue. And there are different, again, there are different schools of thought and activities.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:38:26):**  One is about can we innovate our way out of the problem or do we have to go through the  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:38:30):**  drudgery of trying to make the circular economy work and what does this mean? On the innovation  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:38:35):**  side, of course, there are really, really impressive sort of innovations around new  
**[0:38:39-0:38:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:38:39):**  recycling technologies, which do work sometimes, but in particular, when you need the recycled  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:38:45):**  product for food grade material to put new food into it, you have to have a very, very  
**[0:38:50-0:38:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:38:50):**  high level of confidence and cleanliness and purity. Often these new technologies can't  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:38:57):**  deliver that or not yet. Again, perhaps the time hasn't come yet and it takes a little  
**[0:39:00-0:39:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:39:00):**  bit more or alternative sources of packaging, but then they fall apart or they don't hold  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:39:06):**  the oxygen or the carbon dioxide or whatever. So it's important that you have, you push  
**[0:39:11-0:39:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:39:11):**  your innovation, you find new solutions, but more often you might not actually have it  
**[0:39:16-0:39:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:39:16):**  commercialized or used for what you originally thought. There is actually perhaps a completely  
**[0:39:20-0:39:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:39:20):**  different route of what you do with it.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:39:23):**  Waste management and packaging especially is an area Coca-Cola is quite active in. But  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:39:28):**  here again, the challenges are complex and involve both behavior change and tech or science  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:39:33):**  based innovations. For example, even though we can recycle bottles right now, we of course  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:39:38):**  don't always do so. So Coke has to weigh up whether to work at the beginning of life,  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:39:43):**  such as materials that go into packaging or at the end of life, as in how we collect and  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:39:47):**  reuse what would otherwise be waste.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:39:50):**  We have coined our goals and vision as a world without waste, which we want to achieve by  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:39:56):**  2030, which means we want to go for our packaging entirely circular. That has different elements  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:40:01):**  to it. But of course, there is recycling and recycling technology collection. As you say,  
**[0:40:07-0:40:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:40:07):**  how do you engage on infrastructure for collection? How do you build that and how do you get consumers  
**[0:40:11-0:40:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:40:11):**  to actually use it as a huge chance? How do you bring it back and how do you innovate  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:40:16):**  as well and design recyclability into your packaging? We're nearly 100% recyclable in  
**[0:40:21-0:40:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:40:21):**  the packaging. How do you get recycled content back in?  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:40:24):**  But in addition to that, again, the ultimate question, are there other ways of getting  
**[0:40:28-0:40:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:40:28):**  to packaging material that is not perhaps fossil fuel-based? We've actually been active  
**[0:40:34-0:40:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:40:34):**  in that area for a long time. We launched back in 2009, so more than 10 years ago, Plant  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:40:41):**  Capital, which is basically a bio-based PET. It's still a PET in the end, but it comes  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:40:46):**  partly from bio-based material, at the time, particularly sugarcane molasses and sugarcane  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:40:51):**  products. It had a huge run in North America and in Europe and other parts of the world.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:40:57):**  But at the end of the day, the issue of waste management, so end of life, was so much more  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:41:02):**  overpowering and important for us to fix, for society to fix, than the beginning of  
**[0:41:07-0:41:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:41:07):**  life, which is the source of the packaging material. We really shifted our priorities  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:41:13):**  towards collection and recycling because that's where the real challenge is.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:41:17):**  But on the other side, you see new things like Heel Clip, which is essentially secondary  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:41:21):**  packaging. To keep a six-pack of cans together, in the classic sense, you always put a shrink  
**[0:41:27-0:41:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:41:27):**  wrap of plastics around it, just to take it off the shelf in the supermarket more easily  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:41:31):**  and put it into your trolley. And to replace that shrink wrap, this plastic wrap around  
**[0:41:37-0:41:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:41:37):**  it, with basically a paper-based or cardboard-based holder at the top, so to click those cans  
**[0:41:43-0:41:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:41:43):**  in and to basically have your hold together secondary packaging from cardboard material,  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:41:50):**  which is FSC and sustainably sourced. And that takes away some of the plastics, of course,  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:41:56):**  and it's easier recyclable. Again, for consumers, it's often easier to put a piece of that cardboard  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:42:01):**  together with your newspaper into your bag rather than think about what to do with your  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:42:05):**  shrink wrap. So it helps perhaps as well to support consumer behavior.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:42:10):**  Yeah, and taps into that psychological kind of behavior change factor too. When you think  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:42:15):**  about where we are now and some of those conversations we're having today that isn't the right time,  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:42:20):**  if we were going to do a podcast in, I don't know, 10 years, what do you think we'll be  
**[0:42:24-0:42:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:42:24):**  talking about then in terms of technology and sustainability?  
**[0:42:28-0:42:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:42:28):**  Wow, you could have briefed me on that question. I would have thought of that.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:42:33):**  It would have been way less fun. That's right. And again, I look back to look  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:42:39):**  forward very often and in the sustainability sort of profession, it's been the sort of  
**[0:42:44-0:42:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:42:44):**  saying that, so 10 years ago, in 10 or 15 years, we will have solved everything and  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:42:50):**  we'll be out of a job. That will be the objective, to be out of a job as a sustainability professional.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:42:55):**  I really believe that. I really thought, okay, particularly 2020 ironically was supposed  
**[0:43:00-0:43:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:43:00):**  to be such a sustainable year because we had so many strategies and so many targets that  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:43:04):**  would end in 2020. We were so happy. And then we're here and we see that actually the mountain

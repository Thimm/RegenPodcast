### Agtech - So What?  (2021-01-27)
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast, brought to you by the Agthente Group.  I'm Sarah Nolet. So you've just clicked on this episode about Coca-Cola and you might  be wondering, well, what does Coke have to do with Ag Tech and farming? Well, more than  you may think. For one, the Coca-Cola company happens to be the largest commercial buyer  of sugar globally. And while their high sugar drinks certainly haven't earned them any gold  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:00:27):**  stars from nutritionists, we're interested in what the company is doing in terms of innovation  and sustainable sourcing. Recently, Coke has launched multiple sustainability initiatives  focused on growing practices for ingredients and packaging. And while they don't deal directly  with farmers, the sheer scale and influence of the global company means it's inevitably  going to impact supply chains and ultimately, farming practices. I totally understand that  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:00:53):**  farmers will perceive the sustainability push as a pressure and as an additional burden.  I mean, I totally get that. But I also think that if you take a step back and you look  really at where a lot of the agricultural practices have developed over the last 50  or 60 years and where the future is, given our whole context is changing, just look at  the availability of water and look at climate change, it can't go on like this. I think  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:01:19):**  we all know that.  That's Ulrika Cepiro, the Senior Director of Global Water Stewardship and Sustainable  Agriculture at the Coca-Cola Company. Ulrika is based in Belgium, but responsible for projects  all over the world. In this episode, we talk about the increasing involvement the company  is having in agriculture, from a development program for orange growers in Brazil, to a  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:01:41):**  peer viewed production standard for sugarcane in Australia. Now, you might have some skepticism  about one of the world's most well known brands and their role in sustainability. Like, is  it just talk or even worse, like greenwashing? There certainly are marketing benefits for  Coca-Cola and Ulrika will talk about that. But there's also a shift in the way multinationals  like Coca-Cola are thinking about and influencing agriculture and sustainability all along the  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:02:07):**  supply chain. Hopefully, that's a key insight that you'll get from this conversation. But  if you disagree, be sure to let us know. So first, let's properly meet Ulrika.  You might detect a slight twang in my accent. I'm German and I grew up in Germany. I've  left 20 years ago already. So I grew up sort of in between sort of half town or urban environment  and half nature. So between what happened in the week and what happens the weekend and  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:02:33):**  the holidays was very different environments. And I think that's quite a nice metaphor as  well for what reality is now in my role, which is about this bridging of really the goals  of a multinational company and suppliers or farmers, people with completely different  and businesses with completely different interests or perspectives. And so, I wouldn't say that  I've grown up on one side or the other in this bridging sort of situation. And I think  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:02:59):**  that's a good ability to have, especially on sustainability, which is seeping really  through all aspects of business, of life, of what we need to do and where we need to  change as a society. Did you have a particular passion for farming  or agriculture growing up or how did you, like as a child or as a kid or thinking about  a career, did you want to work in food and agriculture?  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:03:21):**  No, I had no idea. Actually, my real sort of passion point, if you can call it, and  what I studied ultimately, which is sort of probably a manifestation of a certain passion  at the time, was history and politics. So I mean, really nothing to do with it. It's  more of a personal, was a personal interest. And my rural half, I'd say of my upbringing  was really more to do with forests, actually, than with farming. So we had a cabin in the  
**[0:03:45-0:03:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:03:45):**  woods and a combination of forestry and orchards, stone fruit orchards that were sort of situated  within the clearings of the forest, which for that region is a very traditional way  of fruit growing. So actually, that I only learned actually in my current role that looking  back at it to understand what the agricultural landscape was that I grew up in, I took it  for granted it was the way it was. But getting that context was really just coming back to  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:11):**  me very much later.  I love it. It's funny how those different, I guess, threads connect something that you've  done your whole life and then you didn't realize that it was a certain way or a certain lens  on it from a different vantage point. That happens a lot, I think. So tell me about your  current role.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:26):**  Right. So the last three years nearly, I have been a global lead for strategy and programs  and policy at the Coca-Cola Company for water stewardship and sustainable agriculture. So  within our sustainability team in the corporate center, I lead those two topics as a subject  matter expert. And of course, then on implementation with the functions that actually do have and  hold the relationships. So either with technical who hold the relationship with our bottling  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:04:53):**  partners or with procurement who obviously work closely with the suppliers. So on the  agricultural side in particular, I have a very close relationship with procurement and  the teams that do supply engagement.  So you mentioned a bunch of topics there around social and environmental and risk. Tell me  a little bit about how the Coca-Cola Company is thinking about sustainability and maybe  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:05:15):**  how that's changed. I feel like there's been a bit of a shift recently that it's really  hit the mainstream. It isn't sort of this niche thing off to the side that we have to  do, but I'd be curious your experience and how the company thinks about it.  So sustainability, I mean, on the highest level, the first principles is for us an opportunity  to enable growth for the business in the long term, but also to manage our risks effectively.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:05:40):**  I mean, these are the basic principles of how we look at sustainability. And that then  leads to really a look across the board of what sustainability means in the social, economic  and environmental side and how that relates to our business. We do regularly, of course,  materiality assessments for our sustainability risks. And that is evolving. There are certain  issues that come up all the time and every time you do a review, others emerge. But by  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:06:07):**  and large, as I mentioned, the issues that we're really focusing and prioritizing at  the moment are definitely around environment, world without waste, sustainable packaging  strategy, our climate policy, we have a science-based climate target, agriculture and water, which  is very closely connected. And water stewardship has been a very strong priority for the last  decades, I would say. And then human rights and community empowerment are definitely the  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:06:34):**  others on the social side, the big issues. Now, it doesn't mean that it's all we do,  but this is really where we put a lot of external internal focus and attention to. So this is  how we see it. And we have also what has perhaps shifted and is worthwhile mentioning is that  you will have heard that a lot of corporates talked about the need to define purpose for  their business. And this led to a huge discussion in the company because a lot of the discussion,  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:06:59):**  the opinions about this purpose was how do we embed what we say about sustainability  and what we do and who we are, and a bit of discussion more to the sense of why do we  need this? We've done sustainability in these different aspects for a long, long time. Why  do we need this now in a purpose? But in the end, actually, we had our leadership team  and actually our CEO directly drafting our purpose statement, which was just launched  
**[0:07:24-0:07:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:07:24):**  a year ago, actually now a year ago, and says broadly that our purpose is about refreshing  the world and making a difference. And we do that by producing love brands done sustainably  for a better shared future. It's very simple words, a few sentences, but it actually has  helped us hugely to anchor decision making and prioritization through COVID and this  whole last year to say, okay, if this is our purpose, if this is the North Star, then logically  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:07:51):**  certain decisions have to be taken in a certain way. And so I think it clarified a lot.  What's an example of that? Like, tell me how that's kind of playing out or what decisions  or an example of how that might look.  Yeah. So for example, I mean, one of the first things, of course, is about how do we react  directly to the pandemic crisis in terms of keeping our employees safe, stepping over  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:08:15):**  all the lines to work with our potlors and making sure that their employees are safe,  engaging with our suppliers as well to offer support and assistance and manage those relationships  first and foremost with an interest on safety of employees, but then very quickly shifting  towards the idea of our purpose, a better shared future. I think overall, the first  half year, half of this year, we invested about 120 million US dollars across the foundation  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:08:41):**  and the business in just community support. And that was anything from productive equipment  to sanitizing equipment, to supporting community groups, to commercial support, to small businesses  all the way to providing hygiene and hand washing facilities.  One of the comments that we get from listeners, especially when we talk to larger companies  in food and ag is sometimes like, oh, this is just marketing BS. Like they're just green  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:09:07):**  washing and they don't really care. And it's something they do on the side. It's not really  baked into who they are. And so I guess I'm curious what your response to that would be.  Yeah. And the first response is I do understand the skepticism, especially from a huge global  brand, consumer brand that you would think that way. But if that was true, then we would  have done much more marketing about it. And frankly, we haven't at all. We've done our  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:09:34):**  thing. You're transparent about it. You can look at our website and we have really clearly  listed out our actions and examples, but we haven't turned that into marketing. So actually  much to the contrary, we also stopped essentially all our external marketing spend in the first  quarter down into the second quarter of this year and reinvested a good part of that money  into that community support. One of the other things that gets talked about  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:10:01):**  is that sustainability is this sort of burden that's getting pushed on to producers or onto  farmers and especially with smallholder farmers that maybe have less capacity to respond.  But you were talking about partnerships and communities. So maybe talk a little bit about  what you're doing that's producer facing, like what's the trade off between opportunities  versus burdens and kind of how that's benefiting producers?  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:10:27):**  Yeah, that's a very good question. Of course, it's the ultimate conundrum that we face in  sustainability in particular with regards to agriculture because of course the distance  in reality or in daily operating environment between a multinational that is ultimately  using the product at the farmer who is a very different environment is just so stark, right?  So these worlds are so different. But I think that a couple of things I need to probably  
**[0:10:55-0:11:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:10:55):**  get to this question. The first is I totally understand that farmers will perceive the  sustainability push as a pressure and as an additional burden. I totally get that. But  I also think that if you take a step back and you look really at where a lot of the  agricultural practices have developed over the last 50 or 60 years and where the future  is given our whole context is changing, just look at the availability of water, look at  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:11:22):**  climate change, it can't go on like this. I think we all know that. That's the first  thing. The second thing is it actually isn't in the interest of farmers to continue operating  often in the way they do. And again, there is not one farmer. There are so many different  farm structures, so many different markets. There is not one solution, one problem. But  overall we haven't found a way to actually integrate in our thinking about finances and  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:11:46):**  economics around farming all the externalities that are being produced or impacted. And if  we were to be honest in quantifying all those impacts, we probably would have a very different  look at the productivity or the value that is generated. And only if we can do that,  I guess then we will have a different view of what sustainability practices do. So that's  just a starting point. I do understand the pressure and the feeling of burden, but I  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:12:12):**  also think we need to get over this because we know it's not going to continue like that.  The other thing I need to say about the Coca-Cola companies' particular specific role is I need  to caveat that with sort of explaining a little bit where we sit in the supply chain and how  we're organized, right? Because again, there is not one farmer, there is not one company.  Not all food and beverage manufacturers are organized the same way of what they buy and  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:12:36):**  where they buy it and how they procure it. And in our case, Coca-Cola is of course, given  the name obviously, is most associated with its main consumer brand, Coca-Cola. But we  have developed into a very diversified beverage company, right? We do not only sparkling soft  drinks, we do juice drinks, juices, we have plant-based drinks, we have coffee, we have  teas, we have dairy most recently added to the portfolio. So really a wide variety of  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:13:05):**  products. And so if we are diversifying what we sell, we obviously also diversifying what  we buy. So quite a raft of different ingredients. But I say ingredients because we don't buy  agricultural raw materials, we don't buy the commodities directly, we do buy processed  refined ingredients from processes. So we have certainly at least one if not several  intermediates in the supply chain. And we don't hold a direct relationship with farmers  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:13:33):**  by and large. Again, this is changing as the business is changing, there are shorter and  longer supply chains, but by and large, we don't have the direct relationship with the  farmers. So our lever in engaging on agriculture is through the suppliers and building the  relationship and the common understanding with the suppliers and then leverage that  to make scale at the farm level.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:13:54):**  There are two ways at least that the Coca Cola company engages with their upstream supply  chain to influence practices and outcomes on farm.  There are two tracks to it. Very practically speaking, one is given what I just said, where  we are, we work quite heavily through standards and compliance with monetary sustainability  standards, which is a way for us to get some visibility on what's happening on a farm that  
**[0:14:18-0:14:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:14:18):**  is not directly connected to our business. And secondly, through targeted and very specific  highlight lighthouse or demonstration projects at farm level where we actually work with  the suppliers to say we have an issue, we have a region, we have a commodity or a particular  ingredient, we want to engage and we want to see how we can really shift the practices  from where they are today to what is important to us, again, to manage risks, but also to  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:14:48):**  enable the growth.  Coca Cola still has a long way to go before it can say that all of its ingredients are  sustainably sourced. In their latest figures from 2019, they say that 54% of priority ingredients  were sourced sustainably. But it's a huge task when you think about how many countries  and locations they're sourcing from. Ulrika says that's part of the reason each sustainability  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:15:10):**  project looks different.  A recent example is a project in Brazil to help improve the farming practices of small  holder orange growers. They've partnered with Cutrale, Coca Cola's largest orange juice  supplier in Brazil.  We buy an awful lot of orange juice in Brazil. I mean, Brazil is the orange juice producing  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:15:27):**  market for the world. First thing. Second thing is we are a large buyer of orange juice  and have a very close relationship with Cutrale. And thirdly, the orange juice sector in Brazil  has made huge progress on sustainability and really managing their challenges. But it's  really divided into the large farms that actually can manage a lot of their challenges, including  greening and pests that are coming. And the smallholder farmers who are in a much more  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:15:52):**  precarious situation. And given that they are in a precarious situation economically  and from a productivity long term yield perspective, that also leads them to deteriorating or not  to standard practices on other things like human rights, like labor, like pest management,  etc. So whilst we know that when we work with Cutrale through their own farms or the big  farms on compliance with sustainability standards, we know that it's taken care of because they  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:16:19):**  have the capability and they are achieving really very high standards. We know that the  smallholder farmers are in a different position. That's what this project is trying to really  tackle is to say, can we work with, and in this case with 480, that's the target smallholder,  so smaller than 50 hectares of growth, orange farmers to first understand what their challenges  are, what their gap is towards achieving sustainability standards that we would accept as in line  
**[0:16:47-0:16:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:16:47):**  with our requirements and really get to the root causes of those and set up a program  supported by technology, technical assistance, I mean the whole package essentially, to get  them towards making progress in that direction, but in a way that is interesting to them.  And of course, the first way of making it interesting is to make the farm viable and  making the economics work.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:17:08):**  Yeah, the phrase that comes to mind there that I hear often in agriculture is if you're  profitable, you can consider being green, but if you're not profitable, like there's  just no kind of green sustainability on the table. You're just struggling to survive basically.  And I'm imagining a farmer listening to this and saying, these sustainability programs,  you know, great, but it's, again, it's sort of a burden on me. And so what's the incentive  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:17:31):**  for me to participate in one of these programs or to think about certifications or third  party standards or changing practices even? How do you guys think about balancing the  need for this and the genuine desire to help growers with the fact that it is, whether  financially or psychologically, difficult to actually change what they're doing?  Yeah, so I mean, I do, again, I caveat what I say that I come and look at this from a  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:17:56):**  completely different part of the supply chain of the whole chain of command that is going  on and looking at it from the outside. But there is this argument indeed that, you know,  the first it has to, the farm has to make money and then it can look into sustainability.  The more I see the evidence and particular now again, as we look into baselining or assessing  where farmers are in the beginning of such projects, you actually start to wonder, is  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:18:24):**  it that they are not economically sustainable because they're economically viable, because  they're not sustainable? Because their practices are such that actually it doesn't make sense  economically ultimately either. So give me like you give me an example. If a farm is  gotten into a position where basically it is just a monoculture and the entire landscape  is just the same rootstock and canopy of orange trees, all the same varieties, of course,  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:18:50):**  it is much more prone to capture pests in particular as the general pest level and vectors  are increasing. If you then add that the overuse of pesticides that is killing also natural  predators of pests, these are all practices that we would call sustainability practices.  But actually, at the end of the day, it is impacting your productivity because you are  much more pest prone. It increases your base costs because you use much more pesticides  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:19:18):**  and aqua chemicals. And so, it is actually the unsustainable practices that make you  not being economically viable rather than the other way around. And what we need to  try to find together is the starting point to turn a vicious cycle into a virtuous cycle  and say, what is the first thing that we can do to turn around to actually start turning  the wheel the other direction? And I guess costs and input costs and how we think holistically  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:19:44):**  about how we are using those is one of them. But it is also about basic business acumen  and skills, right? Do you know your costs? Have you understood where you are actually  spending your money? Some of those basics, if you start identifying them cleverly and  help farmers to move around, I think then you are in a different place. The challenge  is finding that point and probably incentivizing and funding the initial turnaround and adaptation  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:20:09):**  time. It is not about the long-term sustainability benefits. I think that by now is pretty much  understood. It is the sort of initial turnover time that you need of four or five years,  I suppose, depending that you need to cover. Yeah, it is fascinating. I actually did work  in my masters on transition to organic farming, looking at smallholder farmers in India growing  wheat. And what we found was this sort of exactly like you are saying, a worse before  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:20:33):**  better. And so then the interesting kind of system design principle is how do you cover  the worse before better to incentivize that transition? And it is not just the cost. Like  you could sort of say, look, here is what it will look like and here is the money. But  it is actually also about the psychology of like what if it doesn't work? What if the  worse is worse? Like I don't, this whole better part is so uncertain. It is different behaviors,  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:20:53):**  different practices. So that psychological part I think is actually almost as hard, if  not harder than the financial part in terms of that transition.  That's absolutely right. And I think it leads then to another aspect, which is such projects  usually only last three to four years, right? And then you move on to something else. But  to have actual behavior change takes so much more, just longer. So as soon as I, I often  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:21:17):**  see that as soon as the first challenge hits, farmers or anyone, I'm not making it particular  to farmers, this is a natural behavior, you reverse back to what you know, what you've  done 20 years before, just because you've done something different for two or half years,  is you know, it's not enough embedded and ingrained and you're not having the confidence.  So the other challenge is to make it go last longer. And I think there's a question about,  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:21:39):**  you know, how can you embed ongoing technical assistance, how you can embed ongoing coaching  to farmers into, you know, the legacy of a project, so that they're not just left on  their own and fight for themselves after you've decided the transition time is over.  Yeah, exactly. And I guess that it strikes me that the, you know, you guys as a company  are really at the consumer side, understanding what consumers want and where those drivers  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:22:05):**  are coming from. But as you were describing, like you don't really have control of shifting  the system necessarily, you've got incentives, and you've got connections, and you've got  a stick or a carrot, I'm sure you can wield, but it's not like you can stab your fingers  and grow something differently tomorrow, because you'd actually do the growing. So it seems  to me that there's then an incentive to sort of get closer to the producers, and whether  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:22:27):**  that's through partnerships or more vertical integration, you mentioned different kinds  of supply chains. But I'm curious, is that is my intuition there correct?  Well, certainly these projects is part of that growing, better understanding. I think  for us, it's also about growing an understanding and embedding that understanding about farmer  realities into our way of thinking, right? This is, yes, you say we are a consumer marketing  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:22:50):**  company to 99.5% of the business. So getting people to think differently about that part  by having in mind what the beginning of the supply chain in fact, in particular, is part  of that sort of just psychological mindset shift that we have to take. And so these projects  are part of that, is helping the understanding, but also giving our weight, our name, our  volume as well. I think we are buying each amount of volume into the topic and the interest  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:23:19):**  and really our commitment to sustainability and making that case. I think there is that  role that we have as well as a convener, as a promoter, as a communicator. I think I wouldn't  underestimate that. But I'd also say that I've seen an awful lot of change and positive  change in these intermediate supply chains. So certainly not the impression that I want  to make that we go now and we just jumped right to the front, let's say of the queue  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:23:45):**  and say we go speak directly to farmers. It's not our role, it's the most effective way  of doing things. I see increasingly that we've over the past years had our suppliers really  pick up on the sustainability agenda and really actually owning it and actually leading it  by themselves. And that's the right place, I think, for us to make the influence not  only stick and carry, but actually the influence and the ownership of a sustainability agenda  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:24:12):**  and having a greater understanding of the benefits within the supply chain with suppliers  to actually own it. We've seen a huge uptake and that's why partnering with suppliers like  Cutral in Brazil or of course also in Australia or on sugarcane in India is so important because  you actually embed and partner together on this. The second area that I see is really  changing is that more and more brand manufacturers like us, and it's been going on now for the  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:24:39):**  last 10 years, do understand that agriculture is a pre-competitive area actually because  we don't have dedicated supply chains by and large. We all share the landscapes in a way.  And so this pre-competitive, collaboration and sustainable ag is really picked up a lot  and I see this as a positive opportunity as well because that reduces the noise for the  farmers and gets us a bit more focused. I wanted to go back to the point you made  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:25:08):**  about being a consumer brand marketing company. Are there ever examples of requests coming  from internally that are just totally unrealistic because people don't understand agriculture?  Someone saying, oh, we should run a program to do this or what if we could market this  thing? Can we make the growers do that? Do you ever have to really bridge that divide?  Yes, yes, of course. I mean, I've lived a few of those situations and it's interesting.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:25:33):**  As a consumer company, the motto and really the strategy now to survive in the market  and to be relevant is to be fast and customized, to be agile, to be quickly turning around  things, to have a new product or variety of drink on the shelf within three months, ideally.  So really be fast and really be responsive. As a consumer, you take this for granted because  you want something that you like now and of course, why not? But to make that work all  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:26:03):**  the way through the supply chain is just incredibly hard. So we had these discussions indeed about  putting new products on the shelf within speed and record time and say, well, but the fruit  isn't grown and the fruit isn't harvested. It's not there. You have these absurd conversations  where you have between a marketing and an advertising plan and what that says and the  reality of a field, a growth and whether the juice is actually available.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:26:30):**  Yeah, of course. I mean, especially as we get more disconnected as a society from where  our food comes from, like we already see that now we want blueberries all year round and  we want apples all year round and like those things don't grow all year. So then we have  to ship them both then with people that want food miles. And so, yeah, it's quite an interesting  challenge. You mentioned some work in Australia. I'm interested because of the differences  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:26:50):**  in interventions or programs in developing countries versus more developed countries  like Australia. Do you want to tell me about that example and how you guys think about  operating differently in a more developed country?  Yeah, absolutely. So in Australia, just as context, if I look at the global map and of  our sort of engagement around sustainable agriculture projects, I have a few sort of  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:27:12):**  real hotspots because they're really interesting things and Australia is one of them. And it's  in sugar cane with sugar cane growers in Queensland. But the reason why I particularly like the  work in Australia is that it actually wasn't designed as an agricultural project as such.  It was actually designed or started as a water and water replenishment and water protection  project, but through the lens of agriculture. And I think it's been one of the pilot projects  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:27:37):**  that then led globally to a number more water projects that were really targeted around  agriculture communities and farming practices to actually help alleviate sort of bigger  watershed problems and stresses. So it's been a real pioneer in that sense. It also came  with left field. So now we're talking about it as an agricultural project, but actually  it was a water project. And the other thing I really like about it is that it's been one  
**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:27:59):**  of the real sort of long term commitments and you can see what you can achieve if you  commit and you really engage over the long term. So this is now 12 years, been set up  in 2008 with our sort of water and conservation partner WWF in Australia. And we've continued  that conversation, the conversation that the project over the years, it grew it, it grew  more stakeholders and more, of course, more farmers and growers into participating from  
**[0:28:25-0:28:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:28:25):**  19 in the beginning to 130. And the whole purpose was to work on innovative practices,  but also technologies for sugarcane growers to reduce the pesticide runoff from the fields  into the oceans and into damaging the Great Barrier Reef. That was really the core purpose.  And then it developed more and more into really farming and practices innovation and to grow  out, make the case, demonstrate it works, quantify what it really actually benefits  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:28:55):**  and then scale into more growing into areas.  You mentioned that last piece of kind of quantify and make sure it works. I'm interested in  like again, one of the kind of pushbacks or concerns is there's no scientific evidence  for this. Again, it's just greenwashing or it's something a big brand wants to say that  they're doing, but the science actually isn't solid. So tell me a little bit about that  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:29:15):**  kind of quantification verification piece.  Yeah. And again, there are two angles to this. So we came to the whole water replenishment  or the whole reason starting doing such projects through the realization that of course, we  are a beverage company and we use obviously a lot of water for our production, but we  also need good quality water. So we have a global operating footprint. We're pretty much  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:29:38):**  bottling in on the ground in nearly all countries of the world and territories. So wherever  we are, we need the water, we need good quality water. And the idea was what is the goal and  vision at the time was, is there a way that we can actually give back to nature and communities  the equivalent amount of the water that we actually take for our business to sort of  yeah, really reverse the flow and say, we invest into capturing, storing, making available,  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:30:08):**  cleaning up water that otherwise would have been lost and wasn't available for nature  and communities to the same tune. And in a way it's just a metric, right? To say we are  using X amount of water. So we're doing the same, which is sort of from a business accounting  perspective and logical metric to take. I mean, it's very ambitious because we said  global volumes, not just global, not just volumes in Australia, but globally. But that  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:30:28):**  was the starting point. And we know that we are under heightened scrutiny as co-occurring.  It's not the first time that we would be criticized. And so we take a lot of care and effort to  underpin the work with a very solid methodology. So really go scientific. It's been peer reviewed.  It's been published, of course. So that is for all major types of programs or projects  that you could generate positive volumetric water benefits with, be it a storage, a wetland,  
**[0:31:00-0:31:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:31:00):**  reforestation, soil management, irrigation technologies, all major possibilities that  we actually have in our global portfolio project. We have a methodology that specifically addresses  how do you quantify in a meaningful way the volumetric benefits. And that methodology  is now actually not only ours, not proprietary, but since last year it's now open source.  So there's been a whole consortium of organizations that looked at this and looked at other methodologies  
**[0:31:29-0:31:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:31:29):**  and actually came up with a common framework for quantifying volumetric benefits. And that's  what we're transitioning into now as well. So I mean, it is really sound and we're very  transparent about how we get to those numbers and what we do getting there.  A next step for Coca-Cola will be looking at how to quantify natural capital to measure  some of the other benefits, such as carbon storage, that come with certain practices.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:31:52):**  But this space is super complex and it's still only early days in terms of evidence for what  actually works.  It goes both ways. I mean, if you have certain effects or impacts or uses and they are not  quantified or financially valued, then neither is a price nor is there a capital to be gotten.  So the natural capital is the other side of the coin. And yeah, that applies to, in particular  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:32:17):**  now with the whole carbon and climate discussion. It's an interesting dynamic to look at this  again, because it's not a new concept, the idea of quantifying externalities or natural  capital. It's been around for some time, but it gets a new, I think, new traction now,  which is interesting. And I'd say it is a debate for both sides, right? You've got to  find a sort of a market for the impacts and for the benefits. And I currently am working  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:32:43):**  quite a lot with our business, but also with external stakeholders on looking again, particularly  at the co-benefits, the externalities, if you like, of these replenishment projects  that we're just talking about. And that's quite a huge opportunity in those because  also they are nature-based solutions. And we know that nature-based solutions do yield  a lot of carbon sequestration benefits in general. So there's a huge opportunity to  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:09):**  get to the more natural capital positive side of the coin, which I think is a great incentive  if we can make it marketable, if you like, to get more investment into this area.  I agree. There's sort of this resurgence around natural capital, that it's not a new term.  And I think there's a bunch of people probably, yourself included, sort of sitting there going,  we've been talking about this for 20 years. Like, why are you guys talking about it now?  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:30):**  And why is it suddenly so sexy? But like, we've been trying to do this for decades now.  Like what's going on? Do you have any sense of like, what's driving that?  Well this is wonderful saying, right? There's nothing more powerful than a good idea whose  time has come. And I mean, you've had this in small ways and in big ways that, you know,  you had an idea and you have pushed a project or a new innovation and it just wasn't, your  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:33:54):**  surrounding wasn't ready yet. And I think this is the same with the idea of two cost  or full cost accounting and natural capital. There just hasn't been the enabling environment,  including the political environment, to receive it. And now in the wake of the Paris Agreement,  in the wake of science-based climate targets, so there's actually a clear goal that has  been set that has metrics that you need to achieve. Suddenly you have in a receiving  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:34:19):**  environment. Yeah. Whenever we're failing with an idea, just remember, you know, it's  probably not the right timing yet. Just wait another few years.  Yeah. I'm sure that seems easy in hindsight, but it's hard at the time when you're passionate  about something. You mentioned a couple of times technology and innovation. Some of these  things are changing also because the technologies that can enable this to happen, whether it's  
**[0:34:40-0:34:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:34:40):**  transparency or digitizing some of these supply chain incentives or new pesticides or biological  solutions for growers, like that just didn't used to exist. How does technology play a  role in some of these sustainability initiatives? Yeah, interesting. So innovation and technology  or technology being a particular form of innovation, right? It seemed to be coming across here  as a bit of a skeptical mind, but I often also see this as the bling of innovation,  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:35:08):**  as the technologies and new gadgets, you know, and it's super exciting and it's inspiring.  And I really wouldn't want to miss it because it really gives you the sort of the futuristic  feeling, but there is a tendency, and this is not unique to agriculture. It's, I think  it's general, again, human behavior that you like the shiny new objects more than the drudgery  of just the basics. But having said that, so yes, absolutely. That is something that  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:35:32):**  we are very much engaged in across all our sustainability areas. And we have been actually  on the forefront for the things that are core to our business, either product innovation  or packaging innovation, the forefront of leading and supporting new ideas and new solutions.  And some of them worked and some of them didn't, and you just keep going, right? And so that's  the same with, as we're engaging in agricultural farming projects, like the ones we talked  
**[0:35:55-0:36:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:35:55):**  about Brazil or also Australia, we try to use technology and test technology in that  local context as much as possible, be it applications to engage farmers and to baseline what they  do when they give them a scorecard and then directly technical assistance, or as in the  case of Australia, you know, drones and very specific pest management and sensing technology.  But I think what this also, I think, tells me generally is that innovation and technology  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:36:23):**  is dependent on the context in which it's sort of actually used. And often, depending  on where you start, something very simple that you wouldn't identify as innovation today  is actually super helpful and very innovative. So, for example, sugarcane smallholder farmers  in India, just had another big project there, just having a tractor or just some machinery  or some simple laser leveler that helps them to the laser level their field is such a huge  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:36:52):**  innovation, such a huge step forward. From our perspective, perhaps in Australia or Europe,  that's nothing new, obviously something new, but there it is absolutely what's needed.  So innovation is really dependent on the context and the farming structure, of course, and  that's, I think, one of the lessons. But I think going back to a point you made earlier  as well, Sarah, innovation nowadays is a lot about psychology and behavior as well. And  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:17):**  that has to do with how do we engage? How do we reach out? How do we keep farmers on  the journey turning around that wheel into the positive direction to the virtuous cycle  and keep going at that? And I think I see not enough innovation in that sense, sort  of more in the psychology and the behavior change and engagement, which I think will  be hugely important.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:38):**  Yeah. And I really like what you said about open source. Like it's one thing to sort of  do this to convene and then it's another thing to say, and we'll share this knowledge like  others can do it, come access the protocol or peer reviewed science and implement it  yourself. I think that's kind of the next step there as well. You mentioned before sort  of things that didn't work or innovations that you've tried that haven't worked. Are  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:37:58):**  there any examples of that that come to mind? I always love technology failure stories.  Let me quickly think. I like them too. They're a lot of learning, but it takes courage to  admit to them in public. Well, I guess there's one that's certainly very dynamic, generally  very dynamic innovation area in the packaging space because that, of course, is such a huge  issue. And there are different, again, there are different schools of thought and activities.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:38:26):**  One is about can we innovate our way out of the problem or do we have to go through the  drudgery of trying to make the circular economy work and what does this mean? On the innovation  side, of course, there are really, really impressive sort of innovations around new  recycling technologies, which do work sometimes, but in particular, when you need the recycled  product for food grade material to put new food into it, you have to have a very, very  
**[0:38:50-0:38:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:38:50):**  high level of confidence and cleanliness and purity. Often these new technologies can't  deliver that or not yet. Again, perhaps the time hasn't come yet and it takes a little  bit more or alternative sources of packaging, but then they fall apart or they don't hold  the oxygen or the carbon dioxide or whatever. So it's important that you have, you push  your innovation, you find new solutions, but more often you might not actually have it  
**[0:39:16-0:39:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:39:16):**  commercialized or used for what you originally thought. There is actually perhaps a completely  different route of what you do with it.  Waste management and packaging especially is an area Coca-Cola is quite active in. But  here again, the challenges are complex and involve both behavior change and tech or science  based innovations. For example, even though we can recycle bottles right now, we of course  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:39:38):**  don't always do so. So Coke has to weigh up whether to work at the beginning of life,  such as materials that go into packaging or at the end of life, as in how we collect and  reuse what would otherwise be waste.  We have coined our goals and vision as a world without waste, which we want to achieve by  2030, which means we want to go for our packaging entirely circular. That has different elements  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:40:01):**  to it. But of course, there is recycling and recycling technology collection. As you say,  how do you engage on infrastructure for collection? How do you build that and how do you get consumers  to actually use it as a huge chance? How do you bring it back and how do you innovate  as well and design recyclability into your packaging? We're nearly 100% recyclable in  the packaging. How do you get recycled content back in?  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:40:24):**  But in addition to that, again, the ultimate question, are there other ways of getting  to packaging material that is not perhaps fossil fuel-based? We've actually been active  in that area for a long time. We launched back in 2009, so more than 10 years ago, Plant  Capital, which is basically a bio-based PET. It's still a PET in the end, but it comes  partly from bio-based material, at the time, particularly sugarcane molasses and sugarcane  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:40:51):**  products. It had a huge run in North America and in Europe and other parts of the world.  But at the end of the day, the issue of waste management, so end of life, was so much more  overpowering and important for us to fix, for society to fix, than the beginning of  life, which is the source of the packaging material. We really shifted our priorities  towards collection and recycling because that's where the real challenge is.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:41:17):**  But on the other side, you see new things like Heel Clip, which is essentially secondary  packaging. To keep a six-pack of cans together, in the classic sense, you always put a shrink  wrap of plastics around it, just to take it off the shelf in the supermarket more easily  and put it into your trolley. And to replace that shrink wrap, this plastic wrap around  it, with basically a paper-based or cardboard-based holder at the top, so to click those cans  
**[0:41:43-0:41:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:41:43):**  in and to basically have your hold together secondary packaging from cardboard material,  which is FSC and sustainably sourced. And that takes away some of the plastics, of course,  and it's easier recyclable. Again, for consumers, it's often easier to put a piece of that cardboard  together with your newspaper into your bag rather than think about what to do with your  shrink wrap. So it helps perhaps as well to support consumer behavior.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:42:10):**  Yeah, and taps into that psychological kind of behavior change factor too. When you think  about where we are now and some of those conversations we're having today that isn't the right time,  if we were going to do a podcast in, I don't know, 10 years, what do you think we'll be  talking about then in terms of technology and sustainability?  Wow, you could have briefed me on that question. I would have thought of that.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:42:33):**  It would have been way less fun. That's right. And again, I look back to look  forward very often and in the sustainability sort of profession, it's been the sort of  saying that, so 10 years ago, in 10 or 15 years, we will have solved everything and  we'll be out of a job. That will be the objective, to be out of a job as a sustainability professional.  I really believe that. I really thought, okay, particularly 2020 ironically was supposed  
**[0:43:00-0:43:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:43:00):**  to be such a sustainable year because we had so many strategies and so many targets that  would end in 2020. We were so happy. And then we're here and we see that actually the mountain  we have to climb is even higher. And looking at 2030 as a pivotal year for sustainable  development goals, for the Paris Agreement, for fixing the climate or at least slowing  climate change, what we need to be talking about is how we actually made sustainability  
**[0:43:25-0:43:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/1/26-coca-cola-and-our-food-system#t=0:43:25):**  a core economic and financial language of currency in economic speak and in our, not  only in the corporate environment and how we actually as companies measure our success,  but also as a society is to find a way to integrate sustainability impacts into how  we account for our value as a company and for our GDP and success as a society. That  I think is for me the biggest innovation that we can do right now.

### Agtech - So What?  (2019-12-18)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:00:22):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. I'm joined today by Stuart Austin, general  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:00:42):**  manager of the Wilmette Cattle Company, a regenerative farming operation with three  properties in the New England area of New South Wales, Australia. I actually met Stuart  at a pub for a work event, and within about five minutes, I knew I wanted to have him  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:00:56):**  on as a guest. In this episode, Stuart shares how he and his wife Trish got involved in  regenerative ag, how the stigma against regen ag is starting to change, and some of the  tools that Stuart is using to make six and seven figure decisions around stocking rates  
**[0:01:12-0:01:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:01:12):**  and carrying capacity. Stuart starts by explaining how he and Trish ended up at Wilmette.  I actually grew up around Albury in southern New South Wales. Trish grew up in central  West Queensland, and we met in the Northern Territory 15 years ago. Both of us were separate  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:01:28):**  ways, and then I was back up there. I was managing a property up there, and Trish was  working for the Department of Ag for about 10 years. We've been working on stations in  the past in the industry up there, and for the last couple of years up there, we were  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:01:41):**  just contracting. We just started to look beyond the NT for opportunities in holistic  management, I suppose. Al had this job advertised, and we didn't even know where Ebor was. Just  the way the ad was worded, it sounded really encouraging talking about low stress stock  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:01:59):**  handling and holistic management and rotational grazing, all the things that we were interested  in. We applied quite out of the blue, and by the time we flew down here and had a look  around, we couldn't wait to get on board. Thankfully, we were off the job, and we haven't  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:02:14):**  looked back. How did you get interested in holistic management?  My grandfather had a property, and he was just a fairly conventional farmer doing what  he knew and acting on the advice he was given at the time, which was typically fairly departmental.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:02:32):**  When I was about probably 22 or 23, I suppose I went to a low stress stock handling school.  Through that, the people that were involved in that had been involved in holistic management  through RCS from Rockhampton and talked a lot about the Gazing for Profit school. My  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:02:52):**  brother-in-law and his family had been right through Gazing for Profit and Executive Link  and all the RCS teachings. I started to spend a bit of time with them in North Queensland  on their properties, and I just really recognised how calm their business was, how low stress  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:03:10):**  it was, their whole business. Their family was very happy. They were quite financially  secure. It wasn't because they had the best place, the best soil in the country, or they  inherited everything. They clearly had a very robust business financially and ecologically.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:03:28):**  So they became that family, I suppose, became real mentors to us. Through that, we started  to expand our network in that circle. I'm really curious to know more about that.  What's an example of that calmness and that success of that business? It sounds so appealing,  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:03:45):**  but it's also hard to imagine. Is it like they walked around slower, like the grass  looked better?  Kind of in a way, having worked quite a bit across the North, in a lot of places, it's  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:03:57):**  a real numbers game. It's as hard and as fast as you can put them through. It's a turnover  business. These guys, I went mustering there for them, contract mustering. I don't know  what it would have been probably 15 years ago after I'd been up North for a few years.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:04:14):**  We went mustering, there's a helicopter there. They put some cattle together for us and cows  were coming in calm, calves on them. Everyone was pretty relaxed. We just picked them up,  a few dogs, a few people and a fair-sized one with cows. In a way, we'd go and walk  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:04:30):**  to the yards. Cutting cows and calves out was easy. Cattle were in a good frame of mind.  I was there for, I don't know, I suppose probably a month or six weeks. Through that whole time,  we got a lot done, but there was no stress. Everything just seemed to roll along quite  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:04:51):**  smoothly.  It was after this experience that Stuart decided to learn more about holistic management. He  decided to take the grazing for profit course himself.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:05:00):**  It's a foundation, I suppose, for anyone who's interested in this system of management. We'd  known about it for a long time, but we didn't want to do it until we were in a position  to be able to implement what we'd learned at the school, which was about the timing.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:05:15):**  It worked out pretty well. We're now part of an executive link board and we've hosted  RCS days here, workshops and courses and so forth. We're a real proponent for everything  they teach because I've just seen so many examples of people who have undertaken their  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:05:31):**  training and their agricultural businesses are financially robust. People are happy.  There's some really good succession stories have come through those guys. I just think  they're focused on some really key fundamentals about our businesses.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:05:50):**  It sounds like, I mean, my personal journey was into ag through a largely regenerative  system and mindset and people who were doing that. I feel like I'm fully bought in, but  there's so much still controversy around it and holistic management, but regenerative  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:06:04):**  especially. It feels like there's a bit of a tipping point where it's less kind of seen  as hippy dippy, but it's still for a long time been seen as this alternative hippy non-commercial  type of practice. Tell me about your experience with either how things are changing or that  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:06:18):**  kind of perception. Is that something that you face?  Absolutely. If I go back to that family to North Queensland, for a long time, they will  tell you that anyone who'd done RCS or graduate profit, it was a cult and it was really weird  
**[0:06:34-0:06:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:06:34):**  shit that everyone was doing. It was very much people were outsiders, I guess. In the  last, I don't know how long, probably five years, I suppose the tides really started  to turn. One of the things I say a lot is that one of the greatest catalyst for change  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:06:51):**  is pain. At the moment, there's a lot of pain in agricultural businesses, by and large driven  by the weather, something well and totally beyond our control. I think we're seeing more  and more examples of positive stories coming out of farm businesses or agricultural businesses  
**[0:07:09-0:07:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:07:09):**  that are managing regeneratively. They're starting to prove that this isn't some weird  cult or kooky sort of witchcraft. What we do is nothing revolutionary. It's just simplifying  things and going back to some really old ways of being and doing that focus on the fundamental  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:07:32):**  things of making money and looking after our ecology and making sure people are happy.  Now that Stuart has seen the benefits of these practices, he started to share them with others.  He's seeing that some of the negative perceptions are starting to change.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:07:46):**  I think one of the most encouraging things we've seen or I've personally seen, I suppose,  we had a field day here in February this year and we had nearly 300 people turn up. It took  a while for that to sink in. There was a couple of people afterwards told me that was the  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:07:59):**  best field I've ever been to. It took a little while for me to sink in afterwards. I've  been to a lot of field days. I've never been to one on a farm with a lot of people.  The whole premise of the day was around education and helping people with decision making and  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:12):**  thinking differently and thinking about things the way we think about things here. We had  examples through the day of other people who do things the way we do things. In a non-confrontational  way, not trying to jam it down in one stroke, but show that there is another way of thinking  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:30):**  and way of doing things that may mean that you're more profitable and that your land  is healthier and that you are happier.  Help me bring that to life in terms of one of the examples you might have used at the  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:40):**  field day or something you guys do that's seen as quite different but is effective.  There's probably two things come to mind. One would be we talk about managing our stocking  rate to our carrying capacity dynamically. It's constantly changing. That's quite an  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:54):**  area for a lot of people, particularly people who traditionally run a breeding enterprise  where the last resort is to have to sell their breeding stock. At Wilmot, we run a trading  enterprise. To me, cattle are a tool that we use to number one, make money and number  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:09:10):**  two, heal the landscape. I have no trouble in buying and selling cattle and we do it  all the time, week to week, month to month. There's always cattle coming or going from  here as and when our grass determines we need to adjust our stocking rate.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:09:22):**  We also have a breeding enterprise at Walca on our property down there. That is a much  harder decision for us to make but it's one that we know we have to make. We've gone from  800 cows there in June last year to about 250 left there now. As our grass is determined,  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:09:44):**  we just kept selling down cows. It is a harder decision to make but once you overcome that  paradigm that they're irreplaceable and recognise that your country will be grateful for you  having made that decision and so will your bank account, it becomes easier to do. That's  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:10:00):**  one thing. The other thing probably that comes to mind that is quite different and takes  a bit of coming to terms with is small numbers of large mobs. We run mobs of up to 1500 head  of cattle here, 20 hectare paddock and often they're moved. This time of year, we're moving  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:10:17):**  almost daily. Some places are more intensive than us. We're moving three or four or five  times a day. That's quite a hard thing for a lot of people to fathom. It seems like a  lot of work but in fact, it's a lot less work. It's very enjoyable. Fundamentally, the biggest  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:10:35):**  thing that does for us is increase our density which changes our landscape so much quicker.  We've got people in the district still ask us if we still run those big mobs and do all  that other funny stuff. I say, yes, we do. Everyone always says we've got so much grass  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:10:51):**  here. Why do you have so much grass? You must have enough cattle.  It's so interesting. The story you hear in the regenerative ag space is the Alan Savory  classic like, look at this property and the fence and the other property and this one's  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:11:05):**  been managed holistically and look how much greener and nicer it is versus that one but  you guys are actually living that. I think you mentioned that with the fires that that's  actually had maybe an adverse effect. I don't know if you want to tell that story but it  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:11:20):**  always brings it to life when it's not a picture but it's someone living it and you actually  go see that farm next to the other one and can really see how different it truly is.  Yes, for sure. We do see that every day. The first thing that comes to mind is I wish I  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:11:35):**  could help that person on the other side of the fence. One of the things I've always said  is one of the biggest barriers to change is the human ego. That's why we do what we do  here in terms of the workshops and the courses and the field days is to try and open the  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:11:53):**  door and show people what we do and why we do it and perhaps this might help them. We  see that fence line effect every day and we don't think we're better than anyone else.  We just I suppose we like to think that our land is a bit healthier. Definitely one of  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:12:06):**  the flip sides to that was in early September when we had a bushfire come through here and  we had more grass than most of our neighbors and meant we lost a lot of country and grass  that we had stockpiled I suppose for a few months. We had plenty of feed in front of  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:12:24):**  us and that was taken away in a matter of hours. The fire then burned out as it went  into our neighbors where there wasn't grass to burn. That was a bit of an irony and quite  heartbreaking and certainly there were some tough decisions to make around our stocking  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:12:39):**  rate and our canicabustia because we basically just had the amount of grass we had halved  so we needed to halve our stocking rate overnight which is effectively what we did the next  week. Again, not a lazy decision to make but one we nearly had to make.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:12:56):**  Tell me a bit about the Wilmette brand. How does that work? We talked a little bit about  this before but are you direct to consumer? Is it branded as grass fed? How does the downstream  supply chain work? I guess one of the reasons I ask is often there's a balance between doing  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:13:11):**  regenerative practices because that's what will be more profitable and keep the family  and team sane versus it unlocks some premium for consumers. Tell me a little bit about  how downstream works for you guys and how you think about regenerative in terms of premiums  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:13:25):**  and consumers.  Sure. We don't have our own brand presently. We have had in the past and we've learned  a lot of things around that. It was actually just before I got here. It was somewhat small  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:13:39):**  scale and being marketed domestically and the scale we can't issue that we needed more  scale so we increased that and learned a few more lessons. We then did a lot of due diligence  sort of last year around I guess a full scale supply chain into the US marketing a grass  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:13:58):**  fed beef product and in the end decided that the capital required and that the risk associated  with that was really a bit too large for what we were comfortable with at this stage. That's  our long-term goal or vision. It's to be rewarded for the land management that we undertake  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:14:22):**  through the beef that we sell. I think it's still a little bit way off. There are some  people who are doing it really well but it is also a very small portion of their business.  Even when we were there was 12 months where we were supplying quite a significant volume  
**[0:14:38-0:14:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:14:38):**  monthly and even then it was probably only 10% of our turnover. It sort of finishes the  story I guess for us. That's the reason why we're still at the bottom of our heart as  something we'd like to do in the long term. Everything we do is geared around the health  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:14:56):**  of our soil, the health of our ecosystem, the health of our animals, the health of our  people and our bank account. Being able to put that story on a box and say that this  is the healthiest beef you can buy because of the life it's had, that's ultimately the  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:15:12):**  story we'd like to tell. There are absolutely some production challenges associated with  that and with the typical marketing environment where a consumer wants that product month  in, month out in such a variable climate that we live in that's proving quite challenging  
**[0:15:29-0:15:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:15:29):**  to meet. It's been a demise I'd say probably 95% of the brands that have failed have been  inability to supply in tough times. It's something we haven't yet overcome but perhaps one day  we will.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:15:46):**  Yeah. Do you ever get into local debates or maybe not local around grass fed beef and  holistically managed livestock versus plant-based protein versus cellular agriculture like that  beef is the evil environmental degrading force and we can't produce cows but no, I'm doing  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:16:08):**  it healthy. Do you ever find yourself in the middle of that debate or any examples of having  to defend beef in that sense?  I think I'm mellowing with age. I am quite active on social media, mostly on Facebook  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:16:20):**  and have been known to engage in some fairly heated conversations on there but always try  to be respectful and look at both sides of the story. I haven't been so much of late  but certainly have learned a lot about both sides of the story and one of the interesting  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:16:37):**  things I really found about plant-based meat is that 95% of the people that are eating  plant-based meats are in fact meat-itarians not vegetarians and they are discontented  with the production system, the conventional production system of their beef and they're  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:16:55):**  looking for it's sort of I guess a silent protest in terms of they still want to eat  beef and they still love the taste and the smell of everything and everything that goes  with it but they don't agree with the supply chain and that's something that we need to  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:17:08):**  get better at doing and telling I think.  Yeah, it's such a challenge. We're in marketing now so similar all the time like everything  looks like it's natural and healthy and good for you and like non-GMO and all these terms  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:17:26):**  that don't mean anything and aren't regulated. It's just so hard to tell a story that's authentic  when especially decisions are made in one second by someone who's busy and thinking  about price mostly.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:17:36):**  For sure and it's such a, I mean I don't know how we overcome that. I guess someone asked  me the other day how do we educate the masses about what we do and I just said you've got  to open the gate. Basically we invite them in here, front gates open all the time to  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:17:52):**  come and see how we produce our beef and what we do and how we do it and show them that  the way we produce our beef is good for the environment. We ask sequestering carbon and  we're actually about to do a carbon audit here and quite confident that we are carbon  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:05):**  negative in our production system but how do we get that message all the way to the  consumer in Sydney? From little old Ebor, here's a challenge and we can preach that  what we do is the best thing but if we can't supply a product every day of the week on  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:19):**  a shelf in the supermarket then it's still not good enough.  Tell me about the carbon audit, like why did you decide to do that and especially like  on the technology side often one of the big challenges with that kind of thing is just  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:32):**  how cost effective it largely isn't to do that kind of work. So how are you thinking  about that process?  So we have been, I guess it started with our soil testing and since 2012 we've been soil  
**[0:18:45-0:18:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:45):**  testing here about nine different sites across the farm and we do it in about May every year  and each year we look at all our macro and micro minerals across our soil and one of  the things we focus a lot on is carbon and we have seen at shovel depth on those same  
**[0:19:04-0:19:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:19:04):**  transects over the last seven years an increase in soil carbon from a base of about 2.3% to  a peak in 2017 of nearly over 5% and we're sort of back hovering around 4.5%, 4.7% soil  organic carbon which is a dramatic increase and one of the biggest things that's done  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:19:28):**  that has been the intensity of our grazing and that was the real thing that changed that  saw us increase in soil organic carbon. So we've done all kinds of sums around that and  we've shared this information fairly widely around the world with some different organisations  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:19:42):**  trying to look at ways that we can be rewarded for that in terms of the whole Emission Reduction  Scheme, carbon farming, all these different things that are talked about but no one is  quite crack and neither are we. So carbon audit the other day talking about whether  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:19:58):**  we could sell a carbon negative beef product came up and we have had an audit done here  a few years ago and I can't remember exactly, we may have been slightly carbon positive  at that point but we're now fairly confident that we would be carbon negative. So can we  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:20:16):**  then develop a brand and write a story around that? Whether or not we'll be monetised for  that still remains to be seen. We work with a consulting company in Arbida Island, we've  got a guy there who's leaving no stone unturned trying to find ways that we can be remunerated  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:20:30):**  for what we're doing here. Nevertheless it's something that we continue to focus on every  day in our system and our long term goal is to try and get our soil carbon back to about  6% which from a CSIRO report from 1960 that's about where we were. So hopefully one day  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:20:48):**  we can monetise those gains.  One of the ways that Stuart has been able to implement some of these regen practices  is through the use of technology. Not only do they use tech but they've actually been  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:21:00):**  involved in the development of some tech solutions when they couldn't find anything available  on the market.  We like to think of ourselves as fairly technically advanced I suppose and an earlier doctor of  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:21:13):**  new technology and we use it fundamentally to make decisions, capturing data and then  making decisions from that data. So my engraving was developed four or five years ago on the  back of Wilmot basically. The manager who was here prior to me, he was the one that  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:21:32):**  started the rotational grazing and increasing the intensity here, was using paper grazing  charts and what he was achieving was clearly evident in the paddock and talked a lot about  grazing charts but upper management couldn't see that.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:21:46):**  So Bart Davidson in all his wisdom said he'd always had a dream about making that an online  development system for planning and forecasting and recording etc. So Mya began and Wilmot  has, was and still is the guinea pig for Mya. We use it every day in our management here  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:22:07):**  basically to graze plans. We're constantly out in the paddock feed budgeting looking  ahead of ourselves and seeing how much we're in volume, how much we're grazing in each  graze and how much we've got in front of us to be able to graze, how many days grazing  
**[0:22:24-0:22:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:22:24):**  in front we have. We're coming back and plugging that into a grazing plan and then we can extend  that out into a three and six and 12 month forecast and then we can start to make decisions  around our stocking rate which then influences our turnover, which influences our bottom  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:22:42):**  line. So when I go to write our budget every year the first thing I do is go out in the  paddock and take stock of our grass inventory and then I start to forecast in Mya what I  think our rainfall will be and how many cattle I think we can graze through each month of  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:22:59):**  the year and I then start plugging that back into the budget as to how many cattle we need  to buy and how many we need to sell and then that ultimately determines what our bottom  line is going to look like for the year. But we're constantly re-budgeting I suppose or  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:23:12):**  re-forecasting every month. That changes as our own for whether we get more or less than  what we forecast we're then adjusting that forecast stocking rate. So it's a very powerful  tool. I say that I make $100,000 decisions with it probably weekly if not million dollar  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:23:30):**  decisions with it. So the cost of it is incidental really. I don't even notice it coming out  of the bank account for the value of the decisions that we make with it.  What was it like to be the pilot slash part of the development? That can be one of the  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:23:45):**  things in ag tech that's often talked about is like I want to be the fast follower so  that I don't have to go through the pain of having it work for a while. I just want it  to work. What was that like?  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:23:55):**  It was good fun and we still have fun with it. One of the things I really enjoy is business  development and while this isn't necessarily business development we were certainly involved  in product development. So we road tested a lot of things but it also gave us an opportunity  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:24:09):**  to give a lot of constructive feedback to say this is working really well for us. This  is something we think you need to change. This is one of our frustrations. I had Bart  on speed dial there for a while in terms of support issues but I think one of their greatest  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:24:25):**  strengths is their support team. Trish in fact before she went on maternity leave was  their support team leader and there's four or five girls now in the support team and  all of them use the product at home. I think that's really valuable to Mya when people  
**[0:24:41-0:24:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:24:41):**  ring up with issues. People like me who are graziers and we just want it to work and the  girls all understand our frustrations I suppose but they're very proactive in fixing things  and creating a program that's really user friendly for people like us. So it's been  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:25:00):**  really good fun and it's exciting. We actually have the whole Mya crew come up here each  year and they have a little corporate love in up here and that's a great opportunity  for us to get them in the paddock and show them how we use it in the paddock and how  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:25:13):**  it's working or not working for us and again give them some constructive feedback as to  how we think it could work better. So yeah I would say it's been good fun.  Yeah right so when the next tech product comes knocking saying hey do you want to be a pilot  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:25:28):**  user slash help me co-develop this are you gonna say yes?  For sure. We're always looking for things that we can integrate into the system here.  I believe Stuart when he says that he'll say yes. He has a lot of examples of different  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:25:43):**  tech that he's using, trialing or helping to develop.  We've also sort of other guinea pig or I suppose with a pilot for farm bot and Mya's integration.  We've now got a farm bot rain gauge here that is pushing information straight into Mya,  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:26:01):**  rainfall information straight into Mya. So that's terrific.  Stuart also has a bit of a wish list for some ag tech that he wants but hasn't found.  And the one that I really want that I've been asking you know in a few different places  
**[0:26:14-0:26:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:26:14):**  for is a soil probe under a rain gauge so that we can start to look pretty closely at  our infiltration levels of every time we get rain how much are we infiltrating and how  versus how much is running off and also how much are we retaining in our soil and for  
**[0:26:34-0:26:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:26:34):**  how long because if our soil health is improving as we think it is and as a soil test is suggesting  we should be a water retention should improve and infiltration should improve but the only  way to really test that is how much rain do we get versus how much do we retain and the  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:26:50):**  soil probe is what I need to be able to do that. So if there's anyone who's got a thinks  they have a product that could do that I'm very keen to hear about it.  Great. We'll get the word out.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:27:01):**  One thing that struck me during my conversation with Stuart like many of the producers who  come on the podcast was that he's so open about what they do and how they do it. Given  transparency is such a buzzword in agriculture right now and consumer mistrust feels like  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:27:21):**  it's at an all time high. I wanted to ask Stuart why is he so open?  We're just quite open about sharing our story. We don't profess to know it all or have all  the answers but we're all keen to help other people and that comes right from Al who owns  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:27:36):**  the place and it's the reason that we host the field and it's on again in 2020 27th of  February at Wilmot and we've got a cracking lineup of speakers. And again the day won't  necessarily be about Wilmot but it'll be about bringing people to the farm to share their  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:27:54):**  knowledge to help other people because we're all in this together and plenty of my friends  are in just as much pain as anyone else and if I could help anyone I'd love to be able  to help them. So like I say if anyone's got any questions about anything we do we're always  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:28:13):**  willing to share.  I guess there's pretty different views on this openness question and I find it fascinating  that some people are like I'm oversimplifying but on one side of the spectrum it's just  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:28:27):**  trust us where we care about the land and the animals, let us do what we do best and  get on with being a consumer and on the other end it's like come have a look anytime, learn  more, like ask us questions, we're super open which I find so fascinating like there's such  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:28:42):**  different answers in the same industry and even some people doing the same kinds of practices.  I don't know if you have any thoughts on that but it always strikes me as both yeah just  just such a stark difference in the industry.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:28:56):**  Yes that is a really good question Sarah and I sort of struggle to think of it from the  other perspective of just trust us because I guess if that was someone telling that to  me I'd be asking what they've got to hide, what are you scared of us saying, what are  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:16):**  you worried about and if we hold hardly can you know put a hand in our heart and say that  we're doing the very best we can by animals and our land then we should be willing to  open the door because without a customer we don't have a market, without a market we might  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:32):**  as well not be producing the product that we're producing so like any business our customer  is always right.  To close out my chat with Stuart I wanted to try something new.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:41):**  I attempted to ask him a couple of rapid-fire questions.  So first one, do your kids want to be involved in farming?  Yes Harry's nearly five and I can rarely leave the house without him what he'd become.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:56):**  I love it very cool.  What's your most proud farm moment?  It could be from this year in your past.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:30:03):**  Oh that's a big question I'd say the field day would take some topping.  Yeah that was quite a special day I guess and like I said it took a few months to sort  of come to terms with the fact that that many people have turned up to come and see and  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:30:23):**  hear what we had to say.  Another little highlight this year was being awarded the Young Carbon Farmer of the Year  award in August.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:30:33):**  It was completely unexpected and quite kind recognition of what we've been trying to do  here.  Is there a book or movie that's been influential in your life that others should check out?  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:30:47):**  There was a book actually I read this a long time ago but it had a profound impact on my  life it was called You Inc written by John McGraw from McGraw Real Estates and I read  it I don't know 16 years ago and that book certainly changed my life in terms of my attitude  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:31:08):**  and outlook to life and probably my personality.  And a movie that I have watched well again when I was younger this would be a bit of  a throwback but remember the Titans was a fairly influential movie.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:31:24):**  There's a little sign on the wall in that movie that says attitude reflects leadership  I've never forgotten that there's a lot of hidden messages in that movie that are worth  trying to take home.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:31:38):**  That's really awesome thank you so much for making the time this was a good chat for sure  I enjoyed it.  For sure it was great thank you very much for having me on the podcast.

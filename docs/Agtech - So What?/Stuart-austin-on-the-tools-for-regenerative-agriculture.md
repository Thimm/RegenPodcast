### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 18:46:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:00:12):**  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:00:17):**  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:00:22):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:00:27):**  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  
**[0:00:31-0:00:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:00:31):**  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. I'm joined today by Stuart Austin, general  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:00:42):**  manager of the Wilmette Cattle Company, a regenerative farming operation with three  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:00:46):**  properties in the New England area of New South Wales, Australia. I actually met Stuart  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:00:51):**  at a pub for a work event, and within about five minutes, I knew I wanted to have him  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:00:56):**  on as a guest. In this episode, Stuart shares how he and his wife Trish got involved in  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:01:02):**  regenerative ag, how the stigma against regen ag is starting to change, and some of the  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:01:07):**  tools that Stuart is using to make six and seven figure decisions around stocking rates  
**[0:01:12-0:01:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:01:12):**  and carrying capacity. Stuart starts by explaining how he and Trish ended up at Wilmette.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:01:18):**  I actually grew up around Albury in southern New South Wales. Trish grew up in central  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:01:22):**  West Queensland, and we met in the Northern Territory 15 years ago. Both of us were separate  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:01:28):**  ways, and then I was back up there. I was managing a property up there, and Trish was  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:01:32):**  working for the Department of Ag for about 10 years. We've been working on stations in  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:01:37):**  the past in the industry up there, and for the last couple of years up there, we were  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:01:41):**  just contracting. We just started to look beyond the NT for opportunities in holistic  
**[0:01:47-0:01:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:01:47):**  management, I suppose. Al had this job advertised, and we didn't even know where Ebor was. Just  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:01:55):**  the way the ad was worded, it sounded really encouraging talking about low stress stock  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:01:59):**  handling and holistic management and rotational grazing, all the things that we were interested  
**[0:02:03-0:02:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:02:03):**  in. We applied quite out of the blue, and by the time we flew down here and had a look  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:02:10):**  around, we couldn't wait to get on board. Thankfully, we were off the job, and we haven't  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:02:14):**  looked back. How did you get interested in holistic management?  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:02:18):**  My grandfather had a property, and he was just a fairly conventional farmer doing what  
**[0:02:24-0:02:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:02:24):**  he knew and acting on the advice he was given at the time, which was typically fairly departmental.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:02:32):**  When I was about probably 22 or 23, I suppose I went to a low stress stock handling school.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:02:40):**  Through that, the people that were involved in that had been involved in holistic management  
**[0:02:44-0:02:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:02:44):**  through RCS from Rockhampton and talked a lot about the Gazing for Profit school. My  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:02:52):**  brother-in-law and his family had been right through Gazing for Profit and Executive Link  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:02:57):**  and all the RCS teachings. I started to spend a bit of time with them in North Queensland  
**[0:03:03-0:03:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:03:03):**  on their properties, and I just really recognised how calm their business was, how low stress  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:03:10):**  it was, their whole business. Their family was very happy. They were quite financially  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:03:15):**  secure. It wasn't because they had the best place, the best soil in the country, or they  
**[0:03:21-0:03:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:03:21):**  inherited everything. They clearly had a very robust business financially and ecologically.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:03:28):**  So they became that family, I suppose, became real mentors to us. Through that, we started  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:03:35):**  to expand our network in that circle. I'm really curious to know more about that.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:03:39):**  What's an example of that calmness and that success of that business? It sounds so appealing,  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:03:45):**  but it's also hard to imagine. Is it like they walked around slower, like the grass  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:03:49):**  looked better?  
**[0:03:50-0:03:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:03:50):**  Kind of in a way, having worked quite a bit across the North, in a lot of places, it's  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:03:57):**  a real numbers game. It's as hard and as fast as you can put them through. It's a turnover  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:04:03):**  business. These guys, I went mustering there for them, contract mustering. I don't know  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:04:08):**  what it would have been probably 15 years ago after I'd been up North for a few years.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:04:14):**  We went mustering, there's a helicopter there. They put some cattle together for us and cows  
**[0:04:18-0:04:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:04:18):**  were coming in calm, calves on them. Everyone was pretty relaxed. We just picked them up,  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:04:25):**  a few dogs, a few people and a fair-sized one with cows. In a way, we'd go and walk  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:04:30):**  to the yards. Cutting cows and calves out was easy. Cattle were in a good frame of mind.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:04:36):**  I was there for, I don't know, I suppose probably a month or six weeks. Through that whole time,  
**[0:04:43-0:04:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:04:43):**  we got a lot done, but there was no stress. Everything just seemed to roll along quite  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:04:51):**  smoothly.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:04:53):**  It was after this experience that Stuart decided to learn more about holistic management. He  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:04:57):**  decided to take the grazing for profit course himself.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:05:00):**  It's a foundation, I suppose, for anyone who's interested in this system of management. We'd  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:05:07):**  known about it for a long time, but we didn't want to do it until we were in a position  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:05:10):**  to be able to implement what we'd learned at the school, which was about the timing.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:05:15):**  It worked out pretty well. We're now part of an executive link board and we've hosted  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:05:21):**  RCS days here, workshops and courses and so forth. We're a real proponent for everything  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:05:26):**  they teach because I've just seen so many examples of people who have undertaken their  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:05:31):**  training and their agricultural businesses are financially robust. People are happy.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:05:38):**  There's some really good succession stories have come through those guys. I just think  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:05:44):**  they're focused on some really key fundamentals about our businesses.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:05:50):**  It sounds like, I mean, my personal journey was into ag through a largely regenerative  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:05:55):**  system and mindset and people who were doing that. I feel like I'm fully bought in, but  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:06:00):**  there's so much still controversy around it and holistic management, but regenerative  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:06:04):**  especially. It feels like there's a bit of a tipping point where it's less kind of seen  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:06:08):**  as hippy dippy, but it's still for a long time been seen as this alternative hippy non-commercial  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:06:13):**  type of practice. Tell me about your experience with either how things are changing or that  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:06:18):**  kind of perception. Is that something that you face?  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:06:20):**  Absolutely. If I go back to that family to North Queensland, for a long time, they will  
**[0:06:27-0:06:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:06:27):**  tell you that anyone who'd done RCS or graduate profit, it was a cult and it was really weird  
**[0:06:34-0:06:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:06:34):**  shit that everyone was doing. It was very much people were outsiders, I guess. In the  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:06:42):**  last, I don't know how long, probably five years, I suppose the tides really started  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:06:46):**  to turn. One of the things I say a lot is that one of the greatest catalyst for change  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:06:51):**  is pain. At the moment, there's a lot of pain in agricultural businesses, by and large driven  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:06:57):**  by the weather, something well and totally beyond our control. I think we're seeing more  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:07:03):**  and more examples of positive stories coming out of farm businesses or agricultural businesses  
**[0:07:09-0:07:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:07:09):**  that are managing regeneratively. They're starting to prove that this isn't some weird  
**[0:07:17-0:07:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:07:17):**  cult or kooky sort of witchcraft. What we do is nothing revolutionary. It's just simplifying  
**[0:07:25-0:07:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:07:25):**  things and going back to some really old ways of being and doing that focus on the fundamental  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:07:32):**  things of making money and looking after our ecology and making sure people are happy.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:07:37):**  Now that Stuart has seen the benefits of these practices, he started to share them with others.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:07:41):**  He's seeing that some of the negative perceptions are starting to change.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:07:46):**  I think one of the most encouraging things we've seen or I've personally seen, I suppose,  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:07:50):**  we had a field day here in February this year and we had nearly 300 people turn up. It took  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:07:56):**  a while for that to sink in. There was a couple of people afterwards told me that was the  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:07:59):**  best field I've ever been to. It took a little while for me to sink in afterwards. I've  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:03):**  been to a lot of field days. I've never been to one on a farm with a lot of people.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:07):**  The whole premise of the day was around education and helping people with decision making and  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:12):**  thinking differently and thinking about things the way we think about things here. We had  
**[0:08:17-0:08:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:17):**  examples through the day of other people who do things the way we do things. In a non-confrontational  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:24):**  way, not trying to jam it down in one stroke, but show that there is another way of thinking  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:30):**  and way of doing things that may mean that you're more profitable and that your land  
**[0:08:34-0:08:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:34):**  is healthier and that you are happier.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:37):**  Help me bring that to life in terms of one of the examples you might have used at the  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:40):**  field day or something you guys do that's seen as quite different but is effective.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:43):**  There's probably two things come to mind. One would be we talk about managing our stocking  
**[0:08:48-0:08:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:48):**  rate to our carrying capacity dynamically. It's constantly changing. That's quite an  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:54):**  area for a lot of people, particularly people who traditionally run a breeding enterprise  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:08:59):**  where the last resort is to have to sell their breeding stock. At Wilmot, we run a trading  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:09:05):**  enterprise. To me, cattle are a tool that we use to number one, make money and number  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:09:10):**  two, heal the landscape. I have no trouble in buying and selling cattle and we do it  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:09:14):**  all the time, week to week, month to month. There's always cattle coming or going from  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:09:18):**  here as and when our grass determines we need to adjust our stocking rate.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:09:22):**  We also have a breeding enterprise at Walca on our property down there. That is a much  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:09:27):**  harder decision for us to make but it's one that we know we have to make. We've gone from  
**[0:09:31-0:09:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:09:31):**  800 cows there in June last year to about 250 left there now. As our grass is determined,  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:09:44):**  we just kept selling down cows. It is a harder decision to make but once you overcome that  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:09:48):**  paradigm that they're irreplaceable and recognise that your country will be grateful for you  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:09:54):**  having made that decision and so will your bank account, it becomes easier to do. That's  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:10:00):**  one thing. The other thing probably that comes to mind that is quite different and takes  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:10:05):**  a bit of coming to terms with is small numbers of large mobs. We run mobs of up to 1500 head  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:10:12):**  of cattle here, 20 hectare paddock and often they're moved. This time of year, we're moving  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:10:17):**  almost daily. Some places are more intensive than us. We're moving three or four or five  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:10:22):**  times a day. That's quite a hard thing for a lot of people to fathom. It seems like a  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:10:28):**  lot of work but in fact, it's a lot less work. It's very enjoyable. Fundamentally, the biggest  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:10:35):**  thing that does for us is increase our density which changes our landscape so much quicker.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:10:40):**  We've got people in the district still ask us if we still run those big mobs and do all  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:10:47):**  that other funny stuff. I say, yes, we do. Everyone always says we've got so much grass  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:10:51):**  here. Why do you have so much grass? You must have enough cattle.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:10:55):**  It's so interesting. The story you hear in the regenerative ag space is the Alan Savory  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:11:01):**  classic like, look at this property and the fence and the other property and this one's  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:11:05):**  been managed holistically and look how much greener and nicer it is versus that one but  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:11:10):**  you guys are actually living that. I think you mentioned that with the fires that that's  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:11:15):**  actually had maybe an adverse effect. I don't know if you want to tell that story but it  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:11:20):**  always brings it to life when it's not a picture but it's someone living it and you actually  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:11:24):**  go see that farm next to the other one and can really see how different it truly is.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:11:28):**  Yes, for sure. We do see that every day. The first thing that comes to mind is I wish I  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:11:35):**  could help that person on the other side of the fence. One of the things I've always said  
**[0:11:41-0:11:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:11:41):**  is one of the biggest barriers to change is the human ego. That's why we do what we do  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:11:49):**  here in terms of the workshops and the courses and the field days is to try and open the  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:11:53):**  door and show people what we do and why we do it and perhaps this might help them. We  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:11:58):**  see that fence line effect every day and we don't think we're better than anyone else.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:12:01):**  We just I suppose we like to think that our land is a bit healthier. Definitely one of  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:12:06):**  the flip sides to that was in early September when we had a bushfire come through here and  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:12:12):**  we had more grass than most of our neighbors and meant we lost a lot of country and grass  
**[0:12:17-0:12:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:12:17):**  that we had stockpiled I suppose for a few months. We had plenty of feed in front of  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:12:24):**  us and that was taken away in a matter of hours. The fire then burned out as it went  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:12:30):**  into our neighbors where there wasn't grass to burn. That was a bit of an irony and quite  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:12:35):**  heartbreaking and certainly there were some tough decisions to make around our stocking  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:12:39):**  rate and our canicabustia because we basically just had the amount of grass we had halved  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:12:44):**  so we needed to halve our stocking rate overnight which is effectively what we did the next  
**[0:12:48-0:12:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:12:48):**  week. Again, not a lazy decision to make but one we nearly had to make.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:12:56):**  Tell me a bit about the Wilmette brand. How does that work? We talked a little bit about  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:13:01):**  this before but are you direct to consumer? Is it branded as grass fed? How does the downstream  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:13:06):**  supply chain work? I guess one of the reasons I ask is often there's a balance between doing  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:13:11):**  regenerative practices because that's what will be more profitable and keep the family  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:13:15):**  and team sane versus it unlocks some premium for consumers. Tell me a little bit about  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:13:21):**  how downstream works for you guys and how you think about regenerative in terms of premiums  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:13:25):**  and consumers.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:13:26):**  Sure. We don't have our own brand presently. We have had in the past and we've learned  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:13:35):**  a lot of things around that. It was actually just before I got here. It was somewhat small  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:13:39):**  scale and being marketed domestically and the scale we can't issue that we needed more  
**[0:13:44-0:13:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:13:44):**  scale so we increased that and learned a few more lessons. We then did a lot of due diligence  
**[0:13:51-0:13:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:13:51):**  sort of last year around I guess a full scale supply chain into the US marketing a grass  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:13:58):**  fed beef product and in the end decided that the capital required and that the risk associated  
**[0:14:05-0:14:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:14:05):**  with that was really a bit too large for what we were comfortable with at this stage. That's  
**[0:14:12-0:14:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:14:12):**  our long-term goal or vision. It's to be rewarded for the land management that we undertake  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:14:22):**  through the beef that we sell. I think it's still a little bit way off. There are some  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:14:28):**  people who are doing it really well but it is also a very small portion of their business.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:14:33):**  Even when we were there was 12 months where we were supplying quite a significant volume  
**[0:14:38-0:14:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:14:38):**  monthly and even then it was probably only 10% of our turnover. It sort of finishes the  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:14:45):**  story I guess for us. That's the reason why we're still at the bottom of our heart as  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:14:51):**  something we'd like to do in the long term. Everything we do is geared around the health  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:14:56):**  of our soil, the health of our ecosystem, the health of our animals, the health of our  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:15:00):**  people and our bank account. Being able to put that story on a box and say that this  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:15:06):**  is the healthiest beef you can buy because of the life it's had, that's ultimately the  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:15:12):**  story we'd like to tell. There are absolutely some production challenges associated with  
**[0:15:16-0:15:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:15:16):**  that and with the typical marketing environment where a consumer wants that product month  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:15:23):**  in, month out in such a variable climate that we live in that's proving quite challenging  
**[0:15:29-0:15:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:15:29):**  to meet. It's been a demise I'd say probably 95% of the brands that have failed have been  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:15:39):**  inability to supply in tough times. It's something we haven't yet overcome but perhaps one day  
**[0:15:45-0:15:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:15:45):**  we will.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:15:46):**  Yeah. Do you ever get into local debates or maybe not local around grass fed beef and  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:15:56):**  holistically managed livestock versus plant-based protein versus cellular agriculture like that  
**[0:16:02-0:16:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:16:02):**  beef is the evil environmental degrading force and we can't produce cows but no, I'm doing  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:16:08):**  it healthy. Do you ever find yourself in the middle of that debate or any examples of having  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:16:12):**  to defend beef in that sense?  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:16:15):**  I think I'm mellowing with age. I am quite active on social media, mostly on Facebook  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:16:20):**  and have been known to engage in some fairly heated conversations on there but always try  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:16:26):**  to be respectful and look at both sides of the story. I haven't been so much of late  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:16:32):**  but certainly have learned a lot about both sides of the story and one of the interesting  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:16:37):**  things I really found about plant-based meat is that 95% of the people that are eating  
**[0:16:41-0:16:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:16:41):**  plant-based meats are in fact meat-itarians not vegetarians and they are discontented  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:16:49):**  with the production system, the conventional production system of their beef and they're  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:16:55):**  looking for it's sort of I guess a silent protest in terms of they still want to eat  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:16:59):**  beef and they still love the taste and the smell of everything and everything that goes  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:17:03):**  with it but they don't agree with the supply chain and that's something that we need to  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:17:08):**  get better at doing and telling I think.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:17:12):**  Yeah, it's such a challenge. We're in marketing now so similar all the time like everything  
**[0:17:18-0:17:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:17:18):**  looks like it's natural and healthy and good for you and like non-GMO and all these terms  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:17:26):**  that don't mean anything and aren't regulated. It's just so hard to tell a story that's authentic  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:17:30):**  when especially decisions are made in one second by someone who's busy and thinking  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:17:35):**  about price mostly.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:17:36):**  For sure and it's such a, I mean I don't know how we overcome that. I guess someone asked  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:17:43):**  me the other day how do we educate the masses about what we do and I just said you've got  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:17:47):**  to open the gate. Basically we invite them in here, front gates open all the time to  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:17:52):**  come and see how we produce our beef and what we do and how we do it and show them that  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:17:57):**  the way we produce our beef is good for the environment. We ask sequestering carbon and  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:01):**  we're actually about to do a carbon audit here and quite confident that we are carbon  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:05):**  negative in our production system but how do we get that message all the way to the  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:10):**  consumer in Sydney? From little old Ebor, here's a challenge and we can preach that  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:15):**  what we do is the best thing but if we can't supply a product every day of the week on  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:19):**  a shelf in the supermarket then it's still not good enough.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:23):**  Tell me about the carbon audit, like why did you decide to do that and especially like  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:28):**  on the technology side often one of the big challenges with that kind of thing is just  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:32):**  how cost effective it largely isn't to do that kind of work. So how are you thinking  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:37):**  about that process?  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:39):**  So we have been, I guess it started with our soil testing and since 2012 we've been soil  
**[0:18:45-0:18:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:45):**  testing here about nine different sites across the farm and we do it in about May every year  
**[0:18:52-0:18:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:52):**  and each year we look at all our macro and micro minerals across our soil and one of  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:18:59):**  the things we focus a lot on is carbon and we have seen at shovel depth on those same  
**[0:19:04-0:19:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:19:04):**  transects over the last seven years an increase in soil carbon from a base of about 2.3% to  
**[0:19:12-0:19:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:19:12):**  a peak in 2017 of nearly over 5% and we're sort of back hovering around 4.5%, 4.7% soil  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:19:22):**  organic carbon which is a dramatic increase and one of the biggest things that's done  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:19:28):**  that has been the intensity of our grazing and that was the real thing that changed that  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:19:32):**  saw us increase in soil organic carbon. So we've done all kinds of sums around that and  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:19:37):**  we've shared this information fairly widely around the world with some different organisations  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:19:42):**  trying to look at ways that we can be rewarded for that in terms of the whole Emission Reduction  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:19:47):**  Scheme, carbon farming, all these different things that are talked about but no one is  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:19:52):**  quite crack and neither are we. So carbon audit the other day talking about whether  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:19:58):**  we could sell a carbon negative beef product came up and we have had an audit done here  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:20:04):**  a few years ago and I can't remember exactly, we may have been slightly carbon positive  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:20:10):**  at that point but we're now fairly confident that we would be carbon negative. So can we  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:20:16):**  then develop a brand and write a story around that? Whether or not we'll be monetised for  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:20:20):**  that still remains to be seen. We work with a consulting company in Arbida Island, we've  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:20:24):**  got a guy there who's leaving no stone unturned trying to find ways that we can be remunerated  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:20:30):**  for what we're doing here. Nevertheless it's something that we continue to focus on every  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:20:34):**  day in our system and our long term goal is to try and get our soil carbon back to about  
**[0:20:40-0:20:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:20:40):**  6% which from a CSIRO report from 1960 that's about where we were. So hopefully one day  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:20:48):**  we can monetise those gains.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:20:52):**  One of the ways that Stuart has been able to implement some of these regen practices  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:20:56):**  is through the use of technology. Not only do they use tech but they've actually been  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:21:00):**  involved in the development of some tech solutions when they couldn't find anything available  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:21:05):**  on the market.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:21:06):**  We like to think of ourselves as fairly technically advanced I suppose and an earlier doctor of  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:21:13):**  new technology and we use it fundamentally to make decisions, capturing data and then  
**[0:21:19-0:21:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:21:19):**  making decisions from that data. So my engraving was developed four or five years ago on the  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:21:27):**  back of Wilmot basically. The manager who was here prior to me, he was the one that  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:21:32):**  started the rotational grazing and increasing the intensity here, was using paper grazing  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:21:37):**  charts and what he was achieving was clearly evident in the paddock and talked a lot about  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:21:42):**  grazing charts but upper management couldn't see that.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:21:46):**  So Bart Davidson in all his wisdom said he'd always had a dream about making that an online  
**[0:21:52-0:22:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:21:52):**  development system for planning and forecasting and recording etc. So Mya began and Wilmot  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:22:01):**  has, was and still is the guinea pig for Mya. We use it every day in our management here  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:22:07):**  basically to graze plans. We're constantly out in the paddock feed budgeting looking  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:22:14):**  ahead of ourselves and seeing how much we're in volume, how much we're grazing in each  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:22:20):**  graze and how much we've got in front of us to be able to graze, how many days grazing  
**[0:22:24-0:22:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:22:24):**  in front we have. We're coming back and plugging that into a grazing plan and then we can extend  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:22:31):**  that out into a three and six and 12 month forecast and then we can start to make decisions  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:22:36):**  around our stocking rate which then influences our turnover, which influences our bottom  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:22:42):**  line. So when I go to write our budget every year the first thing I do is go out in the  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:22:46):**  paddock and take stock of our grass inventory and then I start to forecast in Mya what I  
**[0:22:52-0:22:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:22:52):**  think our rainfall will be and how many cattle I think we can graze through each month of  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:22:59):**  the year and I then start plugging that back into the budget as to how many cattle we need  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:23:03):**  to buy and how many we need to sell and then that ultimately determines what our bottom  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:23:07):**  line is going to look like for the year. But we're constantly re-budgeting I suppose or  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:23:12):**  re-forecasting every month. That changes as our own for whether we get more or less than  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:23:17):**  what we forecast we're then adjusting that forecast stocking rate. So it's a very powerful  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:23:24):**  tool. I say that I make $100,000 decisions with it probably weekly if not million dollar  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:23:30):**  decisions with it. So the cost of it is incidental really. I don't even notice it coming out  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:23:36):**  of the bank account for the value of the decisions that we make with it.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:23:40):**  What was it like to be the pilot slash part of the development? That can be one of the  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:23:45):**  things in ag tech that's often talked about is like I want to be the fast follower so  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:23:49):**  that I don't have to go through the pain of having it work for a while. I just want it  
**[0:23:53-0:23:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:23:53):**  to work. What was that like?  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:23:55):**  It was good fun and we still have fun with it. One of the things I really enjoy is business  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:24:00):**  development and while this isn't necessarily business development we were certainly involved  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:24:04):**  in product development. So we road tested a lot of things but it also gave us an opportunity  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:24:09):**  to give a lot of constructive feedback to say this is working really well for us. This  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:24:14):**  is something we think you need to change. This is one of our frustrations. I had Bart  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:24:20):**  on speed dial there for a while in terms of support issues but I think one of their greatest  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:24:25):**  strengths is their support team. Trish in fact before she went on maternity leave was  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:24:31):**  their support team leader and there's four or five girls now in the support team and  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:24:35):**  all of them use the product at home. I think that's really valuable to Mya when people  
**[0:24:41-0:24:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:24:41):**  ring up with issues. People like me who are graziers and we just want it to work and the  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:24:49):**  girls all understand our frustrations I suppose but they're very proactive in fixing things  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:24:54):**  and creating a program that's really user friendly for people like us. So it's been  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:25:00):**  really good fun and it's exciting. We actually have the whole Mya crew come up here each  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:25:06):**  year and they have a little corporate love in up here and that's a great opportunity  
**[0:25:10-0:25:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:25:10):**  for us to get them in the paddock and show them how we use it in the paddock and how  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:25:13):**  it's working or not working for us and again give them some constructive feedback as to  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:25:17):**  how we think it could work better. So yeah I would say it's been good fun.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:25:23):**  Yeah right so when the next tech product comes knocking saying hey do you want to be a pilot  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:25:28):**  user slash help me co-develop this are you gonna say yes?  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:25:31):**  For sure. We're always looking for things that we can integrate into the system here.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:25:38):**  I believe Stuart when he says that he'll say yes. He has a lot of examples of different  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:25:43):**  tech that he's using, trialing or helping to develop.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:25:47):**  We've also sort of other guinea pig or I suppose with a pilot for farm bot and Mya's integration.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:25:55):**  We've now got a farm bot rain gauge here that is pushing information straight into Mya,  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:26:01):**  rainfall information straight into Mya. So that's terrific.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:26:05):**  Stuart also has a bit of a wish list for some ag tech that he wants but hasn't found.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:26:10):**  And the one that I really want that I've been asking you know in a few different places  
**[0:26:14-0:26:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:26:14):**  for is a soil probe under a rain gauge so that we can start to look pretty closely at  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:26:21):**  our infiltration levels of every time we get rain how much are we infiltrating and how  
**[0:26:27-0:26:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:26:27):**  versus how much is running off and also how much are we retaining in our soil and for  
**[0:26:34-0:26:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:26:34):**  how long because if our soil health is improving as we think it is and as a soil test is suggesting  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:26:41):**  we should be a water retention should improve and infiltration should improve but the only  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:26:46):**  way to really test that is how much rain do we get versus how much do we retain and the  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:26:50):**  soil probe is what I need to be able to do that. So if there's anyone who's got a thinks  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:26:56):**  they have a product that could do that I'm very keen to hear about it.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:27:00):**  Great. We'll get the word out.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:27:01):**  One thing that struck me during my conversation with Stuart like many of the producers who  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:27:10):**  come on the podcast was that he's so open about what they do and how they do it. Given  
**[0:27:15-0:27:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:27:15):**  transparency is such a buzzword in agriculture right now and consumer mistrust feels like  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:27:21):**  it's at an all time high. I wanted to ask Stuart why is he so open?  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:27:26):**  We're just quite open about sharing our story. We don't profess to know it all or have all  
**[0:27:29-0:27:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:27:29):**  the answers but we're all keen to help other people and that comes right from Al who owns  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:27:36):**  the place and it's the reason that we host the field and it's on again in 2020 27th of  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:27:43):**  February at Wilmot and we've got a cracking lineup of speakers. And again the day won't  
**[0:27:47-0:27:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:27:47):**  necessarily be about Wilmot but it'll be about bringing people to the farm to share their  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:27:54):**  knowledge to help other people because we're all in this together and plenty of my friends  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:28:01):**  are in just as much pain as anyone else and if I could help anyone I'd love to be able  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:28:06):**  to help them. So like I say if anyone's got any questions about anything we do we're always  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:28:13):**  willing to share.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:28:15):**  I guess there's pretty different views on this openness question and I find it fascinating  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:28:21):**  that some people are like I'm oversimplifying but on one side of the spectrum it's just  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:28:27):**  trust us where we care about the land and the animals, let us do what we do best and  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:28:32):**  get on with being a consumer and on the other end it's like come have a look anytime, learn  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:28:37):**  more, like ask us questions, we're super open which I find so fascinating like there's such  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:28:42):**  different answers in the same industry and even some people doing the same kinds of practices.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:28:46):**  I don't know if you have any thoughts on that but it always strikes me as both yeah just  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:28:51):**  just such a stark difference in the industry.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:28:56):**  Yes that is a really good question Sarah and I sort of struggle to think of it from the  
**[0:29:04-0:29:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:04):**  other perspective of just trust us because I guess if that was someone telling that to  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:11):**  me I'd be asking what they've got to hide, what are you scared of us saying, what are  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:16):**  you worried about and if we hold hardly can you know put a hand in our heart and say that  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:21):**  we're doing the very best we can by animals and our land then we should be willing to  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:26):**  open the door because without a customer we don't have a market, without a market we might  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:32):**  as well not be producing the product that we're producing so like any business our customer  
**[0:29:36-0:29:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:36):**  is always right.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:38):**  To close out my chat with Stuart I wanted to try something new.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:41):**  I attempted to ask him a couple of rapid-fire questions.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:44):**  So first one, do your kids want to be involved in farming?  
**[0:29:48-0:29:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:48):**  Yes Harry's nearly five and I can rarely leave the house without him what he'd become.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:56):**  I love it very cool.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:29:58):**  What's your most proud farm moment?  
**[0:30:01-0:30:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:30:01):**  It could be from this year in your past.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:30:03):**  Oh that's a big question I'd say the field day would take some topping.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:30:11):**  Yeah that was quite a special day I guess and like I said it took a few months to sort  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:30:18):**  of come to terms with the fact that that many people have turned up to come and see and  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:30:23):**  hear what we had to say.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:30:25):**  Another little highlight this year was being awarded the Young Carbon Farmer of the Year  
**[0:30:32-0:30:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:30:32):**  award in August.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:30:33):**  It was completely unexpected and quite kind recognition of what we've been trying to do  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:30:39):**  here.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:30:40):**  Is there a book or movie that's been influential in your life that others should check out?  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:30:47):**  There was a book actually I read this a long time ago but it had a profound impact on my  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:30:53):**  life it was called You Inc written by John McGraw from McGraw Real Estates and I read  
**[0:31:00-0:31:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:31:00):**  it I don't know 16 years ago and that book certainly changed my life in terms of my attitude  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:31:08):**  and outlook to life and probably my personality.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:31:12):**  And a movie that I have watched well again when I was younger this would be a bit of  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:31:19):**  a throwback but remember the Titans was a fairly influential movie.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:31:24):**  There's a little sign on the wall in that movie that says attitude reflects leadership  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:31:31):**  I've never forgotten that there's a lot of hidden messages in that movie that are worth  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:31:36):**  trying to take home.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=533282#t=0:31:38):**  That's really awesome thank you so much for making the time this was a good chat for sure

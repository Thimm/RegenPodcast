### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 22 Jan 2020 19:50:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:00:12):**  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:00:17):**  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:00:22):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:00:27):**  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  
**[0:00:31-0:00:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:00:31):**  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. When we think about ag tech, at least here  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:00:43):**  at Agthentic, we aren't just thinking about the technologies themselves. We're thinking  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:00:47):**  about new business models in agriculture. And of course, we're thinking about the innovators  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:00:51):**  that are driving changes along the value chain. Today's guest, Fiona Aveyard, is definitely  
**[0:00:57-0:01:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:00:57):**  an innovator and an entrepreneur, as well as a farmer. Though Fiona does use technology  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:01:03):**  and make lots of data-driven decisions on her farm, what we talk about today is how  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:01:07):**  she's working on a new supply chain and new value-add products that can bring more profit  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:01:13):**  to her farm and can bring benefits to her regional community. And we talk about how  
**[0:01:18-0:01:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:01:18):**  Fiona is doing all of this while facing the worst drought in history and what that's like.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:01:24):**  This episode is again part of our series in partnership with Farmers to Founders. Farmers  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:01:29):**  to Founders is an innovation program designed specifically for primary producers. Fiona  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:01:34):**  is one of the businesses in the program. Applications are open now at farmerstofounders.com for  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:01:40):**  the IDEAS program. So if you're a producer with an invention that you think could be  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:01:44):**  commercialized or an idea for a new product, check out the IDEAS program. It provides support,  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:01:50):**  coaching, funding, and a community of other innovative and entrepreneurial producers.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:01:55):**  So with that, here's Fiona. She starts by giving us a rundown of her property.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:02:01):**  So we are mixed farm, what I would call a traditional mixed farming operation in central  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:02:06):**  New South Wales. We're about an hour southwest of Dubbo. Our nearest small town is called  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:02:11):**  Tullamore. We're about 25 k's from there. So there's me, my husband, Bill, and we've  
**[0:02:16-0:02:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:02:16):**  got four children. We live on a farm that joins the farm I grew up on and we would be  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:02:24):**  fifth generation farmers in the area. So even the farm that we live on is actually is a  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:02:29):**  soldier settlers block that was cleaved off the original holdings that my ancestors had,  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:02:35):**  you know, 130 years ago. But after the second world war, I think they did, they broke a  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:02:41):**  lot of the properties up to give the return soldiers blocks, which worked really well  
**[0:02:46-0:02:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:02:46):**  in the small communities for a long time. But as farming changed and mechanization and  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:02:53):**  expansion and all that sort of stuff, that a lot of the smaller properties were eaten  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:02:57):**  up by the adjoining ones. And so that's how Bill and I had the opportunity to buy here.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:03:03):**  And so it's 1500 acres at West Point where we live. We own the next door place, which  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:03:09):**  is Warranilla in partnership with my sister. I've got another block that is on the other  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:03:14):**  side of the Aurora Park, which is my dad's place called Robbo's, which we bought a few  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:03:21):**  years ago. And then my husband has his block up at Trundle, which is part of his family  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:03:26):**  succession. He's got two other brothers and they've got block country there as well.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:03:30):**  And all mixed farming across all those different properties?  
**[0:03:33-0:03:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:03:33):**  Yep. So we have Merinos for the wool production. We usually run around 1000 Merino used and  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:03:43):**  we've got crossbred used. We usually run between 1000 and 2000. It sort of depends on the seasons  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:03:49):**  and how much cropping we're doing and that sort of thing. And then we have, we do mixed  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:03:56):**  cereal cropping. So wheat, barley, canola, chickpeas, oats, that sort of stuff, cut our  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:04:02):**  own hay, store grain on farm for the dry periods and do all that sort of thing. Bill's brother  
**[0:04:08-0:04:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:04:08):**  has a Merino stud. My sister breeds camp drafting horses and my dad breeds standard bred horses.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:04:18):**  But yeah, generally it's the sheep and cattle and we haven't got any cows at the moment.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:04:23):**  We normally have Angus cattle, but they've been long gone in this dry period.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:04:27):**  Fiona, like many farmers in Australia, has been experiencing some seriously extreme weather.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:04:33):**  Though the floods, drought and fires have been in the news locally and globally, it's  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:04:37):**  really hard to get a sense of what's actually happening, what it's like for the farmers  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:04:41):**  and for the regional communities they live in, without seeing it yourself. When I spoke  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:04:46):**  with Fiona, the east coast of Australia had just gotten some much needed rain. West Point,  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:04:52):**  Fiona's farm, did get some as well, but it came with another challenge.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:04:58):**  We did. We got under a jagged, very narrow storm the other day. We had 20 mils. That  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:05:03):**  was before the massive dust storm. I don't know if you've seen it all over social media  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:05:07):**  today. It stretched honestly from the northwest to the southwest. It was the biggest dust  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:05:12):**  storm I've ever seen. It looks like a movie. Like it looks like when they go to like a  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:05:17):**  different planet in a movie and they're like, oh, this planet is a desert planet with dust  
**[0:05:21-0:05:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:05:21):**  storms. No, no, that's just Australia. Yeah, that's just central New South Wales.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:05:28):**  So that's exactly what it was like. And it came in like normally you get a lot of wind  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:05:32):**  and there's a bit of a build up before it gets a bit stormy and all that. But this was  
**[0:05:36-0:05:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:05:36):**  so, there was no wind. Like it moved really quickly and it was quiet and very eerie. Like  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:05:44):**  it was very, yeah, just a bit unsettling to be honest.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:05:48):**  Oh yeah. It looked like a mountain. It was really crazy. So that impacted you guys then  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:05:53):**  directly like does the dust come over your property and what impact if any does that  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:05:57):**  have?  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:05:58):**  It's more like it's the house. Like it's, it covers everything with this fine red dust  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:06:05):**  that is, it doesn't matter. Well, our house is an old farm cottage anyway, so it's not  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:06:09):**  dust proof at the best of times, but this is the sort of the permeates like a sealed  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:06:15):**  chamber. It just, it covers everything in your house, the walls, everything with this  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:06:21):**  layer of dust that you just like, it's so hard to move. So that's what, that's what's  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:06:28):**  disheartening. It doesn't really do anything per se. I mean, apart from obviously the obvious,  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:06:32):**  which is blow your top soil away and all that sort of thing, but we'd had some rain and  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:06:36):**  you know, things were a bit more grounded here. That's obviously coming from out West.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:06:40):**  Yeah, it's just more the, and it gets dark like it's like in the footage that you see  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:06:46):**  of the bushfires, literally it just blocks out the sun for the 10 or 15 minutes that  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:06:50):**  it's going past.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:06:51):**  Oh my gosh, that is terrifying. It literally is a movie, but not a movie.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:06:57):**  It's just that sad, sad real life.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:07:00):**  As if the dust storm wasn't enough, Fiona is still battling the drought.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:07:05):**  We ran out of farm water on the farm that my, where my sister lives that joins us about  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:07:11):**  six months ago and our house ran dry this week. So we've moved all our livestock up  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:07:17):**  to another property at Trundle where there's better water and we've got a couple of hundred  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:07:21):**  deer that we're just carting water for. So it's just, it's like one step in front of  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:07:25):**  the other, like it's a grind actually. It'll have to end soon.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:07:30):**  You say that so casually, like, Oh yeah, and then we're just out of water and it's like,  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:07:34):**  what? I'm sorry. That's a massive deal. I actually did want to ask you about that. If  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:07:39):**  you're okay with that, just a little bit about kind of some, some color for people who maybe  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:07:44):**  haven't been in regional Australia during the drought or don't actually know kind of  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:07:48):**  what it's like. Cause I think you, you talk about it in a way that's really honest and  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:07:52):**  would love to share a little bit of that if you're up for it.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:07:56):**  Yeah, no, absolutely. And it's the hardest thing to explain. Like it's because it is  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:08:02):**  a grind. Like you just, it's just one foot in front of the other day after day, you're  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:08:06):**  doing the same thing and you know that the seasons will change. But then as you get closer  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:08:12):**  to like last year is a good example, as we've got closer to that autumn break and we didn't  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:08:17):**  get an early autumn break, but there was some forecast of some, of some weather. So we're  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:08:22):**  pretty optimistic. There were a couple of cyclones up in the North and that usually  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:08:26):**  feeds in down here pretty well. And that's certainly what all the forecast was saying.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:08:30):**  So you're, there's an anticipation and excitement that comes with farming because it's an exciting  
**[0:08:36-0:08:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:08:36):**  time to be planting your crops or, you know, joining your sheep and all that sort of stuff.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:08:39):**  And it's a bit like we've got horses as well. I always say it's like when you pick a stallion  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:08:44):**  for your mare and all the foals born and it's always the Derby when I'm liking it, it's  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:08:49):**  the excitement of the possibilities. So you get, you do get excited, even though as it  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:08:54):**  turned out, we didn't get that early autumn break, you didn't get a mid autumn break and  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:08:58):**  we didn't get a late autumn break. We've got no rain all year. So that's really hard. And  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:09:03):**  as you get those trigger points for your plan for where you're going to be, if you're going  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:09:08):**  to do stock or how you're going to manage, you know, do you buy more feed and you're  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:09:13):**  doing those sort of budgeting and talking to your bank managers and trying to figure  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:09:18):**  out exactly how you're going to do things. And as those, as those trigger points get  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:09:21):**  closer, you get more and more anxious because you're like, if there's a forecast rain event,  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:09:26):**  you know, you've got a date on the first of September or something, there's a forecast  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:09:29):**  rain event for the middle of September. You're like, do I hang on another two weeks or do  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:09:34):**  I stick to my plan? Like it's just anxiety and just, you get, you just, you can't second  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:09:39):**  guess at it. It's awful. I can't say it any other way. It's awful.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:09:44):**  It sounds like the up and down of it is just exhausting too. The kind of constant hope  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:09:50):**  and then not hope and then hope again and then not hope that, that in any context is  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:09:55):**  exhausting and in one so important as this seems overwhelming.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:09:59):**  Yeah, that's it. And it's gone on for years, which is really, that's the grind, I guess,  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:10:05):**  in terms of it does get you down. I mean, people are obviously, people are well aware  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:10:10):**  of mental health issues and particularly in farming because there is, you know, in high  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:10:14):**  incidence of people suffering or having suffered, you know, taking their lives and that sort  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:10:18):**  of thing with mental health. But there's not that many of us. So people really keep an  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:10:22):**  eye out on each other and reach out all the time. And most of us have been here for such  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:10:28):**  a long time. We do, like we're optimists in that we know it will rain again. Like we've  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:10:32):**  all been in droughts. We've never been in a drought like this. And there is the added  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:10:38):**  reality I guess of climate change and this is what farming is going to be and what's,  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:10:44):**  how are we going to deal with that and what's the legacy we're leaving for the next generation  
**[0:10:48-0:10:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:10:48):**  that is a, again, another burden of how you're approaching your job and what changes we have  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:10:55):**  to make now for it to take effect to benefit the next generation. So there's, there's a  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:11:01):**  lot, lot of things that people have to consider that are very, you know, nobody's got the  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:11:06):**  answers, I guess. You just have to really believe in what you believe and pin your ears  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:11:10):**  back and hope for the best.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:11:12):**  Yeah. I want to go back to something you said before, if you know about trigger points,  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:11:17):**  is that a kind of concept, like conceptual trigger points or is it actually more of a  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:11:22):**  set of management decisions you guys would set up in advance?  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:11:25):**  Yeah, so that's exactly what it is. So if when there's grass in the paddocks, like what  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:11:31):**  point you're going to move sheep on, when there's like no rain and you're getting to  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:11:37):**  a point where you want to join stock, what are you actually going to join and what's  
**[0:11:41-0:11:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:11:41):**  not going to be productive for you for the next 12 months going forward. So do you sell  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:11:47):**  them? Do you, you know, how do you market them? All that sort of stuff. Do they go into  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:11:51):**  a fat market? Are they fat enough to go into a fat market? Are you looking for a restock  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:11:54):**  or all that sort of thing. So, and the trigger points for most of us where we're not on irrigation  
**[0:12:00-0:12:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:12:00):**  life, we are usually around a date. Like it'll be, if we haven't had rain by the end of the  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:12:07):**  autumn, then what are we going to do for the winter? Right. We're going to carry this many  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:12:11):**  stock. We've got this much feed. How are we going to manage that? And you know, what are  
**[0:12:15-0:12:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:12:15):**  we going to look after and all that sort of thing.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:12:18):**  The coverage of the drought in the news talks a lot about the impact to regional communities.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:12:23):**  Speaking with Fiona helped me to understand what that really looks like, the cash flow  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:12:28):**  challenges that individual businesses are facing and the flow on effects to other businesses  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:12:33):**  and to the community as a whole. The hardest thing is when you're, it's year cash flow.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:12:39):**  So when you're basing your decisions around rain events and you might have a budget for  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:12:45):**  a certain time or you'll have commitments in terms of maybe fertiliser or stock feed  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:12:51):**  or shearing or stuff outgoing so that you can't not pay. And then all of a sudden you're  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:12:58):**  like, oh, the shearers ring, they're coming two weeks earlier. You've just got a load  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:13:03):**  of feed. The money's not in so you will because it didn't reach them what you wanted at sale.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:13:08):**  So you held off pushing you think you needed it for another month. And it's those cash  
**[0:13:11-0:13:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:13:11):**  flow kind of components that are very tricky and it just makes you, that's what puts people  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:13:19):**  under enormous pressure because then they don't want to go out because they're not,  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:13:23):**  it's not that they can't pay their bills, they're just slow paying them because the  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:13:26):**  money in these economies when you're in regional areas, everything slows down. So one, if you're  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:13:31):**  slow paying your fuel and they're slow paying their bill, like it just flows on. And that's  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:13:36):**  when people isolate themselves, which is the real danger. So it's in terms of your mental  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:13:41):**  health and that type of thing. So it's very, it's hard to stay on top of everything all  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:13:46):**  the time when there's so many variables, I guess.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:13:49):**  Yeah, exactly. And with the, I mean the joke I've been seeing around Twitter recently is  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:13:54):**  like how can any of these weather people or tech companies predicting the weather keep  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:13:58):**  their jobs because they just keep being so wrong?  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:14:02):**  Well, we all know it's hard, like, and particularly in the summer, like we're not, it's unlikely  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:14:09):**  we're going to get general rain in the summer. It's all going to be storm events because  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:14:13):**  that's traditionally what happens. It doesn't, you know, climate change or no climate change,  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:14:18):**  you get your good general rain in the autumn and the winter time. We, you know, pray for  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:14:22):**  a spring break to get crops through. And if you're lucky enough to jag something in the  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:14:27):**  summertime, then you'll grow a few cat heads and some bathyspheres, you know.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:14:32):**  Despite the truly catastrophic challenges that farmers like Fiona are facing right now,  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:14:38):**  it's situations like these that can also really help to bring people together.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:14:42):**  I think we're all seeing it with the fires as well, so that probably people will understand  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:14:47):**  so much more. But we do farm tours on the farm and the number of people that have come  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:14:51):**  out in the holidays to do a farm tour and because they follow us on social media and  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:14:56):**  they know it's really dry and they want to come and spend some time in the country, that  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:15:01):**  type of thing. And so that's really, and they bring, the rule is usually, like when we were  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:15:06):**  growing up, if people came to visit you, they always stopped in town and got some fresh  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:15:09):**  milk and the daily newspaper because they're the sort of things you don't get on the farm.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:15:14):**  And the people that come out here, you know, they'll grab some fresh fruit and veg and,  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:15:18):**  you know, just pop out and do a farm tour and hang out, have lunch with us. And it's  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:15:22):**  the fact that they care is what, you know, sort of catches in your throat. It makes you  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:15:27):**  really just a better person, really, because then, you know, hopefully we can pay it forward  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:15:32):**  one day and everything will go around nicely.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:15:36):**  Seeing the challenges in her local community and thinking about the future is actually  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:15:40):**  what inspired Fiona to look at a new business model for their farm.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:15:45):**  We were looking at our local community, Tullamore, which is really struggling to stay afloat,  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:15:51):**  really. You know, it's always to have a little shop or all that sort of stuff. It's just  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:15:55):**  a battle for everybody to, the population isn't really here to sustain it. We used to  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:16:00):**  be a three teacher primary school and then they had to drop down to a two teacher and  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:16:05):**  we'll just thinking about that and just going, gosh, I wonder what the future is. And it's  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:16:09):**  a pity we don't have any industry and all that sort of thing. And part of it is that  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:16:15):**  as farms, you know, through the factory farming year and the age of mechanisation and all  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:16:21):**  that sort of thing, we've all expanded, we've all got bigger equipment, we've all bought  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:16:25):**  out our neighbours as they've moved on and that type of thing. So we're all running pretty  
**[0:16:30-0:16:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:16:30):**  big properties. But then in terms of the community, there's less people that you don't have the  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:16:37):**  workmen, people are having less kids probably. I mean, we have four, but most people would  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:16:42):**  have two or three. And it just, you reach a point in the community where you wonder  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:16:46):**  if it's sustainable and it's like, well, we can't keep buying properties and getting bigger  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:16:50):**  and bigger because we can't do the work. And as time goes on, you miss the old quality  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:16:56):**  of life. You know, everyone always says about living in regional areas, it's the lifestyle.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:17:00):**  We love the lifestyle. When you're working seven days a week and really long hours, you're  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:17:05):**  going, well, the lifestyle kind of sucks at the moment. So we were just sort of thinking  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:17:10):**  about how that was going and what it would look like for the next generation. We had  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:17:14):**  a bit of a family meeting and my husband had just gone through their family succession,  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:17:20):**  which worked really well. And it's held up to be a great example where the boys had always  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:17:24):**  known what they were getting is has a sister who's off farm and she'd always known what  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:17:28):**  she was getting. And it worked brilliantly that nobody fell out and everything was good.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:17:34):**  But each of the boys have gone on to lease or purchase additional country. And it's again,  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:17:40):**  it's unlike, is it really like, is it the great answer? Because what, you know, where  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:17:46):**  do we want to live and what do we want to live in in the next 20 or 30 years? Or, you  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:17:50):**  know, what, what are our children going to live in? And I just thought, well, maybe we  
**[0:17:54-0:18:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:17:54):**  should do more of a value add to the country and what we're producing and create jobs within  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:18:01):**  the farm, like vertically rather than horizontally. So that if the kids want to have work on the  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:18:06):**  farm when they're older, we don't have to buy another property and, you know, borrow  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:18:10):**  all that money and do that sort of thing. Maybe we've got the opportunity within the  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:18:14):**  farm already to create business and jobs and that would have a benefit not just for our  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:18:19):**  immediate family, but for the community and at large.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:18:23):**  When you were thinking about that, did you find yourself, were you like the crazy uncle  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:18:26):**  that's like thinking totally differently or was everyone kind of on board? Was it a thought  
**[0:18:30-0:18:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:18:30):**  you shared with anyone?  
**[0:18:32-0:18:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:18:32):**  Yeah, no, Bill and I talked about it at length and we, you know, were chewing over it from  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:18:40):**  for many, many evenings and car trips and, you know, what can we do? And, and I was like,  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:18:45):**  well, I reckon with the lambs, there's a great opportunity, you know, we can do a value add  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:18:49):**  and we've always like, we do live in a bubble and I say this all the time in regional areas.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:18:54):**  Like I'm, I kind of had a feeling that people would be interested in the story and that  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:19:00):**  was part of us as well of wanting to do Outback Lamb was that we get, farmers get such a bad  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:19:06):**  rap from vegans and environmentalists and people who just think we're the worst environmental  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:19:12):**  vandals and cruel to our animals and do all these terrible things. And most people love  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:19:17):**  their animals and do, you know, would, if they was an animal in distress and it was  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:19:21):**  nearly dark, they wouldn't leave it. Like they'd go out and catch it and bring it back  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:19:26):**  in and treat it and do all that. They'd look after animals before they'd look after themselves.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:19:31):**  And yet the general public don't seem to recognize that or acknowledge it. And whenever there's,  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:19:36):**  you know, something in the media, it's always about how we're mistreating the animals or  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:19:41):**  cruel or doing, pushing down trees or doing all this sort of stuff. And it was like, I  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:19:47):**  really think that if people knew the story that they would be so much more connected  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:19:51):**  to the land and, and their food source and just to understand it a bit better and be  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:19:56):**  a bit kinder about what they think. And we had a lot of backpackers coming through the  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:20:00):**  place as well. So we, I was sort of telling the stories to them as they were coming through  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:20:05):**  and they were going, Oh, but isn't organic much better? And I'm like, well organic is  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:20:09):**  much better, but sometimes organic, it just means that people have taken chemical out  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:20:13):**  of the equation. It doesn't mean that they're addressing everything else. And I said in  
**[0:20:17-0:20:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:20:17):**  the same way that a good farmer might be doing everything else really well, but some glyphosate  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:20:24):**  at an opportune time might be a great solution, even though it's not something that they will  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:20:28):**  use all the time, but they don't qualify as organic, even though the food might be more  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:20:34):**  nutritious than its organic counterpart, if it's not managed properly. And as they lived  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:20:40):**  here and worked here for ages and really got to see how things were done, they, they developed  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:20:45):**  a greater understanding and it made us want to share that a bit, a bit more widely.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:20:51):**  And what was the first time where you like took a step? You were like, okay, I'm going  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:20:55):**  to go from these concepts and this belief and passion to like Brandon Lamb and sausage  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:21:01):**  rolls, like, like take us forward to when you actually decided to do something and what  
**[0:21:04-0:21:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:21:04):**  that was like.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:21:05):**  Well, I think I Googled a lot of stuff and I was like, right, I'll do a business plan.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:21:10):**  That'll be a great idea. And, um, anyway, I've got about three quarters of the legs  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:21:13):**  for the business plan and I was like, Oh, this kind of sucks. I think I'll just start  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:21:18):**  it and see how it goes. And we went, I had a meeting with, um, a great fellow in Dubbo  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:21:24):**  who has a business called Principal Focus and they were so generous with their time.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:21:28):**  Bill and I went and saw them and I just said, look, I'm thinking of starting this paddock  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:21:31):**  to plate business. What do you, you know, what do you think? Blah, blah, blah. And we  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:21:34):**  sat down with them and had a massive three hour conversation and they'd done a lot of  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:21:39):**  research and talk just through a lot of things. And one of, and it was his suggestion. He  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:21:44):**  said, well, whatever you do, don't call it West Point Lamb. West Point being the farm  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:21:47):**  name. And he said, cause that means nothing to anybody. He said, call it something. And  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:21:52):**  we developed Outback Lamb then as a company because I didn't want it to just be something  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:21:56):**  that we started and then it disappeared into consolidated revenue and nothing ever happened  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:22:01):**  again. I thought if it had its own entity, then I'd be a little more driven and focused  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:22:06):**  about getting it up and running.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:22:09):**  One of the best pieces of advice that Fiona got when she was starting Outback Lamb was  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:22:13):**  during a course that she took. The course was actually more about the farm business,  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:22:17):**  but the instructor told her something that would prove quite pivotal for Fiona.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:22:21):**  I remember him saying, you don't need a lot of capital to start up. And this work for  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:22:26):**  me was a real, a little bit of an epiphany because I was thinking, Oh God, I've made  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:22:30):**  you 10 or 15 grand to get a webpage and blah, blah, blah. And after talking to the guys  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:22:35):**  at Principal Focus, it was, you know, we need like 10,000 hits before you can get one sale  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:22:40):**  and you know, looking at all those stats. And then he said, Oh, well why don't you do,  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:22:47):**  you know, you can just start up like do it. You can get a webpage, you can do weeks or  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:22:52):**  something like that. Pay a month for subscription and it doesn't have to cost you the earth.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:22:56):**  You can build it yourself. And I was like, Oh yeah. And then I thought about a bit of  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:23:00):**  a logo and I talked to a girlfriend I went to uni with and I was like, you know, rip  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:23:05):**  something off the internet and I was like, can you make this enough different that it  
**[0:23:09-0:23:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:23:09):**  can be mine? And we just kind of meandered along, I guess basically in terms of right  
**[0:23:17-0:23:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:23:17):**  I need a brand, right I need a webpage. Okay. Then I went and spoke to a couple of butchers.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:23:23):**  There was a, an abattoir. So a lot of things happened. Opportunity. There was a micro avatar  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:23:28):**  opened up at Tenandra where we could get minimum kills done. Like you didn't need a minimum,  
**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:23:34):**  sorry. Like you just get any, anything done. So that was a great starting point for us.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:23:38):**  It was quite expensive, but it was a great way to dip our toe in the market. So doing  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:23:43):**  the whole bodies and they would do the butchering, box it all up and then we could pick it up  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:23:48):**  and get it delivered to the people that were buying it on the online store.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:23:53):**  After getting stuck in and getting going, Fiona had a few tough decisions to make.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:23:57):**  A lot of people asked us if we were going to do farmer's markets and that type of thing,  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:24:01):**  but we were very conscious early on that we didn't want to make another job for ourselves  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:24:06):**  in just, you know, have another, we really wanted to go into whole bodies and, and be  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:24:12):**  more wholesale, but have our own brand attached to us and the, that prominence that it was  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:24:17):**  grown and bred here. And we can do all that kind of thing ourselves.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:24:22):**  But of course, like any startup, getting Outback Lamb off the ground was not easy. Fiona had  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:24:27):**  to challenge herself to learn new skills and to get out of her comfort zone.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:24:31):**  I struggled a lot with social media in the early days. It's a bit hard to get over yourself  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:24:37):**  early on where you just like, Oh God, I saw much such a tool and you just don't want to  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:24:43):**  put things out there and you're a little bit embarrassed. But then I was talking to a friend  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:24:48):**  and she's like, well, when do you ever look at somebody's post and go, Oh God, they're  
**[0:24:52-0:24:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:24:52):**  such a tool. And I was like, well, I never actually, I never do. So that was, and you  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:24:59):**  just, it's yesterday's news, you know, you put it up and it's, you know, you think, Oh  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:25:03):**  God, I saw much an idiot, but anyway, and tomorrow I'll put something new up and it'll  
**[0:25:07-0:25:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:25:07):**  be gone. So I just practiced and just got into it and just, yeah, got over myself really.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:25:16):**  It's so funny. Like it's just like any startup and all the same pitfalls, like we should  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:25:21):**  start with a business plan or we have to spend tens of thousands of dollars. Those are really  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:25:24):**  common myths, whether you're a farmer starting a business or a tech person starting a business  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:25:29):**  and they're not true either way, which is always interesting to see those parallels.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:25:33):**  Yeah, no, it was absolutely that. And then sort of early on, we've got a little bit of  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:25:40):**  traction early on and it was going quite well. And I said to Bill, I think they might get  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:25:45):**  like somebody in the, like a Mark Holmes kind of a person on board to really help out in  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:25:50):**  terms of just tidying up the webpage. And it was, I was happy with it. It was good,  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:25:54):**  but it wasn't great. You know, like it was my first effort, so you can imagine what it  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:25:59):**  was like, but it was clear and I knew what I was saying, but I needed more, just a bit  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:26:05):**  more spit and polish on everything. And so there was a lady in Dubbo that who'd been  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:26:10):**  recommended to me and she came on board for three months and she just like cracked the  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:26:14):**  whip and really got me into gear in terms of getting a bit more of a plan with the social  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:26:19):**  media. She got me doing the recipe blog and getting sort of the idea of being to offer  
**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:26:26):**  more than just, you know, this is our outback lamb, it's better than other lamb, I promise,  
**[0:26:32-0:26:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:26:32):**  to try and get people to, to give them more than just the lamb. So we're doing the recipe  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:26:38):**  blogs fortnightly, I was doing quarterly EMAG with just news and stories on the farm and  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:26:43):**  we're doing the social media kind of stuff and just trying to, just connecting generally  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:26:47):**  with the public and the people that were interested in what we were doing and she was great. So  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:26:52):**  that gave me a lot more focus and a bit more drive and definitely lifted our profile.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:26:58):**  Building a strong social media profile helped Outback Lamb to get started and to attract  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:27:03):**  some customers. It also led to other opportunities for Fiona, like being invited to participate  
**[0:27:08-0:27:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:27:08):**  in a business course.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:27:10):**  Regional Platters in Dubbo, which is a combination of a few shy councils, but to promote the  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:27:17):**  region as food producers. And they did like a business and social media course that went  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:27:23):**  on for three months and we popped in every couple of weeks type thing. And the culmination  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:27:28):**  of that was that we had to do a pitch and we had to have a project. So I collaborated  
**[0:27:34-0:27:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:27:34):**  with the gourmet goat lady at Coli and Farmer Browns Pastured Eggs at Wellington. And we  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:27:41):**  did a pitch to say that we really wanted to get a refrigerated truck. So we'd take our  
**[0:27:45-0:27:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:27:45):**  full body sheep and goats and the eggs into the Sydney markets and we won that. So that  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:27:52):**  was a $15,000 boost to the kitty. So then we proceeded to get a little refrigerator  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:27:58):**  truck, which we drive now and that has really helped to grow the business as well. So just  
**[0:28:02-0:28:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:28:02):**  the publicity we got from that, but also the cash and let us get a really good quality  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:28:08):**  truck.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:28:09):**  There's such a good theme there of the combination of do it yourself and get started and that  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:28:16):**  kind of hustle with really strong partnerships and surrounding yourself with good people  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:28:20):**  because you did that both with the initial advice and with the help with the website  
**[0:28:25-0:28:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:28:25):**  and then with the partnerships there. It takes a village to raise a child, same with a startup,  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:28:31):**  but also you have to put in the hard work yourself and it sounds like you've done both.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:28:37):**  As I said, it is hard because you're coming from a point of pretty much zero knowledge,  
**[0:28:42-0:28:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:28:42):**  but you can pretty much Google anything that I've discovered. So you just find out and  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:28:49):**  if you can see a gap in your business or something's not quite right or whatever, then you can  
**[0:28:53-0:29:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:28:53):**  usually find somebody that is an expert in that area or source out that information.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:29:01):**  The hardest thing sometimes is spotting the gaps and that's where Farmers to Founders  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:29:05):**  was quite good because when you're working in that bubble and you're just moving forward  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:29:11):**  all the time, sometimes you don't stop and think, why did I choose that or why am I doing  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:29:15):**  that? You don't give it enough thought, you're just progressing all the time. So Farmers  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:29:19):**  to Founders for me was a great opportunity to sit back and look at the business from  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:29:24):**  a bird's eye view and go, well now why am I doing that? What am I trying to get to?  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:29:30):**  Now that we've done this, what does that tell me and how can I get to the next point and  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:29:35):**  that type of thing? So that was a wonderful opportunity that I don't think you could do  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:29:39):**  on your own.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:29:40):**  One of the aspects of the Farmers to Founders bootcamp program, especially for the teams  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:29:44):**  doing value-add products like Fiona, is a focus on the macro trends that are driving  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:29:49):**  today's consumers. Learning about these trends has inspired Fiona to make some changes to  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:29:54):**  Outback Lamp.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:29:55):**  Our business is whole body carcasses into Dubbo, Sydney and Wollongong. That's what  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:30:01):**  we do. But in order to build on that brand, we try and have a presence at local events  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:30:06):**  and festivals and that type of thing when the opportunity arises. So we did a Beers  
**[0:30:12-0:30:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:30:12):**  to the Bush Festival in Dubbo last year and I was thinking, oh gosh, what could we have  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:30:18):**  with a beer? I know, I'll do a lamb sausage roll. So we went to a local baker and I was  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:30:22):**  like, if I bring the lamb, can we do like a gourmet sausage roll? And I think we did  
**[0:30:26-0:30:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:30:26):**  lamb, harissa and almond. Honestly, it was so easy. I dropped the lamb off, we mucked  
**[0:30:34-0:30:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:30:34):**  around with the recipe for half the morning and then we cooked them up and it was like,  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:30:37):**  yeah, that's good. All right, I'll bring some more lamb next week and we'll have 500 for  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:30:42):**  the festival. That'll be great. And that was literally how easy, how much effort we put  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:30:47):**  into it. And they were a huge hit. So people really liked them. And when we did other festivals,  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:30:53):**  there was Trundlebush Tuckaday and there was a Jimmy Barnes concert at Tullamore. So we  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:30:58):**  did the sausage rolls as well. We did other stuff. We did lamb cofters and I'm trying  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:31:03):**  to think what else we've done. Anyway, all like different sort of foods, but the sausage  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:31:07):**  rolls were always popular and people were asking for them outside of those events and  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:31:12):**  you know, can we put in an order and all that sort of thing. So when the Farmers to Founders  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:31:17):**  came up and part of what we want to do with the lamb is really, we'll maximize our return,  
**[0:31:22-0:31:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:31:22):**  I guess is the focus, but it's about using all of the animal. So we were like, you know,  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:31:28):**  we can do bone broths and we can do sausage rolls and you know, how do we manage all of  
**[0:31:32-0:31:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:31:32):**  that type of thing? So we just went with the sausage rolls and to do that with, when we  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:31:39):**  got to Farmers to Founders, they're like, well, you know, have you thought about doing  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:31:43):**  something that's preservative free? And I was like, well, I hadn't, no. And when we  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:31:47):**  talked about all those mega trends and things that are happening in the world and what people  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:31:51):**  are looking for and about that, you know, what would make somebody eat a sausage roll  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:31:55):**  and that type of thing. Well, the preservative free really jumped out at me as something  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:32:01):**  that we could do to differentiate what we're doing and connect with that sort of artisanal  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:32:06):**  market and that patticoat plate sort of theme that we're already building on. And then the  
**[0:32:11-0:32:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:32:11):**  other thing was looking at the mega trends and it was more the snackability, like how,  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:32:18):**  when would people eat a sausage roll and all that sort of thing and what size do they have  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:32:22):**  to be? And we were doing quite more massive, big, long sausage rolls for the festivals.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:32:28):**  And so we've fine tuned that and made them a little bit smaller.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:32:33):**  I love it. Snackable. It's such a big trend actually. And like everything is snackable  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:32:38):**  now and it's like cute and bite size and you can have a little baby one and especially  
**[0:32:42-0:32:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:32:42):**  things that are more indulgent, like something that's otherwise maybe seen as not something  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:32:49):**  you eat every day or it's a bit of a treat or it's indulgent, like having a small one,  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:32:53):**  it's like, oh, it doesn't count. Well, my kids love them. They have them as afternoon  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:32:58):**  tea when they come home and that's exactly, so I want them to have something but not ruin  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:33:02):**  their dinner, if that makes sense. So I was like, yeah, well that definitely works for  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:33:06):**  me. So we'll do something like that. And also that, you know, when do you eat sausage rolls?  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:33:12):**  Well, they're always great at a party, you know, that five o'clock sees having a beer  
**[0:33:16-0:33:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:33:16):**  and a sausage roll or, you know, when people pop around for drinks in the Friday afternoon,  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:33:20):**  that type of thing. So we're just really, yeah, it just made me try and think about  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:33:25):**  how we might see into that market and what people were interested in.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:33:30):**  So with all these changes, what's up next for Fiona and for Outback Lamb and what does  
**[0:33:34-0:33:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:33:34):**  the future hold?  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:33:36):**  Well, I guess in terms of our next plans, hopefully we'll launch the sausage rolls in  
**[0:33:42-0:33:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:33:42):**  the next month is what I'm really gearing towards now. And then in the, and this is  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:33:50):**  drought breaking and, you know, a whole heap of other provisos, but I'd dearly love to  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:33:54):**  either develop a microbrewery on the farm or close by that we could utilise. I'd like  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:34:01):**  to do it in a community like Parks or Dubbo, somewhere close to the Inland Railway line,  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:34:07):**  because I think that there'll be a lot of other farmers that would like to do similar  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:34:12):**  things and to have access to a little micro abattoir would be a great asset to a small  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:34:18):**  community. And in that way, we can really then own all of the animal. We can really  
**[0:34:23-0:34:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:34:23):**  try to find markets for the offal and the, I can develop bone broths and do that type  
**[0:34:31-0:34:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:34:31):**  of thing and really get to a point where the whole animal is utilised really well. So it's  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:34:38):**  the whole animal and how we can really maximise the return for it.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:34:42):**  At first I thought you said microbrewery.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:34:45):**  I think I said microbrewery. I was like, oh shit.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:34:48):**  And then I was like, oh, this is really gone to left field.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:34:51):**  Yeah. I think I did say microbrewery. It's clearly, it's clearly five o'clock isn't it?  
**[0:34:57-0:35:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:34:57):**  No, micro abattoir. That's what I meant to say.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:35:00):**  Oh my gosh. Too funny. I was like, well, I'm going to be your first customer, but not to  
**[0:35:04-0:35:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:35:04):**  the abattoir, just to the brewery.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:35:06):**  Bill, my husband, Bill loves beer. So he would be all over a brewery if we, he's like, can  
**[0:35:12-0:35:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:35:12):**  you make beer from land?  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:35:17):**  Maybe last question, Fiona, what, um, would you have any advice for another farmer who's  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:35:22):**  thinking about maybe having a go with an idea and maybe is in that stage of feeling like  
**[0:35:27-0:35:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:35:27):**  it's too hard to get started or they're the crazy uncle, um, with, with just not their  
**[0:35:31-0:35:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:35:31):**  idea. What, what advice would you have?  
**[0:35:34-0:35:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:35:34):**  I think that I would actually say just get in and do it. Like it's, you won't, like you  
**[0:35:41-0:35:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:35:41):**  won't know unless you try. So it's, I guess I just feel like agriculture is really changing  
**[0:35:48-0:35:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:35:48):**  that the, you know, these eras of productivity and expansion and where in order to increase  
**[0:35:57-0:36:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:35:57):**  your profits, you increase the, what your carrying capacity is and all that sort of  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:36:00):**  stuff and you do pasture improvement. But I just feel like it for us anyway, in this  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:36:05):**  where we don't have irrigation and we're more, we're not marginal country at all, but we  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:36:10):**  are marginal rainfall and it's really important that we're on the lighter end of stocking  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:36:16):**  rates and all that sort of thing. And we've got to look after our soils and we've got  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:36:20):**  to look after to have a future in agriculture of what we do. It needs to be, we need to  
**[0:36:25-0:36:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:36:25):**  be making better returns on what we're producing. We need to basically make more from less.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:36:32):**  And that's how agriculture has to change. And that's what we're trying to do here at  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:36:37):**  Outback Lamb. And I think that surely it's not just us that think that, I think that  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:36:42):**  other people would be seeing the same things and you know, the pressure you put your country  
**[0:36:46-0:36:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:36:46):**  under to try and make ends meet is just not, it's not a sustainable option. And we, you  
**[0:36:53-0:36:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:36:53):**  know, the opportunities that come from the regenerative ag portion and how people are  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:36:59):**  really looking at their soil health. And we're in a great position because we are mixed farming.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:37:04):**  So it's that benefit of grazing and producing meat. And it's just so it works really well.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:37:12):**  And the cropping is obviously a big component of our income, but it's like you know, living  
**[0:37:17-0:37:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:37:17):**  in a banana republic, if we keep mining our country and trying to put it back in, in terms  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:37:24):**  with artificial fertilisers and using chemicals and all that sort of stuff, then it will ultimately  
**[0:37:29-0:37:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:37:29):**  deplete. Like we can see that already. So we need to change what we're doing. And I  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:37:33):**  always say to the kids, it's a bit like living off McDonald's, you can get the calories you  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:37:38):**  need, but you don't get the nutrition. And that's the kind of farming that we're heading  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:37:42):**  towards. So that's why we need to stop and rethink that and change. And that's what I'd  
**[0:37:47-0:37:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:37:47):**  say to other people is, you know, what sort of farm do you want to have? And how can you  
**[0:37:51-0:37:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:37:51):**  change your business to make that?  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:37:54):**  You can tell by the confidence in Fiona's voice that she's come a long way and that  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:37:58):**  she really believes in what she's doing with Outback Lamb. It's not easy for any entrepreneur  
**[0:38:03-0:38:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:38:03):**  to keep this conviction, especially when you're starting a new business, and let alone during  
**[0:38:08-0:38:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:38:08):**  a drought when everything feels like an uphill battle. And Fiona says it's not always easy,  
**[0:38:13-0:38:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:38:13):**  and she's not always confident, but that hasn't stopped her.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:38:16):**  As I said, like, honestly, I feel like I'm sure everyone's the same, but you mill around  
**[0:38:22-0:38:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:38:22):**  aimlessly and the fear of fear of fraud or, you know, there's some special talk, you're  
**[0:38:28-0:38:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:38:28):**  like, I'm really not the expert, but I'll tell you, you know, I can talk about what  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:38:31):**  I can talk about, because that's what I know. But I wouldn't be so vain to think that I'm  
**[0:38:37-0:38:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:38:37):**  absolutely right. But I can, it's the direction that we've chosen, because I think that I  
**[0:38:44-0:38:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:38:44):**  can see there's a need for change. I don't know what the answers are, but this is, you  
**[0:38:47-0:38:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:38:47):**  know, we can't just keep doing what we're doing, we've got to change.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:38:51):**  Yeah, so true and so hard to get started, but that's really all you can do, right, is  
**[0:38:55-0:39:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:38:55):**  take that first step. So I'm just continue to be impressed and humbled by stories like  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:39:01):**  yours and the tough times you're facing, but how positive and forward looking and innovative  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:39:06):**  you are, because it's definitely not easy, and it's really hard to understand from the  
**[0:39:10-0:39:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:39:10):**  outside. So yeah, just appreciate you sharing the story.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:39:14):**  I know you guys have been amazing. It is honestly to give you such a lift, like to apply for  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:39:19):**  something like Farmers to Founders and then to be selected, you feel like you feel like  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:39:23):**  you've won a little bit of lottery, like it's like, oh, I really like what I'm doing, you  
**[0:39:27-0:39:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:39:27):**  know, like you, it gives you a lift because you just think otherwise, you know, unless  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:39:31):**  you're doing things like that, you're like, oh, it seemed like a good idea at the time,  
**[0:39:36-0:39:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:39:36):**  but how are we, you know, is it is it and it and it's a crazy time to be trying to evaluate  
**[0:39:42-0:39:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:39:42):**  the lands because the drought has meant that the lands increase in value exponentially  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:39:48):**  because of the basically supply and demand. Like it's, it's like, I don't even know why  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:39:54):**  I'm trying to value add because I could just take them an extra two weeks and add them  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:39:57):**  to the, and put them in the sale yards. But anyway, we've got a, we've got a plan and  
**[0:40:01-0:40:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:40:01):**  we're sticking with it.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:40:02):**  Yep. And yeah, like I said, you got to start somewhere and it's, I mean, startups are like,  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:40:08):**  you know, experimenting and trying new things, seeing what's working. So you're definitely  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:40:12):**  on that journey.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=562386#t=0:40:13):**  Thank you.

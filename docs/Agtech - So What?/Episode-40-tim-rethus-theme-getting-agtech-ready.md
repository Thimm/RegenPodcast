### Agtech - So What?  (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 02:45:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly changing  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:00:25):**  the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting started.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:00:30):**  But there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between ag and  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:00:35):**  ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring you the  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:00:39):**  story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where ag and tech  
**[0:00:44-0:01:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:00:44):**  meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:01:01):**  Today's episode is the first of four episodes where we'll focus on the theme of getting  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:01:06):**  ag tech ready. This theme is brought to you in partnership with Decipher. We'll be exploring  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:01:12):**  what it really means to be ag tech ready. We'll be looking at this from four different  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:01:16):**  perspectives starting today with a really innovative farmer named Tim. Then we'll summarize  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:01:21):**  the insights from each of the episode in a blog post that goes beyond the show notes  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:01:25):**  that we've been doing thus far and an ebook for the theme with all the insights from those  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:01:30):**  four episodes. To kick off this theme, today's episode features Tim Rethis. Tim gives his  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:01:36):**  background right when we start recording. I won't say more by way of introduction other  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:01:40):**  than that Tim is very much an early adopter and innovator. In fact, he's pushing the envelope  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:01:45):**  so much that when he first mentions the planter that they've built, I didn't even realize  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:01:50):**  that it was something they had designed and built. It took me two more questions before  
**[0:01:54-0:02:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:01:54):**  I circled back to dig into what it actually meant to build something quite that innovative.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:02:01):**  I learned a ton about what it means to get ag tech ready in this episode with Tim and  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:02:05):**  I hope you will too. As always, if you like what you're hearing, please subscribe to the

**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:02:14):**  it for me. Here's Tim.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:02:15):**  We'll start off with where we're Victorian farmers. We're a full cropping farmers. It's  
**[0:02:20-0:02:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:02:20):**  all winter crops only. Winter rainfall dominate. It's very hot and dry in summer. Usually it's  
**[0:02:27-0:02:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:02:27):**  nothing green in summer and then go for it between April and November harvesting in November,  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:02:34):**  but we have been here since... I'm only third generation in this area. I'm pretty sure my  
**[0:02:40-0:02:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:02:40):**  grandpa and his grandpa were probably farmers too. We've been working with some novel methods  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:02:47):**  here. We've got a reasonably large farm which allows us to play with a few toys. We've got  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:02:51):**  a lot of control traffic and novel machines, a lot of them new to keep up to date and to  
**[0:02:55-0:03:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:02:55):**  keep reliability up. Myself, I grew up on the farm obviously. I went to university and  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:03:02):**  I liked doing chemistry. I became a chemical engineer. I went to a university and did chemical  
**[0:03:08-0:03:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:03:08):**  engineering and I did a dual degree with management commerce in there as well. From that, I progressed  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:03:16):**  to getting a job at an oil refinery as an engineer and working on problems there. Engineers  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:03:21):**  are just generally troubleshooters. We just find problems and solve them. Six years ago,  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:03:27):**  I decided to have one of those midlife crises. I came back home and my uncle was retiring  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:03:32):**  and my dad and uncle had been working together. My uncle was retiring so I came in and stepped  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:03:37):**  in and filled in his role and worked with my father on the farm. Then the year after  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:03:42):**  that, my little brother came back and he's a telecommunications engineer. He went to  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:03:45):**  university and studied telecommunications. We've come back and essentially taking over  
**[0:03:51-0:03:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:03:51):**  the operation now. We're a large farm in our area. My brother, myself, my dad is still  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:03:59):**  working on the farm and we have two full-time farmhands. That's been going now for farmhands.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:04:05):**  My first farmhand has been around for 15 years so I must be doing something right. It's going  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:04:09):**  quite well.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:04:10):**  Interesting. A couple of themes in there I wanted to tease out. One was the controlled  
**[0:04:14-0:04:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:04:14):**  traffic. Tell me about when you guys decided to start farming in that way and what the  
**[0:04:21-0:04:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:04:21):**  benefits were. Was it a slow decision? Could you dip in a toe in the water or was it kind  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:04:24):**  of jump in and really switch to that kind of what really is a farming system?  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:04:29):**  You could pack it away tomorrow or you could pack it away now and it's done. You start  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:04:32):**  getting the benefits of it being packed away. It's the same with the farming. It's like  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:04:36):**  if you're going to do this and you have the means to do it and we had to change some gear  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:04:40):**  anyway, why wouldn't you start reaping the benefits immediately? We could see that in  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:04:44):**  what we were looking at our crops with the unevenness of them. It was pretty much get  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:04:48):**  in early and do it because we could see what was going to happen. There was no necessary  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:04:52):**  business case put together but it was quite clearly formed in your mind. You could probably  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:04:56):**  write one quite easily but you knew what was going to happen and it's one of those no brainer  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:05:01):**  kind of decisions.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:05:02):**  Yeah, it's interesting. There's a lot of talk I guess about the ag tech companies need to  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:05:07):**  show their ROI to farmers and do the business case but my experience and definitely chatting  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:05:13):**  to people in places like the podcast has been that it's much more like you described it  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:05:16):**  that it kind of either fully makes sense or doesn't and if it doesn't I might stick a  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:05:20):**  toe in the water but if it fully makes sense then I'll go for it. Is that consistent with  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:05:25):**  your experience?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:05:26):**  Yeah, I think the key thing is Sarah, is you got to have a very clear path of where you  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:05:30):**  want to go and so in this case dad knew that well we need to reduce soil compaction. How  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:05:36):**  do I do that? He'd already been doing things to retain stubble to store moisture and that  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:05:41):**  sort of thing and it's like where do we go to next? There's a bit of research about when  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:05:44):**  you enter the distance and what type of distance and who are but you kind of have this vision  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:05:48):**  of what I want is control traffic and I know what I want to do and you essentially do every  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:05:54):**  decision you do from now on to finally achieve that goal in the end and so you may not get  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:05:58):**  it all right in one year because you mightn't be able to afford changing all of your gear  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:02):**  in one season which is unlikely but at least you know that next time you buy a tractor  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:06):**  you'll make sure that it's on three meter centres because that's where you want to be  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:09):**  even if it's not useful now and so you're constantly working towards that whereas I  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:13):**  think sometimes people that they want the proof but when you've already made the mind  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:18):**  it's a bit like the argument between Toby Hine and self-propelled sprayers both have  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:23):**  very good business cases but it really comes down to which one the farmer really wants  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:27):**  and then they will justify it with the best business case and it's a bit like this once  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:30):**  you've made up your mind you want to do it you'll commit to it properly but if you're  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:33):**  not if you're sort of wishy-washy about it you're going to take a lot more to get yourself  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:37):**  across the line because you've really got to be convinced that you're wrong and people  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:40):**  don't like that.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:41):**  And is that something that was transparent to you mentioned there's a couple farm managers  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:44):**  and obviously you and your brother maybe weren't making the decision at that time was this  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:48):**  kind of we know where we're going and this is a shift we want to make was that transparent  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:52):**  to everyone or was it kind of dad was thinking that and then once it happened like it's sort  
**[0:06:56-0:06:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:56):**  of transparent in hindsight?  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:06:57):**  I think it comes down to how you structure your business so yeah we've kind of got three  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:07:00):**  managers and our farm hand who's been here so long he's essentially part of the team  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:07:04):**  management team anyway but back then it was pretty much dad and and my uncle was was on  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:07:09):**  the mechanical side so he was pretty much the executioner he got stuff done and dad  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:07:13):**  was the one who was guiding where that where everything was was heading and my uncle's  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:07:17):**  quite happy with that so it's about sectioning yourself into where you think your strengths  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:07:20):**  are and so my uncle was really good at keeping everything going and making sure that we had  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:07:24):**  the tools to do the job and you know making sure that they all looked after properly but  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:07:27):**  then dad likes that business management side of things he was into that and so now that  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:07:31):**  we've got the three of us we've all sort of fractured into our groups to sort of I'm the  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:07:34):**  crop manager I look after growing stuff my brother looks after the marketing of the goods  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:07:39):**  we have the logistics of getting it away so we kind of don't necessarily tread on each  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:07:43):**  other's toes too much we communicate with each other but we don't want to be that you  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:07:47):**  you don't necessarily have to have a unanimous decision it's about you convincing the others  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:07:50):**  that you're right and they should believe you because that's your expertise kind of  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:07:53):**  thing you know but other farms don't work that way it's sort of a bit everyone does  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:07:56):**  everything yeah sure interesting and lots of parallels to business right and whether  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:08:01):**  you kind of have a team with diverse skill sets or you want to narrowly focus in one  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:08:04):**  area and you know farms are businesses and so it makes sense it really depends like if  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:08:08):**  two guys really like looking after the crops so then you have to come with a different  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:08:12):**  model but for us it works quite well because I'm quite interested in that and that and  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:08:16):**  I that means I look for innovations in that area and I'll be explaining stuff like with  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:08:20):**  it my brother looks after the seeder and so we know what we want to achieve and then he  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:08:25):**  goes and finds solutions to try and solve that on his side for his gear and he'll say  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:08:29):**  oh I think this is what we should do and go fine if you think that'll work we'll run with  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:08:33):**  that but we've both got a clear idea of where we're heading we're not doing two different  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:08:36):**  divergent management strategies we're the same way it's just that one personal you know  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:08:41):**  focus their attention in a particular area to make sure the research done is done properly  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:08:44):**  and you've got a it's so much information to take in you really need to immerse yourself  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:08:48):**  in it and it's hard to immerse yourself in in aspects when farming has so many different  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:08:51):**  aspects you could be an expert at yeah I want to ask your advice like you've mentioned a  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:08:55):**  few times kind of we knew where we wanted to go so then we went and researched or we  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:08:59):**  were looking for innovations or you know I was looking for something or my brother was  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:09:02):**  like where do you look and how do you like has where you looked changed or like our information  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:09:07):**  sources equally as trusted is it more research or kind of like marketing you know trade shows  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:09:12):**  kind of where do you look for this stuff yeah it's really tricky and it definitely is changing  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:09:15):**  like right now the easiest way to look is on twitter that's the the farmers medium is  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:09:19):**  is twitter it's a great place to look for novel ideas so I guess where we are in our  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:09:23):**  business I'd say we're early adopters so we're looking for new options that are going to  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:09:27):**  opportunities that are going to get us towards our final goal of a sustainable low-cost farm  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:09:32):**  and that that means that you know you're looking kind of beyond the bulk so you can't just  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:09:38):**  look at the neighbors because they're probably not doing it yet so you're trying to find  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:09:41):**  something outside your your zone of influence so you're looking at you know a different  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:09:45):**  agricultural region or a different industry even looking for a solution that might solve  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:09:49):**  a little problem so you're trying to think really laterally and so things like twitter  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:09:52):**  are great because people throw ideas and it may not necessarily be necessarily be perfect  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:09:56):**  for your area but you might be able to adapt it to make sure it is and and that's the clever  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:10:00):**  thing is trying to find these little things that you just tweaking it oh that I could  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:10:04):**  just do this that would be perfect and that's where even with a lot of these digital tools  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:10:08):**  it's trying to understand which is going to be the best fit for you you know you're just  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:10:12):**  looking through all these resources yeah so it's one of the things that strikes me is  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:10:16):**  like when you've named the people in your family like dad's an early adopter and and  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:10:19):**  you know my brother has these skills my uncle's mechanical and I have engineering and commerce  
**[0:10:23-0:10:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:10:23):**  like did you guys strategically decide you were going to build all these skills like  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:10:26):**  because I imagine you know some farms wouldn't have all those skills in house they might  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:10:29):**  have to outsource some and so does does the skill sets that you guys have had I think  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:10:33):**  so and I think that's where it's complementary but at the same point I think you identify  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:10:37):**  what the people are good at and that those are the aspects of your business that you  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:10:41):**  really enhance so you look at your business and we say look we're quite good with digital  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:10:45):**  tools because my brother did telecommunications really he's got a really good feel and understanding  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:10:49):**  on how these things work and so we're not afraid to go into that phase you don't have  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:10:53):**  to go and do those things you might say I'm really good at driving trucks so I'm just  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:10:57):**  going to do a lot of truck work and I'm just going to focus on you know contracting out  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:01):**  or something like that and that's what you do or you might build cheap you might use  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:05):**  old gear but you can keep it going because you're so good with your mechanical ability  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:08):**  whereas you know we tend to just sort of once it gets long in the tooth we just change it  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:12):**  over and get a new one you know we don't we don't like trying to keep something going  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:15):**  we just like the reliability because that's not in our focus so it's where you choose  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:19):**  to position your strength and there's not much point trying to force somebody to do  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:22):**  something they're not very good at and the classic is sheep you know you've got mixed  
**[0:11:26-0:11:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:26):**  farms if you don't really like doing sheep you might as well just stick to your crops  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:29):**  because you can do a better job than be forced to look after some sheep and it's the same  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:33):**  if you're a great sheep farmer you're not going to grow great crops if you love sheep  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:37):**  more than your crops you know so there's always that compromise and you've got to identify  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:40):**  your strengths and play to them.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:42):**  Yeah interesting so I want to go back to the Twitter example because I love that do you  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:45):**  have an example of something that you like found on Twitter and like and or examples  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:51):**  of stuff you've used from other industries because I think both of those are kind of  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:54):**  nuances of how to find technology that maybe aren't obvious to other people.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:11:57):**  Yeah yeah I guess so like with the planter we have a lot of aftermarket things we put  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:12:02):**  on there and there's not a lot of planters around here this is a twin disc precision  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:12:07):**  planter kind of planter but it's been converted to an air seeder so it's a precision planning  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:12:11):**  gear which is very standard in America and we can see that on Twitter we feel their feeds  
**[0:12:16-0:12:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:12:16):**  of what they're doing and the products they're using and then we can look at that and go  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:12:19):**  well maybe that'll work here and so you can actually get demonstrations of short videos  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:12:22):**  of what they're doing and why they're doing it so those are little tricks and trade that  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:12:26):**  works so the beauty of our machine is it is quite it's a bit like a bit like an old Falcon  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:12:31):**  you can work on it and do as much as you want you can get parts wherever you want it's got  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:12:34):**  a lot of flexibility to cater and tailor it for what you want it to do and yeah Twitter  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:12:39):**  is a great source for that when you don't have those sort of gear near you to compare  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:12:43):**  directly so it gives you those fresh ideas you don't know what you don't know.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:12:47):**  Of course do you want to ask about the decision to kind of build versus buy like you guys  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:12:51):**  have bought some stuff obviously that exists or that you've seen others using you've invested  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:12:55):**  in building your own solutions in some cases like what are maybe examples of built like  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:13:00):**  why build something and why buy something with with the technology you guys have built  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:13:04):**  and bought?  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:13:05):**  Yeah yeah yeah okay so probably the easy one with the buy is we like we bought a tow behind  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:13:11):**  spreader and we because we're early in adopters you sometimes get in and it's not quite to  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:13:16):**  the specs you want and you're often the one training the manufacturers that maybe you  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:13:20):**  should make this an option so when we bought our spreader it was on 2.25 meters just a  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:13:24):**  standard European width and we really needed it on three meters to be to be practical for  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:13:29):**  our system because they're on three meter control traffic and want to don't run a crop  
**[0:13:32-0:13:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:13:32):**  down so you know we we happen to be at a field days and we'd met some people at an axle company  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:13:39):**  and they seemed lovely seemed really knowledgeable and we're really surprised with how much they  
**[0:13:43-0:13:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:13:43):**  knew and so when we came to this problem we realized it was the same brand axle as what  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:13:46):**  these people we've met at the field days and so we we just messaged them and said is there  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:13:51):**  any chance you can get an axle for this and I said yeah no problem so here it is here's  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:13:55):**  all the load ratings so you know all fine and literally it's just bolted on and away  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:13:59):**  you go and those are the simple solutions where you just ordered something special for  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:14:04):**  you and now now they'll just release it as a three meter version because now they know  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:14:07):**  people want it and we same with our baler we have a high capacity high density chrome  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:14:11):**  baler and and the axles are steerable raked axles and and literally they said oh yeah  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:14:17):**  we've got the blueprints for that machine we can we can do that for you and the engineers  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:14:21):**  so just wait a little while the engineers are completed and they stand in a Meccano  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:14:24):**  set of parts just to bolt it on and away you go and they're the clever little things you  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:14:28):**  can do where you're not it's all rated you don't have to worry about engineering failures  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:14:34):**  or anything so you've got some sort of guarantee which is the risk when you start doing things  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:14:38):**  yourself but they're very simple and easy to do it's just a matter of looking and knowing  
**[0:14:42-0:14:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:14:42):**  who to talk to.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:14:43):**  What advice would you have for someone who like another farmer or that someone in the  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:14:49):**  space that's maybe less confident like it's what strikes me when you're talking is just  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:14:52):**  how confident you are and how fluent you are in this space for someone who wouldn't classify  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:14:56):**  themselves as an early adopter or who isn't as comfortable like what advice would you  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:15:00):**  have for them on a kind of build versus buy decision especially if they're not the ones  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:15:04):**  that think they're going to influence the manufacturer of the company and kind of new  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:15:07):**  features.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:15:08):**  Yeah I think the other thing too is yeah I think the thing is though that you need to  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:15:11):**  find a manufacturer that's willing to talk your language that understands where you're  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:15:16):**  at so some manufacturers are really keen to help you out and other guys will just be this  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:15:21):**  is the product this is the way it is and you might be really happy with that way it is  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:15:25):**  because it's super reliable and they're going to fully back it and there's no risk but other  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:15:29):**  times the company get really excited about actually feedback from the market so you got  
**[0:15:34-0:15:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:15:34):**  to remember these big companies they're trying to understand what they got to do too so if  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:15:37):**  you don't talk to them they don't know what to provide you that will make you happier  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:15:41):**  so it's a bit like you know getting the right presence for your wife if you don't ask you  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:15:45):**  you're going to get the wrong thing and you're getting in trouble actually probably in trouble  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:15:48):**  anyway but but you know what I mean so you want to be able to be able to communicate  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:15:53):**  to these manufacturers because they enjoy the feedback as much as trying to sell you  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:15:57):**  any they want you to have the right product and they learning from you as much as you're  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:16:00):**  learning from them so I think you just got to back yourself and and you've got to know  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:16:06):**  that that you have something that's valuable to them.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:16:09):**  I love that because one of the things we talk about more in the startup context but it strikes  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:16:13):**  me that it's just as applicable and I hadn't thought of that before is that kind of evaluate  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:16:18):**  your suppliers just as much as they're you know they're selling to you but you're evaluating  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:16:22):**  the product but you're also evaluating them like do they take your feedback on do they  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:16:25):**  listen do they want to improve the product that's just as important as how good is the  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:16:30):**  product right now.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:16:31):**  That's exactly right and very quickly you'll work out that this particular particular sales  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:16:38):**  people or assets that these companies have that are particularly good at certain jobs  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:16:42):**  and maybe not so good at others but you very quickly work out that I'll you know I should  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:16:46):**  definitely do it with this dealer because if I have any problems with this this guy's  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:16:49):**  a wizard he can fix anything where the year the other company and you like all this guy's  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:16:53):**  not he's too new he doesn't have any experience he doesn't understand anything I'm bumbling  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:16:57):**  through it myself better than he can and so very quickly you start getting it understanding  
**[0:17:02-0:17:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:17:02):**  where these guys are but at the same point with new technology having said that guys  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:17:05):**  are inexperienced you've got to give him a chance to learn as well and so when you are  
**[0:17:11-0:17:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:17:11):**  doing new things you've got to expect things not to work out as well as you'd hope so I  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:17:14):**  know one grower and he's working with some really innovative gear and and his attitude  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:17:19):**  that he's running with this stuff and he knows it's going to break it's a prototype but he's  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:17:23):**  still using it and when it breaks he changed back to the old gear and as soon as they've  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:17:28):**  repaired it or upgraded or improved it to make it work properly again he puts a straight  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:17:32):**  back on because he knows they need that data to make it to finish it off and get it finished  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:17:35):**  and make the product reliable and so yeah you've just got to make sure you just don't  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:17:39):**  sit there grizzling about how it's costing me money it's at that because the end result  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:17:43):**  is going to be greater and that's keeping that eye on the prize at the end and having  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:17:46):**  that vision.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:17:47):**  I love that because the attitude aspect of it but I guess there's some nuances there  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:17:52):**  that like expect it won't work but it sounds like in this case like also have a backup  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:17:56):**  plan like expect it won't work and be there for ready to to fill in what it doesn't so  
**[0:18:00-0:18:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:18:00):**  you're not kind of stuck without it.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:18:02):**  Yeah that's a funny one too Sarah because I think with with the disc seaters so there's  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:18:06):**  probably a 20% uptake of discs and and it's certain areas that are really benefiting from  
**[0:18:10-0:18:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:18:10):**  disc seaters in our in our region in the Wimmera and it's interesting that some growers will  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:18:18):**  have two machines or they'll ask for a machine that's interchangeable between tine and disc  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:18:22):**  because they're concerned that wet conditions might prevent this running whereas our approach  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:18:27):**  was pretty much like we're smart engineers we should be able to make this work and we'll  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:18:31):**  just work through it and improve our system and get to know our machine and make it work  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:18:35):**  so pretty much we were like cut the cut the apron strings we've got to come into this  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:18:41):**  machine to make it work versus having a backup plan which may then compromise the end solution  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:18:47):**  which is what we really want which was our disc machine to work really well so it can  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:18:51):**  lead to a lot of pain because you're still learning a lot but sometimes the cop out you  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:18:56):**  might go backwards so it's a real fine line because you don't want to lose money by not  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:19:00):**  getting things done on time but at the same point you've got to have that some incentive  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:19:04):**  to make sure you get the job done.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:19:06):**  Do you see that as different in the kind of mechanical space and working with big companies  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:19:10):**  versus the digital space like one thing about the digital space is how fast things can change  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:19:15):**  like push a new software release fix a bug etc. versus you know like something something  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:19:20):**  mechanical broke which you know may be easier to fix on farm depending on the skills that  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:19:24):**  you have but do you see any differences in that kind of jump in give it a go whether  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:19:28):**  it's a digital product?  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:19:29):**  Well I find that the problem with the digital products is you really don't have the ability  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:19:34):**  to fix it yourself you're not going to get a custom product for you you're going to get  
**[0:19:38-0:19:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:19:38):**  a custom product for your type of business so you don't quite have the same control and  
**[0:19:45-0:19:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:19:45):**  that can be frustrating because then it's like well I have to invest a lot of energy  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:19:48):**  to get these digital products to work and I don't want to be backing the loser and so  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:19:53):**  there's an awful lot of farmers I feel that are probably sitting back waiting to see which  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:19:57):**  are going to be the dominant players which are going to provide the best product and  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:20:00):**  and like you say it's such a fluid industry the product that was the best two years ago  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:20:05):**  is not necessarily the best anymore they haven't kept up the development at the same rate and  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:20:09):**  so yeah at the moment it's such a there's so many platforms out there it's just too  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:20:14):**  much information and I think there's probably going to be a bit of a cataclysm for these  
**[0:20:19-0:20:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:20:19):**  companies and they're going to have to whittle themselves down it's going to be quite a bit  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:20:21):**  of merging and and whittling down to the key players and maybe the key players still to  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:20:27):**  come I'm not sure they might not have even started producing a product yet but there's  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:20:30):**  definitely going to be a critical point where we're going to have to get a bit more clarity  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:20:34):**  because at the moment the products are I don't think they're as finished as they should be.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:20:40):**  Is there anything that would that does give you confidence like there are any digital  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:20:43):**  tools that despite this kind of winner take all dynamic and it's not clear who wins and  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:20:48):**  maybe things aren't fully flushed yet but that would give you confidence to give something  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:20:52):**  ago like are you don't have to say which products they are but are there things you're like  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:20:55):**  well that is worth it and we will go all in on that because you know it is in line with  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:00):**  where we're going.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:01):**  I think it's interesting yes I think it is interesting because we've had when there's  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:05):**  always an evolution obviously like with with guidance systems it was originally it was  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:08):**  a light bar and we used to follow a light bar and then we had some primitive guidance  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:12):**  we had to plug in your A and B every time you want to drive and and now they're already  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:17):**  preset all our fields already have their lines on and now it even turns on the end for you  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:21):**  because you've got enough computing power.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:22):**  I think it's the same with these digital programs initially the first versions coming  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:25):**  out we're doing interpretations of data which were only giving us as much insight as what  
**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:31):**  we could already tell.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:32):**  So it would be telling you that that's the wet area the paddock the bottom of the hill  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:37):**  and you're like well I could tell you that you don't have to spend any money with that  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:40):**  out.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:42):**  But what they're doing now is I think they're extending themselves a little bit further  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:44):**  they're building correlations to try and find insights that are you know second or third  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:49):**  degree insights ones you can't see directly and that's where the true power is going to  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:54):**  be.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:55):**  So I think the guys that are still flogging you know like a greenness map without actually  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:21:59):**  any value add to it and just assuming it's all nice and that's not adding quite as much  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:22:03):**  as telling me that this area is green because of this reason and this area is green because  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:22:07):**  of this reason and we should be doing something about it.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:22:10):**  And also the other thing too is a lot of these are very intensive so we're getting great  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:22:14):**  data in satellite imagery now but it's almost too much.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:22:18):**  So I don't want to get a map every day I want to know which maps are better every day to  
**[0:22:22-0:22:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:22:22):**  look at so give me the top five or give me the top three and I think they're working  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:22:26):**  that out as they're developing their tools and because there's so much competition the  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:22:30):**  ones that are doing that better are the ones that are getting ahead.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:22:32):**  So I think they're listening but it's also that fact like when you're dealing with a  
**[0:22:37-0:22:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:22:37):**  planter it's a custom piece of gear pretty much every farmer.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:22:40):**  Every farmer customizes their gear to a certain extent.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:22:43):**  A harvester a lot more standard but these digital tools are a bit more like a harvester  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:22:46):**  it's a very all-rounder sort of unit and at the moment we're still providing a lot of  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:22:50):**  feedback to these digital tools to make them work best for us in our environments and the  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:22:55):**  guys are still learning what we want and what we need versus what they think we might want.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:22:59):**  Yes definitely well good to hear that people are out there giving feedback and taking feedback  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:23:04):**  because there's still probably too much push and not enough kind of dialogue around that.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:23:08):**  Tell me about the build side so that was kind of all on the buy side when you guys have  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:23:12):**  decided to kind of fully take something in-house and build something.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:23:17):**  What's an example of that and kind of tell me the story of why you went down that path  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:23:21):**  and how it ended up.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:23:22):**  Yeah okay so probably the best one is our planter.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:23:25):**  So we've built our own plant.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:23:26):**  We've gone through an evolution so like I said earlier we had narrow points on our flexicoil  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:23:31):**  bar very common back in the in the 90s it served us really well but as people learn  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:23:37):**  more about how farming systems are working it wasn't good enough what we wanted to do.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:23:41):**  So then we went to a disk system and we had a daybreak disk which is a large oversized  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:23:46):**  disk which has minimum soil throw as opposed to a high soil throw.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:23:49):**  There's two different kind of distinct trains of thought there.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:23:53):**  Lots of soil throw for chemical incorporation in your pre-emergence or minimum soil throw  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:23:57):**  which we kind of feel is the right thing to do to prevent stimulation of the weeds in  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:24:01):**  the first place which takes load off the pre-ems you put out but then you have to use the correct  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:24:05):**  pre-ems which tend to be the more extensive ones but they also work really well because  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:24:09):**  there's less resistance to them.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:24:11):**  So we're running this disk system it was working quite well for about 10 years and then we  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:24:16):**  noticed that because of the control traffic our soil was becoming too friable and too  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:24:19):**  fluffy and the disks were actually some of the times they would stall and they wouldn't  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:24:24):**  rotate and so it wasn't doing a very good job in seed placement and also it still was  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:24:29):**  it was not a parallel link arm so that the seeding depth changed so there was a lot of  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:24:33):**  improvements we could do that we'd learnt from this disk.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:24:36):**  So then it came about there was an opportunity to buy a precision planter like a full-blown  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:24:39):**  precision planter and we were using that for a couple of years and we were amazed at the  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:24:44):**  job it did so the actual tool to get the seeds into the ground was brilliant.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:24:49):**  The only problem was that the singulation maybe they're still doing research on that  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:24:54):**  at BCG and at Adelaide Uni about what is actually going to be valuable to singulate.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:25:00):**  Things like canola are for sure but then things like wheat is their value in it so it can  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:25:04):**  do wheat but it couldn't do barley and it couldn't do oats.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:25:07):**  Now they're working on that and they're still improving it but once they start bringing  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:25:11):**  all of these commodities into the one machine we have an all-rounder that can do everything  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:25:14):**  rather than having two separate machines.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:25:17):**  We'd learnt from our time what was great for trash flow, we learnt from our disk that we  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:25:20):**  wanted to minimise soil disturbance and we wanted to be able to interrow and all this  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:25:24):**  sort of stuff and then with the twin disk we realised that this was the machine that  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:25:28):**  seemed to handle our soft soils and also give excellent placement.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:25:31):**  The only problem was that it was a singulator and that was no good in our system at the  
**[0:25:35-0:25:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:25:35):**  moment.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:25:36):**  So essentially we decided to build our own and we talked to some manufacturers and we  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:25:42):**  were really impressed with NDF up at Narrabri and Dale Foster builds bars up there and you  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:25:48):**  probably take out a power pole with them without too much problem, without scratching it.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:25:52):**  It's a great build, very reliable product and then what we did is we decided to add  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:25:57):**  on precision planting style row units.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:00):**  So we put row units on that matched what we'd seen with our precision planter and we wanted  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:04):**  to replicate that and Dale was kind enough to set up his bar and adjust the way we designed  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:09):**  it to suit what we wanted so again that's a classic example of providing feedback to  
**[0:26:13-0:26:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:13):**  a manufacturer.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:14):**  They take advantage of you and use you for R&D to design the new product but that works  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:18):**  for us because that's what we wanted and so it was a benefit for both parties you know.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:24):**  And he learned a lot too, some people just love challenges and it was great what he'd  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:28):**  done there.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:29):**  And then on top of that we have all this precision planting gear that we put on top.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:33):**  So we have individual row pressure control so each row has hydraulic downforce which  
**[0:26:39-0:26:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:39):**  can also lift.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:41):**  So if you're going through swale country and you had hard pans and soft sand hills it would  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:46):**  actually put up to 200 kilos or more onto it in the hard pan to get penetration and  
**[0:26:52-0:26:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:52):**  then on the sand hills it could lift it out of the ground to make sure it didn't sow the  
**[0:26:55-0:26:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:55):**  seeds too deep.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:56):**  So you've got very good even placement.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:26:58):**  And then we have things like Keaton seed terms, these are all the little things that you learn  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:27:02):**  as you play with your tools and you go on the journey.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:27:05):**  And probably the coolest little thing we've added on last is we converted to an air seeder  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:27:10):**  so that was nice but it's retrofit-able to be a planter one day.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:27:14):**  So we haven't lost money there so we're hoping this bar will last us a long time.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:27:18):**  And yeah we also went and put tracks on it because we believe in keeping our stubble  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:27:22):**  standing and it matched in with our tractor and helps.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:27:27):**  Keeping the standing stubble is to help our lentils trellis and just saves us a bit.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:27:30):**  So it's a mode of thought and sticks to our control traffic lines.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:27:33):**  And then we put smart firmers on.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:27:35):**  So we've got some smart firmers on and these devices have an optical sensor that actually  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:27:40):**  tells you the quality of the job you're doing on the go.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:27:42):**  So it measures organic carbon, it measures the uniformity of the furrow, it tells you  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:27:47):**  whether you put organic matter into the slot which is a problem if you put herbicides out  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:27:50):**  because it'll wick the herbicide into around the seed and sterilise it.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:27:55):**  It tells you the soil temperature, it can tell you the cation exchange capacity and  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:01):**  there's another thing it does too that's amazing.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:03):**  Something else that's really important that I can't recall now but it's got all this  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:07):**  great data coming out of it.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:10):**  There is a connectivity issue with it but we collected like 16 gigs of data off our  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:15):**  seed last year and probably get more this year because of a few upgrades on it.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:19):**  But yeah it's just fascinating data and you're like once I start collecting this stuff I  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:23):**  can start layering that up and I can use some of these new digital tools to analyse it for  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:28):**  me and try and find some relationships that I can't see and then make some smart decisions  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:32):**  about how I'm spending my money.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:34):**  That's super impressive and sounds almost science fiction-y and you're like and we  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:37):**  also have this and we also have this.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:39):**  I have a couple questions.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:41):**  Over how long did that happen?  
**[0:28:43-0:28:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:43):**  You mentioned a couple iterations and we learned this and we saw this.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:46):**  How long did it take from kind of alright we're going to build something ourselves to  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:49):**  where you are now?  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:50):**  I think that once we'd had all the tools and we knew we kind of were heading forward it  
**[0:28:54-0:29:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:28:54):**  was probably about a year that was spent choosing what we were going to put on it and getting  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:29:01):**  it built and it had to be designed the frame to actually take how we wanted to and so there's  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:29:06):**  a bit of visitation going on to make sure that things worked out properly.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:29:10):**  But again it was kind of a as you work with a tool you understand the deficiencies in  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:29:16):**  it and these are the things you're putting in your checklist of things in your head so  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:29:19):**  that whenever you get the opportunity to go you just download all those things and you  
**[0:29:24-0:29:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:29:24):**  say right are any of these practical to put in are we going to solve all these problems  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:29:27):**  with a new machine.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:29:28):**  So we did as many things we could to fix all the problems we'd seen in the past and improve  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:29:32):**  on what was there but the key thing is you're providing yourself with a platform to spring  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:29:38):**  off to next.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:29:40):**  So all the tools even the digital tools you want something that you can start with something  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:29:45):**  basic but it is not going to limit you to just that function in the future when something  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:29:48):**  new comes that you don't know about no problems I can just bolt it on or I can upload this  
**[0:29:53-0:29:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:29:53):**  or it'll enable me to download this now or whatever.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:29:56):**  So it's about having a you don't treat a bar as a finished product nothing is a finished  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:01):**  product it's always about what can I learn from this to go to the next step so when I  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:04):**  have to make my next purchase or when I'm going to make my next purchase I know what  
**[0:30:08-0:30:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:08):**  to do.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:09):**  Yeah what are your neighbors and other people think like are you guys crazy for doing this  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:13):**  do they wish they had one do they want to buy one from you like what's the reaction  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:17):**  been?  
**[0:30:18-0:30:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:18):**  I think it's shiny and new and expensive so there's obviously not everyone can copy what  
**[0:30:25-0:30:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:25):**  we're doing but I think it's I think they appreciate the fact that we're doing certain  
**[0:30:28-0:30:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:28):**  things and proving what can and can't work.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:30):**  Now you don't have to do everything obviously but it's amazing the uptake of this seat is  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:35):**  even close to us a lot of farmers who never would have thought of it you hear them talking  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:39):**  about it and then sooner or later it's in their field so clearly they can see the benefits  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:43):**  of certain aspects of the business and again it's about how it fits in their model as well  
**[0:30:47-0:30:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:47):**  they've got to get their heads around oh I really like one of those but it's not so much  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:50):**  about I want one of those it's like I need one of these to fix this problem I'm seeing  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:54):**  now and so south of Horsham the dissed seed is very popular at the moment because they  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:30:59):**  allow people to sow the crops dry and it can get quite wet down south and so you're getting  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:31:04):**  your crops in when you can versus trying to get it in when it's all muddy and you're gonna  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:31:08):**  do a bad job so huge benefit identified that and they can see that they had a problem they  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:31:12):**  couldn't get the crop in time why don't I do it before it gets too wet this leader can  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:31:16):**  do that to me so then there's an interest you know like one thing I wanted to ask about  
**[0:31:20-0:31:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:31:20):**  is the I guess the traditional kind of research and development system has been you know the  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:31:24):**  RDCs and others investing in research or universities and multinationals that might spin out into  
**[0:31:29-0:31:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:31:29):**  a product that a multinational commercializes and come to you through an existing dealer  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:31:33):**  and then there's the kind of startup you know digital tech coming to you from you know venture  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:31:38):**  backed startups and all that and then there's producers you know building their own solutions  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:31:42):**  with contractors like do you see those worlds all existing together in the future are they  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:31:47):**  colliding do you like are they all useful tools just in different ways I think I think  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:31:53):**  they all need to exist I mean it's the it's the entrepreneurs and innovators that are  
**[0:31:57-0:32:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:31:57):**  helping the big companies get ahead they're the ones that are the sticking their necks  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:32:00):**  out for a chance on a product which could be absolutely brilliant but the big companies  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:32:05):**  are not going to fork out the research dollars for something as speculative as that so they  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:32:09):**  need those companies and the farmers obviously designing products that are specifically suited  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:32:14):**  to their needs as opposed to I can sell this many units if I make it applicable to Europe  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:32:18):**  Australia and and America but you just want a product that's suitable for your farm not  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:32:23):**  for some guy in France so yeah you need to you need those local farmers that are sort  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:32:27):**  of solving things for you and especially when they're things that are not going to necessarily  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:32:32):**  add big value overseas so a digital platform is going to work really well overseas but  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:32:37):**  at the same point there's parts of digital platforms that modules and stuff that we might  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:32:42):**  need that other people don't and so it's made about communicating those things so there  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:32:46):**  is some even digital innovation locally but a lot of the local innovation will be mechanical  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:32:51):**  and the research organizations I think it's really important that that they provide most  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:32:55):**  of them are there to provide for the bulk of farmers but they also need to be dedicating  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:32:59):**  a certain amount to what you call R&D the next step where could we be going what's next  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:33:04):**  what's an option that might work for us in the future because you can't just sit static  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:33:09):**  nature is too smart for us to develop a model and agree that that's the best rotation or  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:33:14):**  that this is the best system you've got to keep adapting it to keep ahead and keep mixing  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:33:19):**  it up because it's never a static playing field and what's good is it's inspiring you  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:33:24):**  know like you want to you want to encourage other people to do similar stuff to what we're  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:33:29):**  doing so that we can keep pushing the envelope forward if it's just one guy it's really hard  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:33:33):**  but if you've got a lot of people asking for the same things or getting that same inspiration  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:33:37):**  or coming up with a different idea we need to keep doing that so it's really exciting  
**[0:33:41-0:33:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:33:41):**  when you when you get people out and they enjoy and learn something from what you do  
**[0:33:45-0:33:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=365393#t=0:33:45):**  it's really good.

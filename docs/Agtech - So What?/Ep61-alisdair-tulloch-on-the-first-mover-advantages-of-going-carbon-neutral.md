### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 04 Mar 2020 19:25:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:00:12):**  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:00:17):**  started. But there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:00:22):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:00:27):**  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  
**[0:00:31-0:00:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:00:31):**  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolette. Today's guest is Alastair Tulloch of Keith  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:00:42):**  Tulloch Wines. Alastair has a business degree from the University of Newcastle and is currently  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:00:48):**  studying applied science, both wine and viticulture at Charles Sturt University. Alastair came  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:00:54):**  recommended to us by a previous podcast guest, Karen Stark, for the work he's doing in sustainability  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:01:00):**  and carbon sequestration. Thanks, Karen. This whole area is such a hot topic right now with  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:01:06):**  a lot of big claims out there. So it was really exciting to talk to a grower who's actually  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:01:12):**  on the journey to carbon neutral. In this episode, Alastair shares what made him go  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:01:16):**  down the path to carbon neutral, what practices and technologies they're using and what is  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:01:21):**  and isn't working, and the financials. What are the expensive parts and where are the  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:01:26):**  returns coming from? Alastair starts with an overview of the family business. I work  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:01:31):**  at Keith Tulloch Wine, which is my father's business. I've worked there pretty much my  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:01:36):**  entire life. He's a fourth generation grape grower in Hunter Valley wine country. So we  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:01:40):**  have an estate in Peculban. We farm there about 50 tonnes of grapes and then we have  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:01:44):**  a production winery on site as well, using the grapes from the vineyard there as well  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:01:49):**  as a couple of other vineyards, some which we own, some which we manage and others which  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:01:54):**  we just buy the fruit. So yeah, it's pretty full time for a small family business. It's  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:01:58):**  a pretty big operation, but there's always something to do. Keith Tulloch is certified  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:02:02):**  as a carbon neutral winery, the first actually in the Hunter Valley. But how did Alastair  
**[0:02:07-0:02:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:02:07):**  working there see this opportunity and realize that the business needed to change? The reason  
**[0:02:13-0:02:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:02:13):**  that sustainability is really key to the way I view agribusiness is because viticulture  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:02:20):**  and grape growing is such a sensitive style of farming, such a sensitive crop. And we've  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:02:25):**  been able to track and watch the changes in the climate and the warming effect in terms  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:02:30):**  of the growing season on our vineyards and even my grandfather's vineyards going back  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:02:35):**  with some of the records I have right back to the 1950s and 1960s. And we've been seeing  
**[0:02:41-0:02:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:02:41):**  since the mid 1980s this really gradual moving forward of the date of harvest, which is actually  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:02:48):**  linked further ahead in the growing season when the vines come out of dormancy and their  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:02:52):**  bud burst. It's moving further forward each year because our winters are just disappearing  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:02:58):**  slowly but surely. And that rate of warming has really started to increase and the shift  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:03:03):**  forward of our harvest dates has really increased in the last decade. And more and more I wanted  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:03:09):**  to do something about it rather than just watching it.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:03:12):**  You would have seen years and years of that data. Was there a moment you said, right,  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:03:15):**  like we're going to actually do something about it?  
**[0:03:17-0:03:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:03:17):**  Yeah, it was really through the 2017-2018 growing seasons when we just had temperatures  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:03:24):**  that were unbelievable, sort of 47-48 degrees Celsius. And after those years, it wasn't  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:03:30):**  just the single days but like prolonged heat waves. We had to invest in a huge amount of  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:03:34):**  money in rolling out irrigation across vineyards, which were 50 years old, had never needed  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:03:39):**  irrigation before. But just due to these heat waves that we were seeing and the change in  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:03:45):**  these maximums and the frequency of the heat waves, we started to route this irrigation  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:03:50):**  and I'm there going like this. We're looking at the warming which we've seen now and how's  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:03:55):**  this picture going to look 20-30 years down the track. So there was this moment where  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:04:00):**  in the wine industry we've seen this problem for a long time. There was this moment where  
**[0:04:03-0:04:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:04:03):**  it just kind of was really clear to me that this warming trend and the issue we have with  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:04:10):**  the change in climate and viticulture, it's got a really bad endpoint. And I started speaking  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:04:15):**  publicly more about the effects of climate change in viticulture and in grape growing  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:04:20):**  and then the effects in winemaking. And I wanted to make sure that we were doing everything  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:04:24):**  on farm that we could so that I wasn't just complaining about it but I was actually doing  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:04:28):**  something.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:04:29):**  What was the conversation like with your family? Were they like-minded to do something as well?  
**[0:04:33-0:04:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:04:33):**  Yeah, well I'm lucky that in terms of the way that I see chatting about climate change,  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:04:40):**  there isn't really a generational divide in most grape growers I've talked to, just given  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:04:46):**  how clear the issue is. So when I talked to my parents, they were really positive about  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:04:51):**  the idea of doing things. The thing was getting past then the idea that our small change wasn't  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:04:57):**  going to make a difference because they're being realistic and saying, you know, reducing  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:05:01):**  our carbon footprint or eliminating our carbon footprint is not going to change the heat  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:05:06):**  wave, it's not going to change this. But I really wanted to be part of solutions. And  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:05:11):**  the other thing is that when I go into the supermarket in my personal life, I try and  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:05:16):**  find sustainable products, I try and look for sustainable products. I know a lot of  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:05:20):**  people that do the same. And if there aren't the options on the shelf, people kind of pick  
**[0:05:24-0:05:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:05:24):**  the best worst option. So for me, being that sustainable option wasn't just a good thing  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:05:32):**  that people could produce their carbon emissions by buying a carbon neutral product. But I  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:05:37):**  know how much people are looking for products like that as well. So it made good marketing  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:05:41):**  sense as well.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:05:43):**  This idea of being carbon neutral was the start of a journey for Alastair, a journey  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:05:47):**  that would lead to some big changes in the vineyard and at the winery. Some were changes  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:05:51):**  that consumers would see, some were experiments that have yet to work out, and others just  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:05:56):**  made good business sense. But when Alastair started out, he really didn't know where he'd  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:06:01):**  end up.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:06:02):**  We started on the carbon neutrality, because, first of all, I was just interested to figure  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:06:06):**  out and assess what our footprint was, and then see about how I could go reducing it.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:06:12):**  It wasn't looking to be carbon neutral, it was just kind of, you know, it was just kind  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:06:16):**  of seemed like something really interesting to do. I mean, at the time, we were pretty  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:06:19):**  happy with the way the farm was running, we were happy with the grape quality, we were  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:06:23):**  happy with the yields. So we weren't really looking too hard at things like the soil carbon  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:06:30):**  and things we'll get on to later. But it just became something really obvious when I was  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:06:35):**  looking for ways to link the business's carbon neutrality to soil health. And there are some  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:06:41):**  parts of the vineyard inputs like synthetic fertilizers, and their release of nitrous  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:06:46):**  oxide, which is not carbon footprint, but greenhouse gas footprint. And we include those  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:06:52):**  emissions, convert them to CO2 equivalents. And that's a part of our carbon footprint  
**[0:06:57-0:06:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:06:57):**  for our business.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:06:58):**  So what did it feel like to take the first step and go down the path toward being carbon  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:07:03):**  neutral?  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:07:04):**  I was kind of scared at first, because when you pick the grapes, and then you ferment  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:07:09):**  them, the fermentation releases huge amounts of CO2. I think the amount is about six liters  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:07:15):**  of CO2 for one litre of wine. So proportionately, I was like, our footprint is going to be massive.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:07:20):**  It actually didn't turn out that way. And it seems really obvious when you point it  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:07:25):**  out that every single molecule of carbon, every single atom of carbon is released from  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:07:30):**  the fermentation is actually sequestered by the plants in that growing season. Given its  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:07:35):**  perennial horticulture, most of the carbon is stored in the woody parts of the trunk,  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:07:40):**  in the canes and the leaves, in the fruit that gets left behind after we've finished  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:07:44):**  pressing it and even the alcohol that's in the wine.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:07:48):**  So the carbon footprint wasn't as massive as I thought it was. And it was mostly linked  
**[0:07:53-0:07:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:07:53):**  to things like electricity use, some of the fertilizers in the vineyards, and then, annoyingly  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:07:59):**  enough, transport and glassware, which is something which has been really hard to reduce  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:08:04):**  beyond what we've done the last couple of years.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:08:06):**  Did you get in a consultant to do that and kind of do that, what I think is called a  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:08:11):**  life cycle assessment and how long did it take? And you don't have to say in exact figures,  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:08:16):**  but I imagine growers listening are going to wonder roughly what did that cost if you're  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:08:20):**  willing to share?  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:08:22):**  Yeah. So we did have experts come in to help us because just going through your business  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:08:28):**  and looking at every single item and calculating its greenhouse gas emissions is tricky the  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:08:34):**  first time without help. Finding accurate information and even knowing some things to  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:08:40):**  look for like going around and accounting all of your greenhouse gases from refrigerant  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:08:45):**  gases, for example, or from the amount of waste that's going to landfill. These things  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:08:49):**  that don't really strike you as really obvious the first time around you do them, but once  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:08:54):**  you've got the frame of mind, they start to be easier.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:08:57):**  And so, yeah, we used a consultant who basically showed us the carbon accounting and like you  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:09:03):**  said, the life cycle assessment. So we have two different types of carbon neutrality for  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:09:08):**  our business actually. One is the products, which is like a bottle of wine and that has  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:09:13):**  its life cycle assessment from the moment that the first grapes are picked includes  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:09:17):**  the glassware and the caps and the labels and all of the inputs we put into it and includes  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:09:23):**  getting it to the customer. And then in terms of the organisational carbon neutrality, that's  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:09:28):**  our other sort of form of carbon neutrality that includes just your day to day operational  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:09:33):**  overheads and things like getting to and from work in the cars, the sort of emissions we'll  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:09:38):**  use to go and fly and market the wines and then things like running the tractors on site  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:09:43):**  and using those fertilisers and things like that. So they are two different things to  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:09:48):**  get through and some of them, as I was saying before, they're not the most intuitive, but  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:09:54):**  getting the accounting side done is actually not expensive. You can get an accountant to  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:10:00):**  do this life cycle assessment with you for just a couple of grand. It's not really a  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:10:05):**  huge expense. And even offsetting any emissions that you can't avoid or that you can't sequester  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:10:11):**  on farm isn't that expensive. What is expensive is going through the more rigorous auditing  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:10:17):**  and certification that goes to the level we've achieved where we're certified by the Australian  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:10:21):**  government because they're just trying to make sure that that is a bulletproof level  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:10:26):**  of certification. So once you get to that level, there's a lot more financial involvement.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:10:32):**  And are there tiers of it? So like you, is it, is it a tier of claims where you can,  
**[0:10:38-0:10:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:10:38):**  you get your assessment, you know how much carbon you're emitting and then you can buy  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:10:41):**  offsets and then you can say something, but to get, are there kind of an accreditation  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:10:46):**  one, two, three, and it tiers up in price or how does that work?  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:10:49):**  It's really just the different styles. Like I was saying, there's the product and the  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:10:54):**  organization and some people might run an event and decided that event will be carbon  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:10:59):**  neutral or they might have a big range of products and decide, you know, we'll have  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:11:04):**  this one carbon neutral product over here that we can sell to customers that are more  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:11:08):**  environmentally friendly, but we don't have to do anything with our other products.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:11:12):**  It's so interesting. Like you have this, you have this scheme that's, um, good, like as  
**[0:11:17-0:11:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:11:17):**  we'll get into, I think good for the vineyard and good for the business and good for the  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:11:20):**  consumers, but the people, there's like this middleman making money, making the certificate  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:11:24):**  expensive. But I find it so fascinating that the actual expensive part is the paying for  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:11:29):**  the thing you've already done to get to get the marketing value of thing you've already  
**[0:11:32-0:11:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:11:32):**  done, not doing the thing, which doesn't seem that great.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:11:35):**  Yeah, it's frustrating. Definitely frustrating. Did you know that going in when you, when  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:11:40):**  you kind of did all the work and then you really got to the end and we're like, Oh,  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:11:42):**  we have, we have, now we have to pay for this thing. Or how did that happen?  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:11:46):**  The thing that the financial thing, I guess is an interesting conversation and just talking  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:11:49):**  about like the carbon neutrality and that license fee itself doesn't tell the full story.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:11:55):**  And it's just because we knew about the phase for the licensing when we started and we knew  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:12:00):**  about the audits that was all kind of laid out to us, even including all of those licensing  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:12:05):**  phase and all of the investments we've made in emissions reduction, we're actually saving  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:12:10):**  so much money through this emissions reduction. And as mostly because if you are doing the  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:12:15):**  carbon accounting and you're looking not only at where your emissions come from, but  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:12:19):**  then seriously trying to reduce them, you can actually just find all these parts of  
**[0:12:23-0:12:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:12:23):**  your operation, which is so wasteful and eliminate that waste. So, and that vineyard and in the  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:12:30):**  winery and in the entire operation of the business. So yeah, we'll continue on with  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:12:35):**  the story. So you went down this process, got the life cycle assessment, did the offsets,  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:12:39):**  got the licensing to be able to approve it. And then did you start saying right here were  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:12:42):**  areas where we could actually tick boxes to do efficiencies or what happened next?  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:12:47):**  Yeah. So when it comes to like the actual certification of being carbon neutral, it  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:12:53):**  isn't enough just to say that you'll have this carbon footprint and just offset it every  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:12:59):**  single year. That's not really the goal of the certification. I don't think it's really  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:13:04):**  that helpful in that aspect. It actually involves a plan for emissions reduction consistently  
**[0:13:11-0:13:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:13:11):**  across a number of years. And so in the first year, we took out about 20% of our carbon  
**[0:13:18-0:13:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:13:18):**  emissions through installation of the solar PV and the other donation of synthetic fertilizers  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:13:25):**  was about another 10 or 15%. We changed over to a lighter weight glassware, which saved  
**[0:13:31-0:13:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:13:31):**  I think about 25 tonnes of CO2. So looking at like about three or 4% of the operational  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:13:39):**  CO2 footprint. And so like there was a number of things that we could just change straight  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:13:44):**  away and that was before we were even carbon neutral certified.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:13:48):**  And on the fertilizers, what did you do instead? Yeah. So changing over the fertilizers was  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:13:55):**  actually a really good farming practice and reduced our CO2 footprint massively. Basically  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:14:01):**  what we do is we're sowing cover crops into the mid rows. So that's between where the  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:14:07):**  grape vines grow. And more recently we've actually started seeding in cover crops that  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:14:12):**  underneath and around the vines themselves in what we call the under vine area. And that's  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:14:18):**  having really good effects, not just to reduce the amount of fertilizer that we're using.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:14:23):**  It also reduces cost. It eliminates the use of herbicide and to do with some of the effects  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:14:29):**  we were talking about with heat waves as the climate's warmed, we've actually seen that  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:14:33):**  by keeping this soil underneath the vines covered and greened, better retention of soil  
**[0:14:38-0:14:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:14:38):**  moisture and cooler temperatures in the vine canopy and on the ground during these heat  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:14:45):**  waves. So the management technique of going to cover crops, which keep the soil covered  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:14:51):**  and fix nitrogen and fix carbon into both the mid rows and the under vine has been like  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:14:57):**  a really big transformation in the style of agriculture that we're doing on farm.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:15:02):**  Was it scary to do that? Cause it is pretty different than, you know, going through and  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:15:06):**  spraying and get rid of, were you like nervous the first year that like, how's this going  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:15:09):**  to go? What's going to be impact on yield?  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:15:12):**  Yeah, no, I mean not just nervous first year, but nervous second and third, because my grandfather's  
**[0:15:17-0:15:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:15:17):**  always walking around and he's very old school. He doesn't like weeds. The thing about making  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:15:25):**  these changes is that you have to look at the holistic picture. It's not just enough  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:15:29):**  to say, well, your yields may decline slightly because you're also really reducing your inputs.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:15:35):**  So looking at your, the amount of dollars you're spending per hectare of farming and  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:15:40):**  you yield per hectare, it needs to be kind of relevant and it's, you need to fix those  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:15:45):**  two things to one another. Also, we're all going through what has been a pretty incredible  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:15:50):**  drought, so you have to take a grain of salt with that as well. But that said, we have  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:15:55):**  two blocks running, one with the sort of more holistic style, the more regenerative soil  
**[0:16:02-0:16:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:16:02):**  and one with not using chemical fertilisers, but using compost and chicken manure. And  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:16:08):**  where we're using these cover crops, even though there's slightly more competition,  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:16:12):**  we didn't see a change in the yields between those two vineyards. And actually in this  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:16:17):**  last season just gone, anecdotally speaking to other growers around the area, our yields  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:16:21):**  were very healthy, even though they were 50% down on what we'd normally expect. There was  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:16:26):**  people losing 60, 70, 80% of their crop and they had irrigation and they're running a  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:16:31):**  traditional agriculture.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:16:34):**  That's such an interesting insight that you, so tell me if I'm right on, but you've moved  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:16:39):**  wholly off of the old practice, but you actually did some R&D within that to see which kind  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:16:44):**  of fork in the road was actually the best one to go down, that kind of approach of,  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:16:48):**  you know, make the switch, but do it with some backup plans or kind of options for how  
**[0:16:52-0:16:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:16:52):**  it could actually play out.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:16:54):**  Yeah, well, I mean, I guess going back to my grandfather before, he's a research scientist,  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:17:00):**  a viticultural research scientist before he started planting vineyards. And so for him,  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:17:05):**  controls in studies are really important. So all of these things that we've done have  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:17:10):**  been implemented and rolled out over a number of years. Also, you know, me not being the  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:17:16):**  vineyard manager, me having these ideas and wanting to implement them and linking them  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:17:21):**  into things like our carbon neutrality. As a lot of people out there will know, things  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:17:25):**  can be really difficult to change. You change everything at once and things can really go  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:17:29):**  pear shaped. I understand that, but going through these incremental changes and talking  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:17:34):**  with family members who have been farming for, you know, 50, 60 years, there's definitely  
**[0:17:40-0:17:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:17:40):**  some to and fro as ideas get passed around. And I'm really happy to say that some of these  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:17:47):**  ideas have really worked and changed their mind in how we farm.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:17:51):**  Is there anything you've tried that totally didn't work?  
**[0:17:54-0:18:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:17:54):**  Yeah, so the Undivine cover cropping, it worked really well in sandier soils because we used  
**[0:18:01-0:18:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:18:01):**  a clover, a white clover, and that was fantastic. It made this nice big blanket of web that  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:18:08):**  suppressed other weeds. You know, you can pull up underneath the vine, it's still moist,  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:18:13):**  the soil, you can see the nitrogen that's being fixed on the roots of the clover, but  
**[0:18:18-0:18:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:18:18):**  up in the clay soils on the red wine soils, oh my God, it failed so miserably. Yeah, like  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:18:25):**  there was no coverage. The weeds came in and took over. There was wireweed and cooch everywhere.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:18:31):**  And my old man was looking at it going like that did not work. And so, you know, there's  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:18:37):**  definitely more work to be done that we managed to establish the clover and it's doing an  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:18:42):**  amazing job with about 50% of our vineyards. And, you know, I'm looking to increase that  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:18:48):**  and sow out more clover over the next growing season.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:18:52):**  I asked Alastair about the possibility of using livestock like sheep to manage weeds  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:18:57):**  in the vineyard. Unfortunately, their property isn't set up well for this, but it is something  
**[0:19:02-0:19:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:19:02):**  that he's looked at.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:19:04):**  Yeah, that is a great management technique, but unfortunately our property is actually  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:19:09):**  only a section of what used to be a larger vineyard that was split into smaller lots.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:19:14):**  And so our borderlines are not fences. They're just unfortunately where one vineyard ends  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:19:20):**  and another starts. So a lot of rows would have to come out to introduce grazing into  
**[0:19:26-0:19:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:19:26):**  that agricultural system. I actually went to a agricultural workshop just regarding  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:19:34):**  this weed control and the agricultural scientist who ran it ran about 12 different studies  
**[0:19:40-0:19:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:19:40):**  using herbicide, like organic alternate herbicide, like slasher, undervine, flaming, steaming,  
**[0:19:47-0:19:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:19:47):**  cultivating, mowing, like undervine slashing. And at the end of it, he said, actually I'm  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:19:54):**  kind of embarrassed because the vineyard that we were working on, their control beat every  
**[0:19:59-0:20:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:19:59):**  single method we tried. And their control was adjusting sheep in the vineyard between  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:20:07):**  harvest and bud burst. And when they went and looked at the dollars per hectare that  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:20:11):**  it costs, it was like all of these inputs had operator costs and costs of the machinery  
**[0:20:16-0:20:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:20:16):**  and stuff, all the chemicals and the grazing was like earning money because they're getting  
**[0:20:24-0:20:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:20:24):**  the sheep into just things. Yeah, for the people that can work livestock into a agricultural  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:20:31):**  system is something that I would love to do, but it's just not practical with our side  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:20:35):**  unfortunately.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:20:36):**  Yeah. Someday when we have virtual fencing, then you can add the sheep in and you won't  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:20:40):**  need actual fences.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:20:41):**  Yeah. Yeah. Look forward to it.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:20:45):**  After picking off some of the low hanging fruit for emissions reductions, Alistair started  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:20:50):**  looking at ways to improve biodiversity.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:20:53):**  I got into the idea of planting, trying to reestablish native trees in some areas of  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:20:58):**  our vineyard, which weren't that practical for viticulture, like around the riparian  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:21:03):**  areas we have like creek lines going through some of the blocks. And so that opens up that  
**[0:21:08-0:21:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:21:08):**  corridor to potentially planting, trying to reestablish some of the native plants, which  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:21:16):**  have been displaced obviously somewhat by the viticulture that comes in and creates  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:21:21):**  to a degree a monoculture across the vineyard side.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:21:25):**  So what I did was I went and started planting trees, native trees that also promoted beneficial  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:21:32):**  insects to the vineyard system. And I planted about 200 by the time that a research scientist  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:21:38):**  from the New South Wales department of primary industries gave me a call. His name is Darren  
**[0:21:43-0:21:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:21:43):**  Faye and he said, this is great. And we want to turn this into a bigger trial, a trial  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:21:50):**  that they can track. And so with him, we established about another 300 trees and I've done another  
**[0:21:56-0:22:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:21:56):**  planting about 100 trees myself. So about 600 trees in total on the property that are  
**[0:22:03-0:22:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:22:03):**  specifically aimed at increasing the populations of beneficial insects. And so when we obviously  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:22:10):**  use pesticides for controlling pests in the vineyard, that also knocks back all of your  
**[0:22:16-0:22:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:22:16):**  beneficials as well, apart from setting aside pesticide use potential impacts of that, purely  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:22:24):**  looking at the vineyard landscape, the not losing all of your beneficials really just  
**[0:22:29-0:22:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:22:29):**  leaves a vacuum later for pests to come back into. So what we've looked at is can we increase  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:22:36):**  the populations of these assassin bugs, parasitic wasps, lady beetles, the kind of things that  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:22:42):**  are going to eat hoppers, they're going to eat light brown apple moth or vine moth, the  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:22:46):**  kind of things that can really cause serious damage to crops. Can we boost their numbers  
**[0:22:52-0:22:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:22:52):**  to the right kind of level to control these pests and then eliminate pesticide use from  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:22:59):**  our vineyards. So that's an ongoing study. But apart from the fact that we get to plant  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:23:04):**  trees and reestablish the flora biodiversity of the vineyard, I think that the fauna and  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:23:10):**  that beneficial insect populations are really exciting thing to be looking into.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:23:14):**  So what's next for Keith Tulloch on this journey towards carbon neutral? Alastair has been  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:23:18):**  looking at other areas of the supply chain, like processing and waste.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:23:23):**  Most of the other things that we've really been doing are more going to the production  
**[0:23:27-0:23:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:23:27):**  end of the wild business. So looking at investment in new refrigeration, it's been a massive  
**[0:23:34-0:23:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:23:34):**  save of emissions for us, optimizing our use of refrigerant, changing our, I guess something  
**[0:23:41-0:23:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:23:41):**  that's a bit relevant is just based from the business. What we're doing there is introducing  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:23:48):**  birds so that we can reduce the amount of organic material that's going to landfill.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:23:53):**  What's especially amazing to me is that they've made all of these changes and reduced their  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:23:57):**  carbon footprint by over 30% in just the last two or three years. But now that the big changes  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:24:03):**  have been made, each incremental improvement will be harder to achieve.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:24:07):**  It doesn't happen in the blink of an eye, but to slowly work through some of the more  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:24:14):**  minute problems now that we've got to the point where we've reduced these large emissions  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:24:19):**  and then try and search now within our business for suppliers, which are also on a similar  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:24:25):**  vein, we can start rolling over those contracts and replacing suppliers with those that are  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:24:30):**  carbon neutral or lower emissions and see where we go from there.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:24:33):**  And how do you think about the return on this? If you like, if there's any skeptics out there  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:24:38):**  who still think that kind of sustainability stuff is all about either feel good or you  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:24:42):**  have to have heaps of money to do it, how do you think about the return on investment  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:24:46):**  from a financial perspective?  
**[0:24:49-0:24:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:24:49):**  So for me, the actual process of becoming carbon neutral has been something that's really  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:24:56):**  good from both points of view. There's the financial point of view because we've seen  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:25:01):**  all of these efficiencies that we can find in our business, all this wastage that we've  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:25:06):**  cut out. And we're still looking at the yields of the vineyards and being really happy with  
**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:25:12):**  what we have in the picture of what people around us have seen.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:25:16):**  So the actual bare bones finances of becoming carbon neutral has been really positive from  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:25:25):**  our business, from a profitability point of view. The other thing that people have to  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:25:30):**  keep in mind if they're selling discretionary products like wine, like I sell, is that customers  
**[0:25:35-0:25:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:25:35):**  really care about this. And so the enthusiasm that's been from our direct sales and the  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:25:42):**  sales in our direct sales has been really, really good. Also, we've started to see really  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:25:47):**  big sales come in from businesses who are searching for product lines, they're searching  
**[0:25:53-0:26:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:25:53):**  for business to business purchases that reduce their carbon footprint. And I think you'll  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:26:01):**  see that as becoming more and more a feature of the corporate social responsibility that  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:26:06):**  may seem a million miles away from on-farm activities that can really influence the demand  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:26:12):**  for these sustainable products. When you have big businesses that set themselves lower emissions  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:26:18):**  targets, they then have to go around and try and find these products. And if you can offer  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:26:24):**  them the product, then you're basically walking into a sure thing as a supplier. I think it's  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:26:30):**  important to differentiate that from the bare bones finances of being carbon neutral because  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:26:35):**  there's early adopter advantages in doing this right now, which will obviously diminish  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:26:40):**  the more people that are doing it. And I want to see more people do it. And if everybody  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:26:43):**  thinks that they've lost the first mover advantage, then they'll kind of go, nah, don't worry  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:26:47):**  about it. They've got that sale now, that's their thing. It's not like that. It's much  
**[0:26:52-0:27:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:26:52):**  more fundamental than that to the business. So that's been a really good outcome for our  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:27:00):**  business, the visibility of the business. And there's been so many people in the local  
**[0:27:04-0:27:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:27:04):**  industry who have been interested in getting on board and looking at not just some of the  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:27:11):**  emissions reduction we're doing, but some of the on-farm activity that we're doing.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:27:16):**  Because you drive past our vineyards and things look a little bit different to our neighbours.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:27:21):**  And you know how people are in industry, sometimes they can give a peek over and say a thing  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:27:26):**  or two that they think maybe we need to get the weeds under control and you actually walk  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:27:31):**  them through and you go, no, these aren't actually weeds growing, this is something  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:27:34):**  we've established yet. And they still kind of think you're a bit nuts. But the interesting  
**[0:27:40-0:27:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:27:40):**  thing is watching the outcomes. And more and more people, I think, are coming onto this  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:27:47):**  style of farming and talking less about yields and talking more about profitability. And  
**[0:27:53-0:28:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:27:53):**  you know, those numbers don't lie. Everybody wants to reduce their inputs on farm and reduce  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:28:00):**  their exposure to risk. And if you can come up with a system which is a bit more self-managing  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:28:06):**  in some of these ways, but also that's really good for soil health and good for sustainable  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:28:11):**  farming, there's a generation of people that are getting on board with it.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:28:17):**  You make it sound both so obvious to do this and pretty easy. So I'm tempted to ask you  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:28:21):**  what's either been hard or what do you think prevents others from doing this?  
**[0:28:26-0:28:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:28:26):**  That's a really difficult question to answer. You know, I think in a general sense, one  
**[0:28:33-0:28:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:28:33):**  of the biggest issues with the broader industry of farmers not looking as much about the soil  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:28:40):**  health is because you can see when you look at the spreadsheet of the business, like where  
**[0:28:46-0:28:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:28:46):**  money comes from, people look at the land that they have in front of them and they are  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:28:53):**  trying to make a profit off of it. That's basically the bare bones of it all at the  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:28:58):**  end of the day. And when it comes to things like, you know,  
**[0:29:04-0:29:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:29:04):**  soiling carbon in the soil, some of the benefits to it, they seem sort of so distant to people  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:29:11):**  in the methods of farming that they're doing now and the machinery that they've invested  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:29:15):**  into to do that. You know, if you have a huge amount, you've invested in a large piece of  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:29:21):**  machinery that has its life cycle, that has its expected amount of use you expect to get  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:29:27):**  out of it. So going and changing that midstream can be like financially damaging to people  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:29:32):**  who are expecting to get a return on their investment in the machinery that they use  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:29:36):**  and in the processes they use. So it's more than just a technical thing. It also goes  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:29:42):**  into, I think, the way that people are running their business and the equipment that they  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:29:47):**  have to do it. At a more macro level, Alastair sees other  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:29:51):**  barriers for farmers, which are also opportunities for innovators and perhaps policymakers.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:29:57):**  The other thing from, I think, is a larger picture is that this idea that there are lots  
**[0:30:05-0:30:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:30:05):**  of businesses in Australia which are seeking to eliminate or offset their carbon emissions.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:30:13):**  There are very few people who are actually doing this sequestration in Australia successfully.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:30:19):**  And the one thing is that there is this real uncoupling between carbon sequestration markets.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:30:27):**  The markets are a bit ad-lib, to say the least. So what we really need is properly set up  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:30:37):**  carbon markets. We need a real carbon market in this country that lets farmers see the  
**[0:30:43-0:30:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:30:43):**  value in storing carbon in the soils, increasing organic soil carbon, seeing forested parts  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:30:49):**  of their property as an asset, potentially. Because if there are companies out there,  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:30:55):**  if there are industry out there, and now we're looking at the government itself looking at  
**[0:31:00-0:31:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:31:00):**  emissions reduction and eventually reaching carbon neutral status by some point, whenever  
**[0:31:07-0:31:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:31:07):**  that is, it is farmers who should stand to benefit the most by seeing value out of carbon  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:31:14):**  sequestration on their lands. That's really part of the answer to this big problem. So  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:31:19):**  the joining of these things together, which are on their own, not being monetized properly  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:31:25):**  and pulling together is going to be something that's really massive for Australian agriculture  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:31:29):**  when it eventually happens.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:31:31):**  Yes, and hopefully exciting times to unlock more of that. But it feels like there's a  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:31:35):**  whole groundswell of this. Interestingly, you mentioned the technology and you're actually  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:31:39):**  headed off to, I think France, is it, to go spend a bunch of time where there's completely  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:31:43):**  no technology? Tell us about that.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:31:46):**  Yeah, I'm really excited by this. So my partner and I are kind of old enough to do our own  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:31:53):**  thing but young enough to not have too many responsibilities. I'll be working at a producer  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:31:59):**  in an area called Cote Rote about half an hour south of Lyon. The slope of some of those  
**[0:32:04-0:32:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:32:04):**  vineyards to give people a bit of context is about 40 degrees. So there's no tractors.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:32:10):**  There's no tractors, just very strong calf muscles.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:32:13):**  Hopefully.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:32:14):**  Yeah. All of the vines are spaced out meter by meter on wooden stakes and the property  
**[0:32:21-0:32:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:32:21):**  I'll be working for is a seven hectare domain and everything is done by hand. So I'm really  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:32:28):**  looking forward to seeing how that management works because, like you were saying, with  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:32:33):**  technology and the way that we have agriculture in Australia is so mechanized to see how an  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:32:38):**  agricultural system works completely free of mechanization, I think is really interesting.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:32:43):**  There's a lot that we can learn, a lot that I can learn from witnessing that and seeing  
**[0:32:48-0:32:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:32:48):**  the style. They make beautiful wines, so there must be something to it.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:32:54):**  That sounds awesome. I'm excited to hear what you learn and I'm sure it will be a lot of  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:32:58):**  fun as well and probably a bit of work, it sounds like too.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:33:00):**  Yeah. Yeah. It'll be plenty of work, but that's one thing about the wine industry and viticulture  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:33:08):**  is that the work at least you can take some real pleasure from.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:33:11):**  Cool. Alastair, thanks so much for joining me. I really, really appreciate it. This was  
**[0:33:15-0:33:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:33:15):**  awesome and I just think it's really cool what you're doing and I will be looking for  
**[0:33:18-0:33:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:33:18):**  the wines now because I'm one of those consumers that wants to buy this stuff too. And we'll  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:33:22):**  put links in the show notes as well.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=583983#t=0:33:24):**  Thanks Sarah. Appreciate it.

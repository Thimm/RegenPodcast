### Agtech - So What?  (2020-04-22)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome back to the Ag Tech So What! podcast brought to you by Agthentic.  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  Today's episode is a slightly edited recording of the first national virtual Ag Tech meetup.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:00:15):**  The topic?  Alternative proteins.  Three guests, a chef and cellular agriculture entrepreneur, a chemistry PhD and disruption  
**[0:00:23-0:00:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:00:23):**  researcher, and an internationally recognized veterinary immunologist and inventor each  share five minutes of their thoughts on the alternative protein space, and then we have  a discussion, or I guess maybe more of a debate.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:00:37):**  We cover what these products are, what's driving their cost, when they'll hit the market, and  how much market share they'll actually get, and what all of this means for farmers, investors,  and all of us as consumers.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:00:49):**  There's a lot to cover, and during the event we had slides and shared some resources.  All of this is available on our website at agtechsowhat.com.  Please check it out.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:00:58):**  Like at an in-person meetup, we share a bit of community news and then jump into the event.  So we have just launched the Australian AgriTech Association, which is an initiative across  Australia and meant to be across all sectors for the benefit of AgriTech, really looking  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:01:15):**  at placing Australia in the center of this opportunity, helping with both local community  building and collaboration, as well as attracting external investment and positioning Australia  as a leader in terms of the knowledge and innovation that we can produce.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:01:29):**  So hop onto the website there and you can check it out.  So what can you expect from tonight?  This will be the last bit for me.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:01:36):**  I mean, alternative protein is something we've been hearing about, that it will be the biggest  disruption that big food companies, ag companies, tech companies are investing millions and  billions of dollars, and that agriculture will fundamentally change.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:01:51):**  But there's also plenty of skeptics about that feature and evidence that says the technology  is too expensive, the business case doesn't stack up or it's not nutritious enough, or  it's just a small niche percentage of consumers.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:02:04):**  And then there's folks, I suppose like us and probably many of you that are somewhere  in the middle that believe there is a protein gap that's really big and that will need many  types of protein to fill it.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:02:14):**  And that doing so, especially here in Australia, is a massive opportunity.  And we're excited to bring all three of those perspectives to you tonight with our experts  on this panel.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:02:24):**  So in terms of what they'll talk about, they'll talk about will alternative protein go mainstream?  What the rise of alternative protein means for producers, including meat producers?  And what are the opportunities and what are the risks if we get this wrong?  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:02:39):**  Our experts have really different backgrounds and really different approaches to this space.  So you can expect frank conversations.  We had a great prep chat and managed to keep them from not fighting, but we'll see how  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:02:49):**  we go tonight.  Not everyone will agree though.  We will try to keep it evidence-based and not too technical.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:02:55):**  And ultimately we really hope that you learn something new and that maybe it challenges  your views on this space or inspires you to take an action that will benefit yourself  or your business.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:03:05):**  So with that, I will turn it over to our first panelist to give a bit of an interaction on  yourself.  So I'm Catherine from Rethink calling in from the UK, I believe.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:03:17):**  Hi everyone.  Yeah, so I'm Catherine and I work for RethinkX, which is a startup and independent think tank  looking at technology driven disruptions.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:03:26):**  My background is in finance for 10 years and a PhD from Cambridge university before then.  So at RethinkX, as I said, we study historical disruptions and forecast coming disruptions.  So what is a disruption?  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:03:39):**  It's when a new product, business or service helps create a new market and significantly  diminishes transforms or destroys an existing product market or category.  And disruption is not destruction, right?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:03:49):**  The destruction of the horse with the car created whole new bigger industries and new  jobs.  So it's important we do not underestimate destruction as the cost of missing out can  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:03:59):**  be huge.  So for example, in 1985, AT&T asked McKinsey to project cell phone penetration in the US  in the year 2000.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:04:06):**  They estimated 900,000 subscribers, but the actual number was close to 109 million.  They were off by 120 times and as a result missed out on tremendous wealth creation,  which of course other companies seized.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:04:18):**  So at RethinkX, we look at technology disruption through a framework, laying out our blueprint  for analyzing and anticipating disruption.  So one pillar of this is we know that technology cost curves fall fast and at exponential rates.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:04:32):**  So for example, in biotechnologies like genome sequencing, cost improvements are leaving  improvements in informational technologies represented by Moore's law on this graph for  dust.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:04:42):**  And we've seen this in action just recently where it's taken just weeks to sequence the  various strains of COVID-19.  The next pillar is technological convergence, which acts as a common catalyst to make disruptions  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:04:52):**  possible by enabling products, businesses, and services with certain functionalities  at a certain cost just not available before.  And there are loads of examples of these, the car, the household refrigerator, and the  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:05:02):**  smartphone, just to name a few.  But all these products have continued to improve in capability with the most modern versions  of these looking sometimes very different to those first examples.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:05:12):**  And this continued involvement in capability of these disruptive technologies is important  as the point of disruption does not mark the end of improvement.  The next pillar is that we see a lot of linear projections, but no technology in history  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:05:24):**  has ever been adopted linearly.  Technology gets adopted as S-curves and adoption happens seemingly slowly then reaches a critical  mass which is usually around 10 to 20 percent or tipping point and they explode before slowing  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:05:35):**  down again.  Again, something that a lot of people are familiar with now after COVID-19.  And in the meantime, the cost of the technology continues to go down exponentially.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:05:46):**  The mainstream analysis failed to see S-curve disruption.  This is the IEA projection of solar PV starting in 2006 and the black line is reality and  the other colored lines in the forecast, which are linear despite solar now being one of  
**[0:05:58-0:06:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:05:58):**  the cheapest forms of energy.  The final pillar of disruption, our disruption framework is business model innovation.  The whole on demand or app culture that we know today from Uber to Airbnb to Netflix  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:06:10):**  has just come about in the last 10 years and has come about from technological convergence.  We don't think food is going to be any different.  We anticipate a complete business model transformation of the food system with a completely new value  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:06:21):**  chain which we call food as software.  How we design, develop, produce and distribute food will change and the company's leading  this and not necessarily the incumbent players, but the biotech and information tech companies  
**[0:06:32-0:06:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:06:32):**  behind the scenes.  In our food report, we focus on the convergence precision biology and fermentation into a  technology we call precision fermentation.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:06:41):**  It will allow us to harness microbes as mini biological factories to produce any protein  at high speed and volume.  We can program microbes to produce any specific protein or molecule we desire.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:06:52):**  And protein is not just food.  It's in the enzymes in washing powder, in cosmetics and shampoo or the core building  blocks of leather.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:07:00):**  Precision fermentation can be used for any molecule as well.  There are startup companies making products from palm oil, coffee, sugar substitutes,  bricks and indigo dye all in fermentation units.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:07:11):**  Precision fermentation has been disrupting protein production for 40 years starting with  human insulin, humulin made by yeast in 1978.  Disruption was rapid and followed an S curve reaching more than 95% adoption in just 13  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:07:23):**  years.  The technology has improved further with humulin itself being disrupted by other human analog  insulins.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:07:29):**  So how is this going to disrupt the cow?  Well, it starts with gaining critical market share to build the industry, bring the cost  curve down and reach that tipping point.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:07:38):**  And these products are being made now.  And these are products that we cannot extract from nature like human proteins, milk, collagen  and insulin, or proteins that are simply too expensive to extract often from plants, indigo,  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:07:50):**  or rasine, and proteins from extinct plants and animals.  At RethinkX, we do forecast cost curves and precision fermentation is no different to  other technologies.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:08:00):**  We anticipate the cost to produce one kilo protein will be $10 per kilo by 2025.  And a really interesting thing starts to happen when we reach this cost point.  This is when we're cost competitive with bulk protein sourced from animals.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:08:12):**  What kind of animal proteins?  Well dairy proteins like casein and whey.  The ability to make these specific identical proteins is a game changer and where precision  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:08:20):**  fermentation and plant based products differ.  In precision fermentation, you are making the exact same protein in abundance.  Disruption will be driven by the B2B market.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:08:31):**  Think Nestle who buy 1.6% of global milk supply, not to go into milk, but products like lasagna  and chocolate.  And precision fermentation is going to allow Nestle to buy these dairy proteins cheaper,  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:08:41):**  also less volatile supply and locally produced just to put into these products.  And in the US, this B2B market is huge, 35% of the total dairy market ends up in use as  an ingredient.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:08:52):**  And replacing these with the exact same proteins means introduction will be rapid as we've  seen in the past.  For ingredients, think cheese on a store-bought pizza or lasagna or used in food service or  
**[0:09:02-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:09:02):**  restaurants.  For example, 50% of US butter and cheese is used in these industries and has been decimated  by the global coronavirus crisis.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:09:10):**  And a quick question, I'll come back to it at the end, is how much of US cheese market  do you think ends up on a pizza?  And this leads us to the idea of market trauma, which is when technologies can disrupt the  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:09:20):**  economics of an incumbent industry way before they have any kind of market share, be it  10%, 20% or 30%.  Small changes lead to rapid feedback loops favoring the new technology and seeing trauma  
**[0:09:31-0:09:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:09:31):**  to the old.  And US dairy is seeing this twofold, two high profile dairy processor closures a few months  ago from just a few percentage points change in demand, as well as the impact from COVID-19.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:09:42):**  Now imagine what a tenfold decrease in prices could do.  And this is what precision fermentation is, a tenfold improvement in efficiency from everything  including energy, water, time.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:09:53):**  And this is an order of magnitude and will translate to cost.  The cow will simply be unable to compete.  These feedback loops are why we forecast precision fermentation and its enabled industries will  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:10:03):**  grow rapidly and by 2030 have 70% of the US market with just 30% of protein coming from  cows.  Competing this into the number of cows mean we expect 50% in the US by 2030.

Before I get into what cultured meat is, where it is and who Vow is, I wanted to quickly  touch on what cultured meat isn't.

They're replicating the experience using very different ingredients.  Cultured meat on the other hand is a very different approach that's not yet on the market.

We breed and we raise animals to maturity, slaughter them, take the flesh of that animal  and then discard the remainder of the carcass.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:11:41):**  That flesh is made up mostly of skeletal muscle cells alongside some fat cells and connective  tissue cells and a few others.  Cultured meat is exactly the same thing.

So cultured meat is a way of making exactly the same thing we eat today.

Another driver of this is there was no real investment in this sector seven years ago  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:13:30):**  and so far in 2020, since the first of January, there's been over $160,000,000 invested in  these cultured meat companies by private investors alone and likely more by governments around  the world.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:13:43):**  One of the really compelling characteristics of cultured meat is any animal flesh can be  produced using this method.

But there's a bigger opportunity than just a production technology here.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:14:16):**  And at Vow, our focus is not on producing the things that we're familiar with.  Rather, it's on crafting a new category of food using this technology.  If we're going to go to the effort to learn how to do tissue culture to create food, why

So our approach is to build a library of cells that come from both domesticated and undomesticated  species.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:14:42):**  This library ultimately becomes a repertoire of new ingredients that we can be drawing  on to create an essentially limitless range of new types of food.  This includes both exotic species, which could never be industrialized.

**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:15:08):**  Imagine mixing the skeletal muscle of kangaroo with the fat cells of salmon with the liver  cells of beef to create something which is high in protein, high in omega-3 and micronutrient  dense.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:15:19):**  That's the long-term vision for Vow, but we are a very young company.  We were founded almost exactly one year ago.  In fact, it was our birthday last Friday.

We're now a team of nine.

So thank you to all those people out there.  We don't have a society unless we have food, and that's why this is such an important topic.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:16:19):**  So I call out to them.  And just to remind people who don't know, in Australia, we produce enough food to feed  60 million people.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:16:27):**  So there's no need to panic.

Now back in Australia, sitting on boards like the Dairy Australia board.  So let's move from the theoretical to the real and talk about where alternative proteins  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:17:12):**  fit in.  So I definitely believe there is a space for alternative proteins in the food systems,  but I'm a believer that they're really a niche product.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:17:22):**  They're not going to overtake mainstream, livestock produced products.  And in reality, a lot of them, just let's think about the plant-based products.  We used to call them vegetables, and now we call them alternative proteins.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:17:36):**  So that's fine.  So there's a bit of competition out there, and that's what you've got to match up to.  So that's really the debate.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:17:43):**  It's not whether they should exist or anything, it's that they do exist, there's a place for  them.  But is it mainstream like Catherine believes, or is it niche?  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:17:52):**  So let's have a look at some of those issues.  And I think the biggest problem is really that they aren't the solution for the growing  world population that you hear some people start.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:18:01):**  I think everyone knows we're going to grow to nine or 10 billion people.  We actually know where those people are going to be.  They're going to be in Africa, they're going to be in parts of Asia.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:18:11):**  And if you look at Africa alone, we've got over a billion smallholder farmers.  So the definition of that is they earn less than $2 US a day.  So they're out there feeding their families and growing a bit of protein, whether it's  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:18:24):**  plants or animals.  And alternative proteins, as you've heard described, are not going to solve their problems.  Price alone is an issue, let alone a lot of other issues we can get in.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:18:35):**  So we're talking about a set of products that are really for people who can afford choice.  So I get a little annoyed when I hear people start with, we're feeling the new population.  You're not.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:18:47):**  So, and we've also got in Africa, we've got 150 million children who have micronutrient  deficiency.  And one egg a day or a glass of milk would solve that problem entirely.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:18:58):**  So what we're going to see in those countries, and it's the data is actually that the sales  of meat based product or animal based products are increasing exponentially because they  need to eat more animal based protein for their nutrition.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:19:13):**  We're seeing a market that is quickly saturating for alternative proteins.  Interesting alone, the Grains and Legumes Council in Australia did a survey last year,  137 plant based meat substitutes on the supermarket shelves a day, 137.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:19:31):**  Bit of competition out there today, even before you get started with anything else.  Most of them on average had about six times the amount of sodium.  So we can get into the debate about nutrition, but there's some nutritional issues there  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:19:44):**  against natural products as well.  We get into the growth in the market, vegans, vegetarians around four to 12%, depending  on whose figures you believe, been pretty static for a while.

And by the nature of flexitarians, they flex in and they flex out.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:20:06):**  So you wouldn't want to put your whole gala on them, continue to buy your product.  We produce a lot of high quality, nutritious, delicious animal based proteins, and people  will continue to eat those.

So they're actually very good at converting pasture that's not arable land and into a  product that you can eat.

That's why they're very popular in places like Africa.  So I suppose overall what we do need is a balanced discussion towards this whole issue  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:21:02):**  about food security.  We can get into the issue about Catherine's view about where precision fermentation.  I've spent my career in industry.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:21:11):**  I know a bit about fermentation.  I would distinguish particularly between bacterial and yeast versus cell based.  There's a dramatic difference in cost of production for those things.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:21:22):**  So we need to think about that.  And to be honest, the industry you don't want to be in is the commodity.  After all, what we're talking about is competing with a burger, competing with mincemeat.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:21:32):**  This is at the bottom of the red meat area alone.  So $6 a kilo out of the US.  In the shops here, I just looked up today, about $10 a kilo.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:21:46):**  It's a tough space to be in.  Generally when you go out with new technologies, you want to be in high value spaces where  you're going to get return on your investment.

Let's take a bit of the hype.  Beyond went up to being a $14 billion business.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:22:03):**  It's now down to about $4 billion.  So $10 billion has been taken off the table already.  So there's a little bit of hype in there.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:22:10):**  Impossible just did a great raise, $500 million raise.  But all of those raises are pretty insignificant compared to the actual investment in the food  industry.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:22:20):**  So off a low base.  And we'll get into the really good report out of AFI recently, saying much the same  as I'm saying.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:22:28):**  And that is, if you look at where food and protein supply in Australia is going, these  products are really going to be in that 10% of the market share.  So as I said, I actually believe in alternative proteins.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:22:40):**  They just have a different view of what they're going to do to transform the food security  systems around the world.  So Sarah, I might leave it at that.

**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:22:54):**  With those initial thoughts from the panelists, we get into a discussion that gets quite heated.  Given this is a super complicated space with lots of technical terms, I start by asking  George to give us an overview of the different types of alternative protein.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:23:07):**  Yeah, absolutely.  So if you've gone into a supermarket or you've gone into a burger joint and you've had a  veggie burger, odds are that's going to be something like a soy protein.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:23:17):**  And these products have been around for decades.  We've had these textured soy proteins on the market for a really, really long time.  They have been up until recently, pretty much the most repulsive category of foods I can  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:23:27):**  imagine.  Only in the last five or six years did some newer tech companies come in and say, well,  there's an opportunity to make some really extraordinary products here.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:23:36):**  So we've had companies like Impossible and Beyond, which spent literally years deconstructing  what makes meat, meat and rebuilding that from the ground up from a molecular level.  The Impossible burger took that to another extreme.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:23:49):**  They took textured soy protein processed from soybeans and basically extruded as a protein  concentrates with much, much higher protein than the plants that go in.  And then they used a bacterial system to express hemoglobin or lehemoglobin from soybean root  
**[0:24:06-0:24:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:24:06):**  nodules that they add into that burger.  So you essentially create a burger which has real hemoglobin, the same thing that makes  meat red, that makes it cook to that brown color and makes it bleed.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:24:17):**  So you end up with this product, which is a plant based burger that is so compelling  and realistic in its appearance and its flavor and its texture.  And this is really the first generation of products we're experiencing now that have  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:24:30):**  been deconstructed from meat and rebuilt from the constituent molecules.  That category is on the market and widely available.  Then there's cultured meat and that's what we work on at Vow.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:24:40):**  This is a new category.  No one is commercial anywhere in the world with this product yet, but there is a lot  of work going into it because it is real meat.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:24:47):**  It gets around a lot of the arguments that if you want to eat meat, just eat meat and  moves into this new territory where all of the downsides of meat, all of the problems  that people have, which are legitimate problems around the ethics of animal agriculture and  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:25:02):**  the environmental footprint, especially of factory farming outside of Australia, you  can avoid those and still get to enjoy the meat products that are so desirable.  There's also some other categories.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:25:13):**  I'm just going to mention one very, very quickly, which involve this almost like alchemist approach.  There's crazy companies in Finland which are using solar power, water, and CO2 to create  literally bulk protein from thin air.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:25:27):**  We're right at the start of the new generation protein products.  Think of where we are now as like the first iPhone.  No one really wants it, but in 10 years, we're all going to have one.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:25:36):**  We have a new generation of plant-based proteins like the Impossible Burger, and then there's  cultured meat or cellular agriculture as some call it, which is what George's company, Vow,  is doing.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:25:47):**  There's one more term that you'll hear a bunch on this episode, and then I want to quickly  explain.  That is recombinant protein.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:25:54):**  Basically, it's a genetic manufacturing process where you can create large volumes of protein  by taking DNA from an organism and placing it into a genetically modified bacteria or  other cell type.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:26:07):**  So recombinant protein isn't just for food.  It can be used for medical or industrial applications.  Insulin, for example, is made this way.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:26:15):**  In food, the key thing to remember is that recombinant protein makes parts of whole foods  rather than whole products like with cultured meat.  The hemoglobin or heme in the Impossible Burger that George mentioned, for example, is a recombinant  
**[0:26:27-0:26:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:26:27):**  protein.  Other companies like Perfect Day use a recombinant protein as the way in their ice cream.  Though these products are in market now, I've actually eaten an Impossible Burger, no one  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:26:39):**  in the cultured meat world has been able to get the cost down enough to actually produce  a cellular agriculture product for us as consumers at a reasonable price.  Catherine believes the costs will fall though and will fall rapidly, but Paul shares a different

Yeah, so look, I read Catherine's report, the RethinkX report, and so I was intrigued  by why they thought it might be reduced.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:27:03):**  I sourced the information on fermentation costs to a report by the Good Food Institute,  and I went and had a look at that report in 2019.  First thing I was struck by is they made a couple of assumptions in putting price together,  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:27:16):**  which I think are totally wrong.  So the first assumption they made was that the media you use to sell culture is about  20% the cost of manufacture.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:27:25):**  Well, it's actually about 20, you know, so they said it was 80, it's actually about 20.  So it's a pretty big assumption there that is just blown away.  They also didn't include capital costs in there, you know, 20,000 liter, water jacketed,

It is about 250,000 US, and then you've got to put it into a room that has to have positive  pressure because you want to keep microbes out of it.

George, maybe not surprisingly, disagrees on how production costs will drop and when.  Paul, you're entirely right.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:28:24):**  These were expensive products 20 years ago, but Impossible used about 1% of their final  ingredient weight is a purified recombinant lehymoglobin.  And that just dropped from, what was it, $6 a pound to $4.50 a pound in the US.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:28:40):**  We're talking about a product which contains a meaningful amount of a purified recombinant  protein, which is very close to being price competitive with beef.  Today, as a seven-year-old company, project forward 10 years with even a small advance  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:28:53):**  in technology, and that is going to be very competitive with commodity beef in the US.  There's also companies like Perfect Day and Geltor, which are also doing food-grade dairy  proteins.

Given these are foods we're talking about here, taste is a big factor.  Catherine explains what her research found about both taste and price.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:29:30):**  So when we look at disruption, we always think, as I mentioned at this point, about how capabilities  continue to improve.  We do see things like the Impossible Burger, which has 2% of recombinant protein in.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:29:41):**  That's version, in fact, they call their latest release version two.  Now imagine when we get to, just as we have with iPhones, version 10, 11, 12, and we do  think this will continue to get better.

This is what we call food as software, this idea of developing and making food better,  which we see anyway in food all the time.

There's a couple of questions coming through in the chat that I want to make sure we get  a chance to address.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:36:52):**  One for you, George, is around your comment on exotic species and other animals.  And in light of coronavirus, there's a conversation going on around, is there challenges with  animal agriculture generally, but specifically exotic species?  
**[0:37:05-0:37:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:37:05):**  So if you want to comment, maybe clarify how you guys are approaching this and comments  on the use of exotic species in Vazwerk.  That's a really, really difficult question.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:37:16):**  From the perspective of exotic species, the reason we're going down that avenue is because  ultimately we think these combination products are going to be the thing that wins in the  market in the long term.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:37:24):**  In the short term, selling any single exotic species into any market on the planet, it  is a scary, dangerous thing to do because it's essentially a validation by a new technology  industry of the quality of that existing product.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:37:37):**  There was a company, I may misquote this, so please call me out if I do get this wrong,  but there was a company in the US that was working on cultured rhino horn for the Chinese  medicine market to reduce the consumption of rhino horn in China.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:37:49):**  When they launched that product or even when they announced that product, the market for  rhino horn increased because it was seen as a Western validation of the medicinal value  of real rhino horn.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:37:58):**  And so if we are going to go into this world of selling exotic products to try to deliberately  displace these markets, we would have to be incredibly careful about how we did that in  order to be responsible to the thing we're trying to achieve, which is reducing the consumption  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:38:09):**  of animals out of those wet markets and not encouraging that trade by being seen as a  validation of the quality of those products.  Great.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:38:17):**  Thanks, George.  So the next one is from Clive Blacker.  These new methods of growing and culturing food have the same levels of protein, fats,  
**[0:38:27-0:38:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:38:27):**  vitamins that natural products have.  And there's kind of a broader question there around nutritional profiles and some of the  pushback on alternative proteins against the nutritional composition.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:38:36):**  Yeah, sure.  One of the really interesting parts about all of this alternative protein, and it's  true whether we're talking plant based cultured meat or even some of those crazy like making  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:38:45):**  protein from thin air like the guys at Solarfood is you essentially have a recipe as Catherine  says is this isn't a product which has to be grown in one homogenous animal that needs  all of those cells together to survive.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:38:56):**  We can produce these things and bring them together in ways that otherwise couldn't.  So we can effectively control all of the different nutritional properties independently from  one another.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:39:05):**  So if we make a pork which has no saturated fat, we can absolutely do that in a way which  you can't by changing animal management practices in a farm or in a feedlot.  This nutrition question is an important one, given we all want to eat food that's good  
**[0:39:17-0:39:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:39:17):**  for us.  But it's not yet clear how this will work for alternative proteins.  I think the nutrition one is still an open debate.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:39:26):**  There's really not the nutritional data yet on a lot of these products other than the  caution about the sodium levels.  I think we've still got to see what the nutritional data is going to look like.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:39:35):**  Yeah, I was going to say I agree with George.  I think I mean I think what we'll see is just a whole lot more transparency about all food  and the nutrition value of makeup of all food including animal protein, animal products.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:39:48):**  So I think that's how what we advocate for is a more open transparent system and better  labeling be it like based on much more environmental or nutrition.  So we do advocate for that because we think that is incredibly important to this system  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:40:00):**  that it is nutritionally better or equivalent.  So what is the rise of alternative proteins, however big or small they ultimately become  and however expensive they ultimately are, actually mean for farmers?  
**[0:40:14-0:40:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:40:14):**  So there are some opportunities.  So let's look at the V2 product that's come out CSIRO and Hungry Jacks.  So you know they're building a $20 million plant at Wodonga for that because unfortunately  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:40:24):**  the products they use in the V2 burger aren't predominantly grown in Australia.  So they're an important product at the moment.  So there are opportunities and I think I said up front there's always opportunities for  
**[0:40:35-0:40:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:40:35):**  alternative proteins.  Where I really draw the line is Catherine's projections around that they'll take over  the market.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:40:42):**  I don't think there's any data for that really at all.  I think the report from AFI is a good one.  It says you know that there's a great opportunity for more protein supply.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:40:53):**  Overall I think they quoted at about a $19 billion growth in value.  Three billion of it they put to alternative proteins.  The majority of that is to animal-based proteins.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:41:04):**  So you know it's a balanced report.  It goes into a fair bit of detail about consumer trends, et cetera.  It's a good one to look at if people want to look at a detailed report.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:41:14):**  It's focused on Australia about what the future of protein supply is going to be.  So you know its conclusion in the end is that these are not a risk.  They're just other products coming in the market but they're not really going to challenge  
**[0:41:28-0:41:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:41:28):**  the traditional products, which have long histories of quality nutrition, et cetera.  Thanks Paul.  Catherine, what opportunities do you see, especially any for farmers?  
**[0:41:40-0:41:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:41:40):**  I think being aware of these changes and how they might impact you are so important.  I mean obviously I disagree with Paul a lot on the timing but even if you think we're  half right, it's going to be huge changes to the whole system and there definitely could  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:41:53):**  be a threat.  So I think just keeping an eye on those price levels, the costs of the new technology, these  products coming on the market and these products that aren't plant based, right?  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:42:01):**  We're talking about the exact same products and I think it's very different to make sure  we do differentiate between those two.  We personally don't see plant based as being, we don't really take it into account in our  
**[0:42:12-0:42:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:42:12):**  report because we don't necessarily see it as a better version of what we're talking  about.  So I think just being aware of it, perhaps thinking about your feed stocks and how you  
**[0:42:21-0:42:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:42:21):**  could even change.  I know there's lots of people in Australia and I'm sorry for my ignorance in the Australian  farming community, making a lot of wine and how you can maybe pivot and think about what  
**[0:42:29-0:42:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:42:29):**  you can produce in order to support these new industries.  So yeah, I think, sorry for my incomplete answer.  It's not my specialty.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:42:37):**  No, that's alright.  I like the wine angle.  There was people talking in the chat around other opportunities that you extended shelf  
**[0:42:45-0:42:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:42:45):**  life, thinking more about consumers creates and that's really aligned with how a lot of  us are thinking about the agri-tech opportunity in Australia in terms of the knowledge economy  and the ability to harness a lot of the innovation we've done in many agricultural sectors and  
**[0:42:58-0:43:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:42:58):**  take advantage of it.  So, sorry, just to reply a little bit, the gene pool that you guys have of all your animals  and products is going to be extremely important to the knowledge base of these new products  
**[0:43:10-0:43:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:43:10):**  too.  So like just being able to kind of capitalize on what the knowledge that you guys have.  Definitely.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:43:16):**  George, thoughts on opportunities for industry.  So in Australia, I honestly believe we couldn't be better placed to take advantage of alternative  protein.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:43:27):**  Paul, early on you said you think alternative protein is going to be a niche.  Australian livestock products are a niche with 3% of global beef production.  That is absolutely a niche product.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:43:38):**  What we have an opportunity to do here in Australia is use things like plant-based products.  As you mentioned, Paul, V2 is building a factory locally to turn agricultural commodities into  finished value added products to export.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:43:49):**  We can do a lot more of that across plant-based, across recombinant proteins, cultured meats  and other emerging bio-based food industries.  Use this as a magnifier of our agricultural output.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:43:59):**  Take in huge volumes of sugar, soybeans, other legumes, value add those onshore and end up  being an exporter of 10, 20, 30% of global protein production rather than being a niche  player, but a very high performing, high quality and sustainable player in global livestock  
**[0:44:14-0:44:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:44:14):**  production alone.  And on that somewhat positive note, we'll wrap up here.  There were dozens more questions in the chat and so much more that we could cover on this  
**[0:44:22-0:44:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/4/22/episode-65-the-alternative-protein-debate-live-from-australias-first-virtual-national-agtech-meetup#t=0:44:22):**  topic, but hopefully this gives you a taste of the live meetup and a bit to think about  around alternative proteins on both sides of the fence.  We tried to keep this discussion evidence-based and have some frank conversations that go

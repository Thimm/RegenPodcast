### Agtech - So What?  (2019-08-21)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the Ag Tech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly  changing the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting  started, but there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:00:21):**  ag and ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring  you the story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where  ag and tech meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Today's episode is the fourth in the theme  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:00:47):**  Responding to Climate Risk, brought to you in partnership with the Australian Farm Institute.  Check out episodes 42, 44, and 46 to hear more about responding to climate risk. Our  guest today is Peter Thompson. Peter is a farmer based in southern central Queensland.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:01:04):**  He runs grass-fed beef cattle and crops about two and a half to three and a half thousand  acres. The property is two adjoining blocks, one of which has been in Peter's family for  70 years as of this year. They also have another 6,000 acres of wilderness. I met Peter recently  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:01:21):**  and he's one of those guys that you just want to hear from. In just a quick chat over sandwiches  at a conference, I could tell that Peter had a ton of stories to share and lots of hard-earned  experience. In this episode, he shares a few. We talk about echo cattle, their operation,  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:01:38):**  and the regenerative practices that he and his wife, Nikki, are using. We cover the impressive  list of technologies they've adopted and Peter's outlook for Australia in a world with increasing  climate variability. Given the theme around climate risk, I didn't expect us to start  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:01:52):**  off talking about coal seam gas, but that is indeed where we'll start.  It seems to be a love it or hate it relationship. We've got well number seven of the first 10  that were ever drilled here in Australia in the coal seam gas industry. Nikki and I took  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:02:08):**  the very conscious decision that we loved where we were, we wanted the land looked after,  understood that the world needs energy. Had still there in the background, the biggest  open cut coal mine in the Southern hemisphere is still touted for about 20 kilometres east  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:02:23):**  of us. We're hoping that we'll never go ahead, but with the coal seam gas, we've got these  40 wells across the two properties that we put a lot of work into ensuring that everything  about the industry, the protection of the land and water were our number one priority.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:02:41):**  Number two was air livability and number three was the agricultural production off there.  So we said, right. If we've got those principles in place, let's see how we can make it work.  And we've been fortunate to be able to develop good work and relationships with people outside  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:03:00):**  of agriculture. Unlike in the US in Australia with freehold  land, farmers only own the first 12 inches. They don't have a say in what happens below  that because it's owned by the crown. Peter took a very pragmatic approach that ultimately  
**[0:03:14-0:03:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:03:14):**  earned benefits back for echo cattle. We said, right. Oh, well, we need the energy.  I've given numerous talks around the country and I say that when the lights come on and  those three holes in the wall, it's not magic that's happening behind there. It's actually  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:03:32):**  something that's been produced somewhere else. And the initial approach was, we'll give you  a few cartons of beers and some tickets to the football and we might put a few gravel  rides in. And our view was, well, hang on, you need to put your gravel rides and grids  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:03:49):**  et cetera to get around your infrastructure and tickets to the football and whatever didn't  really interest us. So we were also instrumental in getting the system change from a literally  a pittance that was only tens of thousands of dollars a year on the, so we've got 40  
**[0:04:10-0:04:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:04:10):**  wells that was only going to amount to about $40,000 a year payment to us. And we've actually  developed a compensation package where it amounts to hundreds of thousands of dollars  a year and becomes a very substantial support, obviously through dry times, but it's just  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:04:35):**  been really valuable.  There were a few takeaways from this experience for Peter around collaboration and how to  compromise to achieve outcomes, but without compromising the wellbeing of the land and  
**[0:04:46-0:04:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:04:46):**  water. But despite Peter's focus on both financial and environmental outcomes, some are skeptical  that echo cattle really is farming regeneratively. That's why echo cattle has an open door policy.  Peter and Nikki invite people to come along and take a look for themselves.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:05:04):**  We've always had an open door policy and we've had the most ardent opposition to tree clearing,  to gas, to beef cattle, you name it, people will come and stay with us, visit a few days  or whatever. And the comment is we didn't know, we didn't understand, we didn't realize  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:05:25):**  this visit has totally changed my worldview.  Do you have any examples of someone who came in with one view and ended up saying that?  There's literally been numerous and it still happens to this day. We've got friends who  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:05:38):**  are very actively involved in the likes of World Wildlife Fund, Australian Conservation  Foundation, all those sort of groups. It's that lack of context and the removal from  reality that so many people, unfortunately, worldwide, the urban areas have become so  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:05:56):**  far removed from where their food is produced and how and why things have to be done. And  the fact that you're dealing with nature.  Peter is passionate about educating others about agriculture. His own journey has been  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:06:10):**  one of challenging the status quo, thinking for himself and working hard to figure out  the practices, technologies and mindsets that will work for their operation.  As a young bloke along with my father, I was practicing regenerative agriculture before  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:06:26):**  the word was even known and then sort of got caught up in the whiz-bangery of new machinery,  new techniques, herbicides, ultra-clean paddocks, going for yield productivity, all the things  that are still happening. My view is that's sort of the high production, low human input  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:06:48):**  thing. We'll probably go on for a while yet, unfortunately, but I think we're waking up  to the fact that it isn't long-term sustainable. So we didn't ever get fully on the bandwagon  of, in fact, of one national wheat growing competition back in 1999. And we've used zero  
**[0:07:06-0:07:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:07:06):**  till techniques. But one of the questions asked of me was, what did I think of zero  till? And I said, there's a place for it and it's not here. And one of the major sponsors  was Monsanto and Agrivo and Australian Wheat Board were all involved. And I don't think  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:07:26):**  that was the answer they necessarily wanted. But anyway, that's the answer that we're given.  And I've been very wary of silver bullet solutions to anything in agriculture and for that matter,  anything in nature, because nature is just the most amazing thing for how it adapts.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:07:46):**  And as we humans think, we've started to master it. And I know when I was younger, I used  to even use the terminology, are we going to beat this or master that or whatever, take  control. And the older I've become, I've realized that that's an incredibly foolish way to operate.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:08:08):**  It's about listening to nature, listening to land, and then working with what it's doing.  Peter has adopted a few practices that, at the time, seemed crazy to many. But despite  the controversy, some of them are really paying off, both financially and environmentally.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:08:26):**  We've been grass-fed beef producers, and even beef production. At the moment, there's all  sorts of noises made about how beef cattle are killing the world. And there's another  whole view that particularly grass-fed beef production can be one of the greatest carbon  
**[0:08:42-0:08:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:08:42):**  sequesters out there and provide food at the same time. And I don't believe I'm biased.  I think I'm actually realistic in saying that it's a very natural process. And we've got  data to back up a couple of things, one around clearing timber. So where we are, we're in  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:09:01):**  Briglow, Balaw country, very fertile. Briglow trees, when you clear them, come back, because  hair's on the dog's back. So we manage them in a manner that allow the grass to grow.  And in our case, we don't try to kill it. We just want to keep it at a managed, balanced  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:09:18):**  level. And we're seeing doublings of soil carbon levels and producing food at the same  time, rather than a lot of the carbon offsets that are happening at the moment. The country's  being locked up. And literally, the people are leaving and communities are dying. That  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:09:36):**  because people are taking the cash, running away, and we've got all this country that's  literally being locked up and growing trees that without management have got wildlife  going. Berserk, Underwood, and once again, it's this stuff that's being pushed from an  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:09:54):**  outside group of people that don't actually understand the reality of what I can do here  in southern central Queensland will be different to what we need to do in the Gulf country  compared to wheat fields of Western Australia.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:10:07):**  Peter believes that there's no silver bullet, no single approach that is the answer when  it comes to best practices. But things like willingness to ask questions and try new things  are critical in helping Peter to respond to climate risk.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:10:22):**  I've always been keen on change. And to me, if you can be part of change, rather than  change swamping you or catching up on you, it can be just the most exhilarating ride  because you can be in there trying new things.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:10:40):**  Peter shared one example of this kind of thinking in his cattle operation around HGP's or hormone  growth promotes. Again, Peter and his wife, Nikki, were really ahead of the curve with  respect to consumer preferences.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:10:52):**  We took a decision to not use the being HGP's hormone growth promoting being used and everyone  was getting all these amazing results out of it. It just didn't feel right to Nikki  and I. Anyway, we took the decision that we were going to be grass fed, not using HGP  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:11:11):**  and you certainly copped a lot of, you stupid bloody idiot, can't you see there's a lot  more dollars using HGP's. So you copped a fair bit of negative commentary from people.  But it was about two years after we made the decision not to use HGP's that all of a sudden  
**[0:11:28-0:11:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:11:28):**  the world woke up and there's like coals for instance, you won't buy HGP treated cattle.  So it sounds like you did that before you knew if there was any kind of premium or any  kind of even real market for it, but that it paid off. And is it true that you guys  
**[0:11:44-0:11:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:11:44):**  do now get a premium for it?  Yes, we got a premium and then as everyone caught up with it like so often happens in  agricultural products, it then becomes commoditized because everyone's doing the same thing. And  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:11:56):**  very literally as we speak, we're in the stage of looking at the next, you could possibly  describe it as niche market. There are people out there who are prepared to pay a premium.  And actually I think that Moore is prepared to pay the correct price for well cared for  
**[0:12:14-0:12:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:12:14):**  livestock and crop production that has come from land that has been cared for with concern  for the land being sort of first and foremost.  Beyond innovative practices, Peter is also working with technologies. For example, he  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:12:30):**  has experimented with walkover weighing. This was part of a project with Future Beef, Queensland  Department of Agriculture and TruTest. At the conference where I met Peter, the topic  of technology on farm came up. Peter wrote out a list of all the tech at Echo Cattle.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:12:45):**  And it was so long that he even surprised himself. So I had to ask Peter to repeat the  list here on the podcast, which was top of mind as they had just hosted a field day on  their farm.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:12:56):**  We've had GPS steering for many years. We've got a satellite base station, RTK sorry, base  station, which gives us our 25 millimetre accuracy on the tractors. We've also got a  thing through Case New Holland where I can literally call up the dashboard of the tractor.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:13:13):**  There's times when I've been away and on my iPhone, I can just log in and I can see exactly  where the tractor is, what it's doing, just as I was sitting on the tractor. So that's  a remote monitoring of it. It also has enough various alerts there. So that's one part.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:13:29):**  Another is we've got 12 remote sensors on water bores and water tanks. And we had a  good example this morning. In fact, we had a height burst and we didn't know what had  happened. We noticed that a water tank got an alert that it was dropping quicker than  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:13:46):**  it should for the number of cattle that were watering off it. We're about to go and check  out what was what and some people working with us rang to say that they'd found a busted  polypod. So we've got those monitors that are monitoring all our watering points. And  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:14:01):**  out of that, we've got data that then tells us what time of day cattle are watering, how  much they're actually using. And then with the walk over weighing system, because that's  on a water point, we're getting white gains of cattle, but we're also getting some interesting  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:14:17):**  stuff about the fact that some cattle actually only water every second and some every third  day. And it's a whole new field to look into. We're fortunate that we have 4GX mobile phone  coverage over a lot of the place, the part of the place where we had the hundred people  
**[0:14:33-0:14:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:14:33):**  in the field day tent near our main house. We use self-i-go repeaters in the houses to  get a good signal because we're behind down in the hollow behind a lot of trees and local  company Advanced Communications came out bought a mobile satellite dish and created a Wi-Fi  
**[0:14:54-0:15:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:14:54):**  hotspot and a couple more self-i-goes so that we had the capability to handle 100 people  all at this field day asking questions and the stuff that you would be used to in the  city off their phones. We were doing that 80 kms from anywhere. Recently bought a drone.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:15:13):**  I mean, I've been keen on drones for ages, but I think they're more a backup to monitoring.  They're certainly not the be all and end all that drone sellers will tell you, but they've  certainly got a place in the tech side of it. And big one we're using is every five  
**[0:15:29-0:15:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:15:29):**  days satellite imagery, 10 metre pixels measuring our pasture growth or not, which we're using  for working out feed budgeting. So we know how many days feed we've got ahead of us  in a particular paddock with certain cattle in there. You're looking at all the different  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:15:48):**  tech we've got. There's a whole lot of things that are really good, but that water  monitoring, which is so critical with livestock and particularly in dry or summertime, they  will pay for themselves in no time in peace of mind and in value and is a really good  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:16:03):**  starting point for people. And that doesn't cost the earth.  Tell me about the pasture growth modelling. Like that's something that feels like the  Holy Grail. Tell me a little bit more about that.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:16:12):**  It's bloody wonderful stuff. We've only been using that imagery for about four months now,  so it'll take a couple of seasons, but I can see where we'll get to the point where  we can very reliably say we've got 7,000 kilos of dry matter per hectare in that paddock.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:16:33):**  We've got 2,000 in another. There's a whole lot of stuff that we're already getting  beneficial use out of it. And also picking up, I call them hotspots and green spots so  that you can physically drive right or whatever out to the point and see what's happening  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:16:50):**  on the ground. Or this is where I have found the drone comes in handy that you can fly  the drone out, have a look. It might show up simply having a look through the imagery  on the drone or you say, no, I've actually physically got to go and have a look. We've  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:17:05):**  either got a weed problem or whatever it might be. So we're 18,000 acres. And from memory,  it's only a couple of thousand dollars a year for this every five days. All this detailed  stuff. I've been following this for years and it's about five years ago. I priced our  
**[0:17:24-0:17:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:17:24):**  original home block. 10,000 acres was going to cost me $12,000 a year for three images  a year. The cost of that side of tech has come, like so much tech stuff, has come way,  way down, but it's also getting way, way better.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:17:43):**  One benefit of the fact that technology is decreasing in price and increasing in performance  is that more services are available, especially in regional areas. We often talk about the  ag tech that enables productivity, but I wanted to talk to Peter about another tech, technology  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:17:58):**  that enables quality of life because having happy people on your team is key to taking  on the challenges that are involved in responding to climate risk.  It's only a couple of years ago that Netflix was seen as, you know, in a meeting you'd  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:18:13):**  be scoffed at and wasted time, whatever, whatever. But in this day and age, if we want people  to live and work in regional areas, you know, we don't work 24 hours a day in agriculture  as much as some diehards of agriculture like the rest of the world to think, you know,  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:18:32):**  we do take time off. We do need to relax. It's all part of mental and physical wellbeing.  And we don't have the opportunity to go down the road to a movie theatre or a live theatre  or whatever. So Netflix and the likes plays a really crucial role. And it's to the extent  
**[0:18:49-0:18:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:18:49):**  that, you know, I know different people where that if they haven't had the ability to provide  free wifi and the likes of Netflix, that staff simply will not stay. It's, it's just become  an expectation. And that used to be scoffed at whereas, and I'm pleased to see that people  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:19:14):**  are starting to realize that it shouldn't be scoffed at. It is something that, you know,  there is a real need for it.  One thing that I learned from Peter and that he has learned on his journey is the importance  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:19:26):**  of the bigger picture. We can talk about climate change and ag tech all we want, but at the  end of the day, whether producer or consumer, we have some tough decisions to make about  how we spend our money and our time and how we run our businesses.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:19:39):**  As a world, we can't keep consuming at the rate we're consuming that the production methods  that we're using, we can't keep that going. Look, we could be running our operation very  differently and I'll say making a bloody fortune, but I like to be able to lie straight in bed  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:19:58):**  at night and think there's a future for the kids. And so it's, it's about people just  stopping and really thinking about the impact of, are they living for today or are they  living on tomorrow, yesterday?  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:20:12):**  What do you see in terms of kind of climate risk and that you guys are facing and the  role of technology in kind of helping respond to that climate risk that you guys would be  experiencing, whether that's kind of things you've seen in the past couple of years or  
**[0:20:25-0:20:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:20:25):**  when you think about the future?  So climate risk, it's real. And the thing that I believe we've got here in Australia  that we can share with the rest of the world is the ability to deal with variable climate  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:20:38):**  because that's something certainly Northern Australia has always been and there's plenty  of data around the fact that we are the most variable climate in the world. So if we can  monitor and measure the things that we've been doing to deal with that and then can  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:20:55):**  share that with the rest of the world, well that has to help dealing with the here and  now of the volatility. But I see that technology being able to give us the ability to help  people understand and connect people so that they realise that it's not me as a farmer  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:21:14):**  doing whatever might be perceived as bad for the environment. It's you and me and everyone  else that eats and drinks and lives. We're all complicit in it. So if we can virtually  connect everyone and connect people back and might be as simple as me flying the drone  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=415816#t=0:21:31):**  out and showing people what we're doing and doing that as a live feed, just those sort  of things, I believe, give us a chance to turn around. I still believe we've got time,  significant time to turn things around if we start now.

**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:02:15):**  And I just genuinely don't know.

**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:02:56):**  You say ag tech, but I think it's the actual, it's the incumbent organizations, retail manufacturers

**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:03:13):**  And now they haven't actually given even the field facing staff or tried to create any

**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:04:06):**  of the argument is it basically minimizes churn for the big platform companies.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:04:12):**  So the fear of missed opportunities, like, dude, they're not making any money from your

**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:04:23):**  They're already paying somebody to do remotely sensed analytics to get whatever they need.

**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:04:34):**  So something bad will happen to me now that I've given somebody else all this data.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:04:38):**  Again, have already done it, right?

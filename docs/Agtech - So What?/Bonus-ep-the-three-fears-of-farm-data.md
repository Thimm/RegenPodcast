### Agtech - So What?  (2022-05-11)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to another bonus episode of Ag Tech So What.  I'm Sarah Nollet.  In our work at Tenacious Ventures and throughout our careers, we've spent a lot of time thinking  
**[0:00:13-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:00:13):**  about the possibilities of digitally native agriculture.  We like a lot of others believe there is huge potential for the global ag sector to not  only become more efficient, but also to limit its often detrimental impact on landscapes  
**[0:00:26-0:00:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:00:26):**  and thus the climate, and yes, even to provide benefits.  On the other side of the conversation, of course, are the barriers to digitally native  ag, and often it seems that there are many.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:00:37):**  But there's been one barrier that we've been thinking about a lot lately, that despite  all the hype, we think is actually maybe not a true barrier at all.  This particular barrier is the crux of the conversation we wanted to share with you today,  
**[0:00:51-0:01:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:00:51):**  one that features myself, my business partner, Matthew Pryor, and the insightful Shane Thomas,  who among other things is the author of Upstream Ag Insights, an ag tech industry newsletter.  We wanted, well, really Matthew wanted, to talk to Shane about his suspicions that one  
**[0:01:06-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:01:06):**  of the most frequently debated issues around digitally native ag is not what it seems to  be.  That issue, whether farmers should be afraid of sharing their data and more generally should  
**[0:01:16-0:01:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:01:16):**  be worried about data ownership.  A brief warning here at the top, this was not a planned podcast interview, so you might  notice it's not quite as scripted and clean as most of our episodes are.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:01:27):**  We wanted to experiment with giving you, our listener, a kind of fly on the wall, or in  this case, eavesdropper on the Zoom call, insight into how we think, from how we form  our ideas and opinions to how we check their validity and determine what's next.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:01:40):**  We hope you enjoy this slice of ag tech investor life, and if you don't, we'll let you know  how to tell us at the end of the episode.  For now, I'm going to drop you into the thick of things, at the moment where Matthew first  
**[0:01:49-0:01:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:01:49):**  explains his theory.  We as in the ag tech community have completely f***ed farmers by making them afraid of sharing  their data.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:01:59):**  And in reality, what is going to go wrong?  I don't get it because if I want to know what you've got, I can just task a satellite and  I can know it.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:02:09):**  If there's some economic advantage, I've already got access to it.  So what are you worried about?  And I just genuinely don't know.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:02:18):**  A couple of good examples that someone could give me of real harm that a farmer could face  based on somebody else having given them, so we're talking about farm level data, right?  Field scale directly measured farm level data versus remotely sensed farm level data.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:02:36):**  And in the world where remotely sensed farm level data is basically free, daily, in high  vision, why are we telling farmers that they should worry so much?  It's funny, I've had this conversation with numerous groups too, with that same frame,  
**[0:02:53-0:03:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:02:53):**  because it comes down to it.  You say ag tech, but I think it's the actual, it's the incumbent organizations, retail manufacturers  that have been worse, because they use that narrative to scare people from call it defecting  
**[0:03:07-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:03:07):**  over to FBN or to somewhere else.  And so they started that narrative, in my opinion, or at least reinforced it.  And now they haven't actually given even the field facing staff or tried to create any  
**[0:03:18-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:03:18):**  sort of marketing initiative to support their staff, to be able to go out and have a conversation  with a farmer that, hey, there isn't anything negative.  And the upside is actually much greater than the downside, because if you have data sitting  
**[0:03:31-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:03:31):**  there, it's not worth anything.  I mean, it's like having cash under your mattress, but worse.  I mean, you need to associate that data with some sort of insight that delivers a better  
**[0:03:39-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:03:39):**  outcome for your farm, your operation.  We need to associate it with a specific asset, whether that's a ton of grain or whether that's  this soil itself.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:03:47):**  That's the benefit side, right?  So what we're saying is you're not getting any of the benefit because you're worried  about something that's not a thing.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:03:56):**  Agreed.  Yep.  I just don't understand it.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:04:00):**  And I get it, the churn, so maybe that's a good point, which is the self-serving nature  of the argument is it basically minimizes churn for the big platform companies.  So the fear of missed opportunities, like, dude, they're not making any money from your  
**[0:04:15-0:04:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:04:15):**  data, right?  There is no missed opportunity.  And if they can monetize your farm data, they're already doing it.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:04:23):**  They're already paying somebody to do remotely sensed analytics to get whatever they need.  So forget that one.  The second is fear of unintended consequences, right?  
**[0:04:34-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:04:34):**  So something bad will happen to me now that I've given somebody else all this data.  Again, have already done it, right?  Like if you're flogging your country, if you're polluting your waterways, or if you're doing  
**[0:04:46-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:04:46):**  something that you don't want people to know about, they already do, or they're going to  soon enough and your bank's going to actually demand that you tell them what you're doing  anyway.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:04:55):**  So forget that.  So the third, which I think is the key one, which is loss of self-determination.  I've submitted all my machine data to whoever, and they won't let me get it back, or they  
**[0:05:09-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:05:09):**  won't give it to me in a way that I can move somewhere else.  We talk about the first two, but it's actually the third one that is the only one that actually  has any merit.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:05:20):**  That once I commit to a platform, I can't easily move off it because the vendors don't  make it possible.  So it's really nothing to do with, you know, consequential loss.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:05:33):**  It's nothing to do with missed opportunity.  It's just churn and locking.  So it's, yeah.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:05:38):**  So you're saying the biggest factor is the switching costs or the switching penalty to  it and the lack of optionality.  And so they're scared to commit to something because all of a sudden you don't know exactly.  
**[0:05:48-0:06:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:05:48):**  That's a generous description.  The less generous description is it's actually benefits the platform players to have farmers  scared about the first two because it locks them in and it relieves pressure from the  
**[0:06:04-0:06:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:06:04):**  vendors to have to make it possible to move away from their platform.  So that's Matthew's basic theory that the narrative around data privacy and ownership  in production agriculture is not, rationally at least, about actual missed opportunity  
**[0:06:17-0:06:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:06:17):**  or the risk of unintended consequences.  The simple reason is because in farming, the factory has no roof.  Quite literally, the skies over the world's farm fields are full of incredibly high tech  
**[0:06:27-0:06:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:06:27):**  satellites that can get the vast majority of a farm's most relevant or at least most  lucrative information without ever visiting.  But this reality is rarely at the core of discussions on farm data.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:06:39):**  The most legitimate fear that's discussed is that a farmer might sign up for one platform,  put all of their data into it, and then be locked in and unable to easily switch platforms  if the current one fails to meet their needs.  
**[0:06:51-0:07:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:06:51):**  Here's Matthew adding some additional color on why that easy switch is actually a bigger  barrier than it might seem.  So we also have this framework about when we talk about data, what actually is, what's  
**[0:07:02-0:07:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:07:02):**  the point of sharing data?  And it's not, you don't share it.  There are a couple of different ways that data can be useful between systems.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:07:11):**  So you've effectively got interchange, which sort of means I can take data, put something  from my system and send it to another system, but it's not like real time.  It's just like maybe a field boundary.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:07:22):**  And so I've got field boundaries in climate and they're also useful to my tasking system.  So I want to send tractors here and there, and it's useful to have field boundaries.  The second is interoperability.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:07:35):**  That's like real time.  So that's exactly what LEAF is doing.  So in real time, you've got data and it's typically bi-directional.  
**[0:07:43-0:08:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:07:43):**  And the third is, I don't know what you want to call it, but migration.  The third is I am moving away from platform A, migrating all of my data away from platform  A to platform B. And so it's that third scenario that the vendors don't want to support.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:08:01):**  They have commercial reasons to support interchange and interoperability, but that there's no  commercial reason for a vendor to support migration.  In, yes, out, no.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:08:14):**  And so in that world, because that's churn and they don't want churn because they've  applied the Silicon Valley template of ARR based on subscriptions.  So in that world where vendors really don't want pressure around migration, it's actually  
**[0:08:28-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:08:28):**  in their interest to have farmers think that the real issue is that someone will do something  bad with their data.  Trust us, but don't trust anybody else.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:08:40):**  We won't cause you any harm.  If we make money from your data, we'll share it with you.  And oh, by the way, that means we don't have to do anything about migration because we  
**[0:08:48-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:08:48):**  can lock you in and lock your data away.  I follow that.  I'm wondering if, are you saying that that's why farmers go on and then they don't use  
**[0:08:58-0:09:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:08:58):**  it or engage in the actual utilization of the platform?  That's a separate issue.  I think there are a couple of classes of farmers.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:09:06):**  One class is those who just don't take up or don't engage or trial, but that's a value  creation problem, right?  But it's probably inhibited by these fears.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:09:20):**  I call them unjustified fears, right?  We've created all of this unjustified fear around missed opportunity and consequential  harm because the narrative for that basically supports vendor lock-in and relieves the true  
**[0:09:38-0:09:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:09:38):**  pressure, which is that the industry has to do better around migration.  Because if you think that the fundamental psychology for a farmer is I've already got  risk out the wazoo.  
**[0:09:53-0:10:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:09:53):**  And so the risk of getting locked into a single vendor and just being a price taker for their  subscription is material and real.  And then as a consequence of all of this fear, most of it unjustified, except for the migration  
**[0:10:06-0:10:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:10:06):**  fear, which is justified because vendors don't want to support it, then none of the true  benefits get unlocked.  And that's a premise, which is that as an industry, we've created this narrative, this  
**[0:10:19-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:10:19):**  false narrative around missed opportunity and consequential harm.  When in reality, if we just got off our asses and fixed migration, we would see adoption  skyrocket.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:10:31):**  Interesting.  I hope that's the case.  But the piece I'm missing is I want someone to explain to me why I'm wrong about the unjustified  
**[0:10:47-0:11:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:10:47):**  nature of the fear, but I just can't think of a scenario where there's a justification,  a commercial and economic justification for being worried about unintended consequence  or being worried about missed opportunity.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:11:01):**  Like it's just not a thing as far as I can tell.  Yeah, no, I can't argue with what you're saying.  I've always thought about it as like a death by a thousand cuts and there's a part of that.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:11:12):**  But I think what your points are that this is a disproportionately big aspect of that,  that doesn't get talked about enough.  And just knowing how much of a pain it is, I've seen files that are supposed to be exported  
**[0:11:25-0:11:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:11:25):**  that it's like, oh, here farmer, here's your data.  But now you're getting a bunch of basically useless that you can't use Excel files or  some crazy thing.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:11:33):**  So then nobody wants to deal with that.  Even if you can get it out, which I know companies that didn't build to export data properly  and didn't build to actually integrate, obviously with other platforms or other systems.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:11:45):**  And so you have that problem on top there too.  So yeah, it could be the biggest portion for sure.  Yeah, but the kind of end point there is that leaf shouldn't be needed.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:11:57):**  This is actually what creates the opportunity for leaf is because they're kind of, I don't  mean to be bagging on them in particular, but just the fact that a company is needed  here and that they're this kind of private arbitrage between these vendors who just don't  
**[0:12:13-0:12:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:12:13):**  get it.  They're literally cutting off their nose to spite their face.  By continuing this narrative around fear and continuing to take a naive view around migration,  
**[0:12:25-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:12:25):**  they're actually lowering total adoption of digital farming.  Yeah.  Well, in my mind, every company in their own way should have the capabilities to do what  
**[0:12:36-0:12:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:12:36):**  leaf does.  And to me, almost to your point, you really shouldn't necessarily need a leaf, but regardless,  that's where we're at.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:12:43):**  So theoretically, if there was a semi-os or whoever the company is that made it so seamless  so that this is wrong though, because one company could make, try to make themselves  open and engage with everybody else, but you need everybody else to participate in that  
**[0:12:55-0:13:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:12:55):**  in order for that to come to fruition.  So you can't actually have a market winner in that instance, because it almost is like  a game theory situation.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:13:03):**  You need somebody else to come in and make that decision there with you.  But so that's where leaf comes in.  I know it sounds like Matthew is being a little harsh here, but we want to clarify that we  
**[0:13:12-0:13:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:13:12):**  don't believe that this narrative was created or being perpetuated out of malice or as the  result of some kind of ag tech industry-wide collusion.  I actually think the reason why these narratives became so dominant was much simpler because  
**[0:13:24-0:13:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:13:24):**  ag tech as a sector lacked or maybe still lacks the confidence and credibility to say  anything other than we understand your fear and we're here to take care of you.  A more realistic, though also more nuanced and hard to communicate message would have  
**[0:13:38-0:13:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:13:38):**  been we understand why you might have this fear, but here's why it's unfounded and you  don't actually need to worry.  But if you're on a marketing team and in need of engagements and signups, especially if  
**[0:13:48-0:13:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:13:48):**  you're still in the process of building a company, brand and reputation in ag, the second  message is almost impossible to deliver.  Matthew agreed.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:13:57):**  Yeah, I think that's a good point in terms of the maturity and complexity and yeah, like  simple arguments win even if they're false.  I think the reality is the tech industry generally solves this in a more commercially pragmatic  
**[0:14:13-0:14:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:14:13):**  way in that you tend to get kind of kiretsus of vendors who collaborate well.  I'll sneak in here to say that kiretsu is a Japanese term for a mutually invested group  of companies that work more or less together in the marketplace around shared interests.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:14:29):**  So you've got portability or good levels of interoperability in exchange.  Migration still is not typically all that well supported, but I think the difference  possibly between tech and ag tech is tech is tech first.  
**[0:14:46-0:15:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:14:46):**  And so it's just because it's all software and they're all purely software products,  then it just tends to be the case that APIs and data just have a higher precedence in  terms of things that people worry about.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:15:03):**  And typically the buyer is more sophisticated in their understanding of data and portability  and migration.  And so to some extent that's an interesting direction to come from, which is perhaps it's  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:15:18):**  a buyer education problem.  Absolutely.  And who wants to take on that challenge?  
**[0:15:23-0:15:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:15:23):**  Because taking on that challenge is your fears are wrong and we're going to educate you about  why software can solve your problem.  Like no marketing department ever takes on that challenge.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:15:31):**  It's much better to go, we're right, you're afraid.  We've got you covered.  We totally get you.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:15:35):**  Look at all these Iowa farm kids on our team.  No worries.  The other one I was going to say to your point about a kiretsu.  
**[0:15:42-0:16:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:15:42):**  Cause the other thing we talk about is like the value propositions just haven't been strong  enough to justify change in some of these cases.  And so when we get to in setting an offsetting or sustainability link loans or like areas  
**[0:16:00-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:16:00):**  where the drivers for doing stuff are stronger, how does that change the ecosystem?  And so does that mean we'll have kiretsus that evolve within use cases or within supply  sheds or within industries?  
**[0:16:14-0:16:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:16:14):**  And I think that's an interesting forward-looking question because the incentive to have the  conversation and to put yourself out there is higher when it's like, there's just such  a stronger driver in some of these cases, then just the we'll digitize your farm data  
**[0:16:29-0:16:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:16:29):**  kind of use cases we've had previously.  When you're talking about like, where's the kiretsu going to come from and along what  lines would the kiretsu form?  
**[0:16:39-0:16:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:16:39):**  Then I think that's where you bring in the platform versus application frame.  And say to get a full vertical integration, like a virtual sort of platform because they  were framing platform versus application on a per company basis.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:16:57):**  But in actual fact, a kiretsu is a virtual application where a small set of vendors collaborate  to put industrially specific debt for a virtual application.  And you could say, yeah, is that likely to be grains specific?  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:17:14):**  Is that likely to be market specific?  Is it likely to be supply chain or supply shed?  Yeah.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:17:20):**  And it's interesting, right?  Because the people who are in the quote unquote best place to do that now in the sustainability  carbon space would be like the verifiers.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:17:27):**  And they're the least digitally savvy of any of them because they can say, Hey, everyone  plug in this way or moved out of this way, but they're like busy filling out their pieces  of paper.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:17:39):**  Do you guys look at the bushel Amazon, whatever else they have?  Do you look at that as like the start of a kiretsu or do you look at that as...  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:17:50-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:17:50):**  That's what I was probing at there, which is that along what lines, so Sarah's question  was what would be the basis for the formation of a kiretsu?  A technical definition is common shareholding, right?  
**[0:18:03-0:18:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:18:03):**  That's what's the kind of ag equivalent of common shareholding.  Is it crop?  Is it kind of supply chain like end to end application?  
**[0:18:12-0:18:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:18:12):**  There's a technical element, right?  Which is where an Amazon or a Microsoft would come in and then there might be like an incentives  kind of alignment, which is doing that for the purpose of having end to end recognition  
**[0:18:26-0:18:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:18:26):**  of ecosystem credits or something like that.  That's the definition of a market almost like we've wasted all this time thinking about  written specifications and haven't thought anywhere nearly enough about actual digital  
**[0:18:40-0:18:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:18:40):**  transformation.  I mean, what's the point of having a method written down if there isn't digital infrastructure  that makes the method really easy to comply with?  
**[0:18:50-0:18:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:18:50):**  You get to really interesting thinking along those lines of is the upside enough to justify  building any of this software, doing any of this stuff?  And then if so, who builds it?  
**[0:18:59-0:19:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:18:59):**  Cause you, you move pretty quickly away from like venture scale and yet you've got, I'm  soil works came to mind with you're trying to do this maybe with a meat processor and  master map and blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:19:13):**  And so is it like a new model of corporate innovation that can catalyze this or a new  model of cooperatively owned startup innovate?  Like who, who does this stuff?  
**[0:19:24-0:19:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:19:24):**  That's where, so that's why I think Regen Farmers Mutual is super interesting.  If you do an incentive alignment and you tokenize that marketplace and mint the tokens, then  the early partners and the cost of initial development is paid for, I mean, struck price  
**[0:19:45-0:19:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:19:45):**  tokens.  And then the more people who participate, if they then have to bring the fiat in to  acquire the tokens that they need to participate, then token value increases.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:19:58):**  And the original minters of the tokens get paid by value appreciation in the underlying  token economics.  So it's the re-emergence of the Guild, right?  
**[0:20:12-0:20:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:20:12):**  That's the, where the kind of Guild is digitally formed.  And that's why I reckon Regen Farmers Mutual and Orry Corp for that matter in Australia  are two super interesting.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:20:24):**  But talk about conversations that don't make sense to have with farmers.  That is one of them, right?  It's just, who pays for it and what kind of return do you get there?  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:20:32):**  I'm not sure I agree.  Cause if you think about how co-ops used to work, who built the silo?  Sure.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:20:38):**  Before, before you could put grain in it, before you could collectively combine your  grain and trade with more power, someone had to pay for the silo.  I'm not saying it doesn't make sense or farmers aren't sophisticated enough to fully understand  
**[0:20:52-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:20:52):**  it and have it be aligned to their incentives.  I'm just saying thus far, those conversations have come from a place of absolute snake oil  salesmen if there was a spectrum, right?  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:21:02):**  Challenge is like, who's well suited to do that.  It's someone with existing industry trust and credibility.  So then it's okay.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:21:08):**  Is this the digitally native industry organization?  And then you've got like advocacy and things built in because you've got the data to just  say, we're not polluting or here's much, how much chemicals we use or whatever.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:21:19):**  And like the world in which those organizations digitally transform in this way.

Winfield probably is the one that's the most progressive out of all of those.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:22:01):**  You might have a grow mark that's close behind, but Winfield, they may be having to done the  most in the digital side of things, but they've attempted to get the most digital capabilities  and assets invested in the technology and the educational know-how and all that sort  
**[0:22:15-0:22:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:22:15):**  of thing.  So it probably would be Winfield and they obviously came together through a number of  different I call it consolidations and mergers and that sort of thing over time.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:22:25):**  But to your point, they are large and well-trusted and it started with being a co-op and they  got to that point.  Now I don't know.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:22:32):**  I don't know how field would look at something like that.  They probably wouldn't do it.  I mean, that's classic question though, right?  
**[0:22:40-0:22:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:22:40):**  Because you, at some point you have the Tesla versus BMW kind of question, right?  There's a category creation opportunity and that doesn't mean that one of the incumbents  doesn't eventually transform enough to have very strong prospects of surviving into the  
**[0:22:59-0:23:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:22:59):**  future, but it will be a lot of pain along the way.  And the digital native, the Tesla, if it's appropriately capitalized and executes well,  can literally grow to be.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:23:13):**  Maybe this part of the conversation where we dove into Keiretsu's and the question of  how to overcome the lack of economic motivation for making migration easier might seem a little  beside the point, but for us, this really is the so what of the conversation.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:23:27):**  The real actionable insight in the widespread fear, heavy air quotes there, around farm  data ownership is not that farmers are fearful of farm data writ large.  It's that the fear narrative is a marker for a tech problem, one that if solved would be  
**[0:23:40-0:23:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:23:40):**  a tremendous opportunity, not just in terms of market dominance, but in leading the ag  sector overall.  In other words, the farm data fears won't be cured by a company paying huge sums of  
**[0:23:50-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:23:50):**  money to buy farm data or by a Fort Knox level guarantee of privacy.  It'll be overcome by the player or players who are willing to give their customers the  most freedom.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:24:00):**  We did though in wrapping up each have a few closing thoughts.  Here's Shane.  I'd be curious, like I've never actually heard a farmer of course, explicitly say that's  
**[0:24:08-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:24:08):**  why.  So it'll be interesting to see how your questions, how that pulls answers out of them.  They don't use the words loss of self-determination when you ask them.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:24:17):**  Yeah.  Most people don't talk like that in English.  Even just the more basic aspect of it of, Hey, I'm scared that I'm not going to be able  
**[0:24:24-0:24:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:24:24):**  to get my data out.  Cause it's as you guys know, like human psychology is weird, but that might be one of the things  that's subconsciously influencing them the most, but it, it might not come out as a answer  
**[0:24:35-0:24:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:24:35):**  and even the top five reasons, but there's all these different answers.  And to be able to pull something specific out of that as to what really is driving,  it's easy to say, Oh, there's a lot of different things that influence it.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:24:46):**  But if you can identify the one to three biggest fact, like obviously everybody talks about  ROI, like I'm going to beat my head against the wall.  If I hear that, of course the ROI is important, but it's like, but to look at things like  
**[0:24:59-0:25:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:24:59):**  this, I had to very, I had to exercise high levels of restraint in some of those comments.  Because you were saying that just the return isn't there to share the data.  It's like the point, the point is to try and yes, try and name something that doesn't have  
**[0:25:14-0:25:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:25:14):**  a name, right.  That we have contributed to this unspecified and unjustified fear of sharing data.  I don't know what it is exactly, but something bad is going to happen if I let other people  
**[0:25:30-0:25:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:25:30):**  have access to this, or if I start using these systems that put all of my stuff in the cloud,  we've just, we've created this dark cloud over the idea of sharing data.  Is there an element of like it's industrial era thinking, which sounds mean and everything  
**[0:25:48-0:25:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:25:48):**  I'm saying sounds like, I mean, to the farmer, I actually have a lot of empathy around it.  Like in the world where it's physical, fuck what city slickers on my farm because of biosecurity,  because of their like, it's actually a risk.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:25:59):**  And so there's this sense of what could get messed up or what kind of access could be  there that in the physical world is true.  And in the digital world, because there's like a copy of the data or because it's data,  
**[0:26:09-0:26:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:26:09):**  it's not like they're going to go in and reroute your phone buying kind of thing.  Yeah.  I think that those are legitimately separate things, which is, you know, the absolutely  
**[0:26:16-0:26:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:26:16):**  that cybersecurity has to be there.  And actually one of the things that has pushed me down this path is the narrative around  the next level of the NFF farm data.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:26:28):**  So the Australian National Farmers Federation produced a farm data code, not dissimilar  to the farm data transparent stuff, which basically says we're not going to be jerks,  right?  
**[0:26:39-0:26:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:26:39):**  It's a vendor doing a scout pledge to not be an asshole.  It doesn't even say that.  It basically just says, if we're going to be jerks, you're going to know about it.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:26:46):**  Yeah, exactly.  But now it's going into this whole narrative about, oh, we can't trust anybody.  And there's all this harm that can come if you don't control this stuff and all this  
**[0:26:57-0:27:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:26:57):**  is legal and who owns it.  And we really, we need a formal legal definition of ownership of data.  No one owns data.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:27:05):**  Like you cannot.  It doesn't make any sense.  And if you can own it, you can own the original copy, but somebody else is going to use the  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:27:11):**  copy to train their AI and their models and everything else.  And who the hell cares at that point?  Yeah.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:27:16):**  I think we've got better things to do.  And worse than that, it amplifies and reinforces the narrative for a farmer thinking there  must be something here that I should be worried about because all these groups are faffing  
**[0:27:29-0:27:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:27:29):**  on about farm data.  Like the only thing that we need to tell people is share more, you'll get more.  But that's the only thing we need to tell people.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:27:38):**  Mm-hmm.  And I think you can sit here and try to make all these frameworks and definitions and all  that, but the speed at which everything's going to move anyways, there's going to be  
**[0:27:47-0:27:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:27:47):**  new changes.  And who at what point does it end?  If their logic was correct, there would never be an end to having a reason not to look at  
**[0:27:55-0:28:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:27:55):**  using data or managing through a digital system, because there's always going to be something  that comes up that is a concern or a new concern to them.  But yeah.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:28:05):**  Yeah.  And yeah, obviously the it's gotta be principle.  I would argue that it has to be principles based, which is where that farm data transparent  
**[0:28:13-0:28:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:28:13):**  national NFF code.  And that's the right level for it to be at is we won't, or if we're doing something that  we think has the risk of exposing you to harm, then we're obliged to let you know.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/05/12/farm-data-fear-tenacious-ventures-upstream-ag-shane-thomas-matthew-pryor-sarah-nolet#t=0:28:24):**  And if we don't, we're on the hook for the harm, right?  Those are reasonable principles, but to say when we get data from your combine and then  you own this part and we own that part and we can do just that rabbit hole just goes

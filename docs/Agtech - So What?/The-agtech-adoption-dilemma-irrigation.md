**[0:00:07-0:00:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:00:07):**  Ask any farmer how important water is, and you'll hear just how much it contributes  
**[0:00:11-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:00:11):**  to their success.

**[0:00:17-0:00:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:00:17):**  developers, right?

**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:00:21):**  Though the technology is rapidly improving, we're just not seeing adoption.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:00:26):**  One recent European study found that three-quarters of farmers irrigate based on previous experience.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:00:32):**  That's a far cry from the promise of data-driven decisions, let alone fully automated systems.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:00:37):**  Here at AgTech So What, we've been digging into the agtech adoption dilemma when it comes  
**[0:00:41-0:00:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:00:41):**  to irrigation.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:00:42):**  We just released a report specifically looking at how psychology drives farmer decision-making,  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:00:48):**  and how we need to better understand psychology, not just technology, to see more uptake.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:00:53):**  To be clear, we're not blaming farmers, not at all.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:00:56):**  Farmers are humans, and we're all susceptible to behavioral patterns, such as fearing loss  
**[0:01:00-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:01:00):**  more than valuing gains.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:01:02):**  I believe it was loss aversion, is what you're alluding to, where we're more scared of what  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:01:07):**  we have to lose versus what there is to gain, and you start to shift that around, and you  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:01:13):**  can flip that around and make the conversation a lot more progressive.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:01:18):**  That's Shane Thomas, who co-authored the irrigation report with us.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:01:21):**  He's an agronomist based in Canada who writes an unmissable weekly newsletter called Upstream  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:01:26):**  Ag Insights.

**[0:01:31-0:01:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:01:31):**  out in irrigation tech.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:01:33):**  We wanted to focus on water because, well, it's a massive issue, and therefore an opportunity.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:01:39):**  As an example, in some cases today, as much as 60% of the water withdrawn for irrigation  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:01:43):**  doesn't even reach the crop.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:01:45):**  It's lost through leakage, spillage, infiltration, or evaporation.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:01:49):**  It seems obvious to say that tech can help, but when you're talking about such a critical  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:01:53):**  business decision, it's understandable that farmers don't always feel comfortable relying  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:01:57):**  on apps or algorithms.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:02:00):**  Also joining us is Ewan Friday, Chief Investment Officer at Kilter Rural.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:02:04):**  Kilter manages more than $400 million worth of Australian farmland, water, and ecosystems,  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:02:09):**  and has a strong interest in cutting edge technology as a way of delivering environmental  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:02:13):**  gains and investor returns.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:02:15):**  So the underlying premise to this whole conversation is that the business case stacks up.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:02:20):**  Now the business case is there and it stacks up and you get a return on capital by implementing  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:02:24):**  the technology, but there's an impediment because it's psychology.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:02:29):**  Ewan has seen how psychology can be a barrier many times, particularly given that changes  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:02:34):**  to irrigation often require large upfront costs, and yet the returns don't come for  
**[0:02:39-0:02:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:02:39):**  many years down the track.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:02:41):**  Well, if you think about subsurface drip tape implementation, it's a pretty expensive technology  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:02:47):**  to put in the ground, and that's probably the major impediment, even though you might  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:02:51):**  get, I'm not sure on cotton.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:02:52):**  Cotton is a big growth crop in user of water in this part of the world, and no doubt, you  
**[0:02:59-0:03:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:02:59):**  can grow cotton more efficiently with subsurface drip tape than you can on furrow irrigation.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:03:06):**  But the cost of perhaps putting in furrow irrigation, laying out your fields from scratch  
**[0:03:11-0:03:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:03:11):**  is $3,000 a hectare, and to put in subsurface drip tape at scale, you're probably more like  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:03:20):**  eight to $8,500 a hectare if you have tape that's got any sort of life span.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:03:26):**  So you've got that significant expense to deal with in terms of capital that you need  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:03:32):**  to get that return on.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:03:34):**  So it might be depending on where you are and how you operate it, but it could be a  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:03:39):**  10-20% reduction in water use.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:03:42):**  And making that case again, the benefits came down the track, but the costs are up front.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:03:48):**  Along with upfront costs, Ewan says another impediment to ag tech adoption is that farmers  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:03:53):**  sometimes don't value their own time.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:03:56):**  So if they're out there and they're running the system and they're not really taking  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:04:00):**  account of the time that is involved in doing that, and that could be saved through automation  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:04:05):**  and through implementation of technology to make things a lot more streamlined, then they're  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:04:09):**  not necessarily crystallising in their own mind the benefits that would come from that.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:04:14):**  But from our perspective, when we're looking at running operations where we are clearly  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:04:19):**  paying for labour by the hour, then we're highly incentivised to look for technology  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:04:25):**  that makes it both more efficient in terms of productive outcome, but also a lot more  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:04:30):**  efficient in terms of labour utilisation as well.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:04:33):**  That's a great point that Ewan makes there in terms of farmers valuing time.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:04:38):**  And I think it goes to the heart of that adoption point, which is often there is a confusion  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:04:46):**  between the user and the customer.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:04:49):**  And so a person who doesn't value their time doesn't value a product that saves them  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:04:54):**  time.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:04:55):**  That's Matthew Pryor, my business partner.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:04:58):**  Before that, though, he co-founded a water management start-up called Observant, which  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:05:01):**  was ultimately acquired by the Indian irrigation manufacturing giant Jane Irrigation back in  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:05:06):**  2017.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:05:08):**  This has given Matthew unique insights into what does and doesn't motivate growers to  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:05:12):**  adopt technology and change their behaviour when it comes to water.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:05:16):**  And so trying to charge them money for a product that saves them time is a circular argument  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:05:22):**  that you're always going to lose.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:05:24):**  For sure, the farmer is the beneficiary of that improved use.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:05:29):**  But if we can't crack the code on how to get to that improved use, then we see no impact.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:05:37):**  And while we have that confusion about the business model that motivates versus the end  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:05:44):**  user that participates, that's one of the main problems that we were trying to highlight  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:05:50):**  in the report is it's not just as simple as the technology.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:05:54):**  If they're just as happy to keep doing what they're doing, then we haven't solved the  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:05:58):**  total problem.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:05:59):**  The total problem is what is it that's going to motivate the behavioural change?  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:06:04):**  And it can't be a conversation about, hey, pay us 100 bucks a week and we'll save you  
**[0:06:08-0:06:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:06:08):**  four hours.

**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:06:26):**  Yeah, I mean, I think even moving out, just from straight irrigation to broadly water

**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:06:46):**  of the truck at a trough full of water to see whether there's water in there.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:06:50):**  And they will rack up hundreds, if not thousands of kilometres a week in doing so.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:06:55):**  So in the first instance, you might say, oh, well, look, that's such a waste of time in  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:07:00):**  soil this system and you'll save time.

**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:07:07):**  But when you reframe that in terms of looking at the actual diesel use, and so you're literally

**[0:07:23-0:07:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:07:23):**  didn't do and look at the litres, literally the hundreds of litres of diesel that you'll

**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:07:35):**  and they're there on station and they're 100 kilometres away from anything else.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:07:40):**  So talking about saving their time isn't helpful.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:07:43):**  But reframing the conversation about the maintenance job that didn't get done and the 150 litres

**[0:08:21-0:08:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:08:21):**  Yeah, I mean, again, we kind of teased at this and I think that of all places, Australia  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:08:29):**  should be the place where that's most true.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:08:33):**  And yet we just haven't seen that.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:08:36):**  So theoretically, it's true and practically every, especially for temporary water, every  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:08:43):**  mega litre you save is a mega litre that you can market.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:08:46):**  And so there is a real economic value.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:08:49):**  But I think certainly my experience has been it's the time period between when you make  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:08:57):**  the decision to win the economic outcome is available to you.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:09:01):**  That's the problem.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:09:02):**  It's not that the dollars don't stack up.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:09:05):**  But there are, of course, examples of irrigation tech that is being adopted.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:09:09):**  And a big key has been a flexible business model that helps to maximise profitability.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:09:15):**  Here's Euan again.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:09:16):**  We've been, you know, we've certainly come to a view that it's sort of horses for courses,  
**[0:09:22-0:09:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:09:22):**  different technology for different crops.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:09:24):**  So we got to a situation where we'd moved from having people up in the middle of the  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:09:29):**  night going around opening gates to get water out to operating the entire system from their  
**[0:09:34-0:09:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:09:34):**  IPATs and you know, that's a huge difference to both quality of life, OHS, all sorts of  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:09:41):**  both monetary and intangible benefits that come from the adoption of technology.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:09:46):**  Ultimately, it's all about whether you can make it pay.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:09:50):**  So we're always desperately looking for ways to lower the cost of this technology adoption,  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:09:57):**  looking at different ways.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:09:58):**  In fact, we've been using different models, like a higher model on cheap surface tape  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:10:04):**  that we can recycle with the manufacturer to be growing things like organic processing  
**[0:10:09-0:10:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:10:09):**  tomatoes.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:10:10):**  We can't grow them in the same place more than once.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:10:14):**  So we've sort of got into a total cost of supply model where they'll give us, you know,  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:10:19):**  we'll keep the pumps in the head mains and they'll give us the tape on essentially a  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:10:24):**  fee for service basis.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:10:25):**  And we just factor that into our gross margin and say, OK, that's that.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:10:29):**  We roll it all up at the end, it goes back and gets recycled.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:10:32):**  So, yeah, there's obviously different models being developed.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:10:36):**  At the end of the day, it's all about, you know, that gross margin that you can generate.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:10:40):**  That's a great example of that kind of business model flexibility.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:10:45):**  We'd love to see it go further.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:10:46):**  We'd like to see them actually go into the business of supplying new water.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:10:49):**  But I think that that's that's a really good example.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:10:52):**  Let's bring in Inge Biskoner now.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:10:54):**  Formerly with Toro Ag, Inge has a farming background and today is an irrigation consultant

**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:11:08):**  Inge argues that the key to getting more irrigation technology used on farms lies in education.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:11:14):**  We have all this wonderful technology and I often say there's a tsunami of technology  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:11:18):**  coming to agriculture and especially in irrigation, which is my area of expertise.

**[0:11:31-0:11:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:11:31):**  And the technology is lost.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:11:32):**  So we really need to help either, you know, educate or onboard our technology in a better  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:11:38):**  way to have it used to its maximum potential.

**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:11:48):**  probably the former flood irrigation system.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:11:50):**  And it may be the best irrigation system in the world, but if that farmer is not taught  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:11:57):**  how to determine when to schedule the irrigations according to the agronomic principles like  
**[0:12:02-0:12:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:12:02):**  ET, you know, how much water is the crop using and how much water is my system applying.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:12:09):**  If they aren't taught that, then the system itself, some people end up running their drip

**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:12:37):**  in charge on the farm to utilize the technology appropriately.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:12:42):**  But in my view, I think the role really belongs with a future irrigation consultant who specializes  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:12:48):**  in this and who the farm hires for this purpose because the irrigation dealers are great in  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:12:54):**  constructing systems and the manufacturers are great in innovation and inventing new  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:12:59):**  technologies, sprinklers, drip, pumps, valves, sprinklers, and so forth, but not necessarily  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:13:06):**  agronomic principles of how to use the system.

**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:13:15):**  As an agronomist, Shane can certainly relate to this gap in the industry around irrigation  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:13:19):**  skills and knowledge.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:13:21):**  When I started agronomy, which wasn't really that long ago, call it 10 years ago, we were  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:13:25):**  really using what we called the Dutch auger.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:13:27):**  So you put your probe in the ground, do the hand moisture test, and you're like, well,  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:13:31):**  you know, it's 80% to capacity and we need to put on an inch or whatever it might be  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:13:36):**  and do a circle.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:13:37):**  And right now where we've really just started to see things going in is to just start using  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:13:42):**  moisture probes in the ground to really better understand where they're at from a moisture  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:13:47):**  in the soil profile perspective, but then starting to actually couple that with an understanding  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:13:52):**  of what's actually going on with that crop.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:13:54):**  But there's still the challenges with that where I was talking with a friend just the  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:13:58):**  other day and he's like, I'm using all these soil moisture probes, but then I still can't  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:14:02):**  even perfectly align with the guy that is going to turn on the pivot at the right time.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:14:07):**  And then he's overrunning the sprayer over here.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:14:09):**  And so you still run into these, these same challenges, even with this incremental technology.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:14:14):**  And so that's where there needs to still be some of these other incentives in place.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:14:17):**  But there is actually the incentive, I guess, in general to get somebody in place to focus  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:14:22):**  specifically on that or invest in some other technology that's going to more seamlessly  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:14:26):**  automate that or alert you to it even from from that perspective.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:14:30):**  Ingy are nodding there.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:14:31):**  Does that resonate with you?  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:14:33):**  Yes, it does as far as the automation part and the technology.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:14:38):**  I've had people say that the only way we're going to succeed is if we make an irrigation  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:14:44):**  system similar to the thermostat in a person's home, where you just set it on the temperature  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:14:49):**  that you're comfortable with and the machine in the background or in the attic will do  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:14:53):**  what it needs to do to make that happen.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:14:56):**  And that really you need to take the human out of it to get this automation to work.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:15:00):**  And I, you know, in agriculture and growing crops, maybe someday, but not right now.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:15:04):**  I don't I think farmers are never going to let some artificial intelligence determine  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:15:11):**  when to make what is a crucial decision on a very expensive enterprise.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:15:17):**  And the farmer is the CEO of the farm, and they're juggling a lot of different stuff.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:15:20):**  You know, they've got the finance and the mechanics, the agronomics, and then this thing  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:15:24):**  called irrigation, for instance.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:15:26):**  And I foresee that we're just going to have specialized experts and hopefully some young  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:15:32):**  one to two year college degree program type folks.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:15:37):**  I don't think you need a four year degree or a Ph.D. or higher level education to do  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:15:41):**  some of the things that are needed to do on the farm these days.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:15:46):**  And I see some of the junior colleges stepping up and offering programs to help with that.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:15:52):**  And I see that as one of the critical things.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:15:55):**  Another major shift that Inge is starting to see is water not only as a major driver  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:16:00):**  for farming decisions, but also becoming the key unit of measurement on farm and in some  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:16:05):**  cases becoming even more valuable than the land.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:16:09):**  I was on the board of the California Irrigation Institute and our sole purpose was to host  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:16:16):**  a yearly conference.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:16:17):**  One of the farmers that I had recruited to speak at that conference one year really had  
**[0:16:23-0:16:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:16:23):**  a innovative approach to managing his large family's farm in central California.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:16:31):**  And it was evolving from the typical, hey, what is our yield per acre, but yield per  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:16:37):**  acre or yield per hectare, to a yield per unit of water.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:16:43):**  Because water was then becoming more valuable and more scarce.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:16:48):**  And they were making farm decisions on what they were going to grow and what they were  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:16:51):**  going to plant, what the enterprise was going to produce, based on which crop generated  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:16:57):**  the most return per acre foot of water.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:00):**  The water was more valuable than the land.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:02):**  And yes, that's happening, I think, over the whole world.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:06):**  In this part of the world, we haven't done the numbers for a while, but when we did,  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:10):**  and it was probably about six or seven years ago, we sort of worked out that the value  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:13):**  of the water in the Southern Murray-Darling Basin was worth about three times the value  
**[0:17:18-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:18):**  of the land that it irrigated.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:19):**  And I bet, given the appreciation in water that's occurred over the last five years,  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:24):**  that it would probably more like a multiple of five today.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:28):**  Land isn't the limiting factor here.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:30):**  Water is the limiting factor.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:31):**  And so being able to use it efficiently so that you can add value to it, that's what  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:37):**  the model is.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:38):**  The thing in Australia where you do have a functioning water market, you can see every  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:42):**  day exactly what the cost of the water is that you're using.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:46):**  So you do get increasingly rational behaviour from farmers who say, well, if it's $300 a  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:52):**  megalitre, and that's my expectation as to what it's going to be for the rest of the  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:17:56):**  season, I'm not going to grow a rice crop and turn $300 worth of water into $150 worth  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:18:01):**  of rice.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:18:02):**  And so it works.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:18:03):**  We see rice crops grow from 50,000t to probably 600,000, 650,000t this year because there's  
**[0:18:11-0:18:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:18:11):**  a lot more water around.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:18:13):**  And it'll shrink back to 50,000t again once water prices go up again.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:18:17):**  So you get real response to that.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:18:20):**  One of the things I'm really interested in going forward, and Inge touched on it, is  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:18:25):**  that these are really critical decisions that farmers are making about when they water and  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:18:29):**  how much they water.

**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:18:35):**  for a while, that sort of technology where you've got low cost monitoring feeding information

**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:19:02):**  And the farmer doesn't need more data.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:19:05):**  What they need is a recommendation based on maybe an algorithm or whatever, but they need

**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:19:27):**  Do you in the other countries also have what I call these silos?  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:19:31):**  You have your irrigation experts over here, and actually they're more engineering and

**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:19:44):**  and seeds and soil and maybe irrigation water, but not so much.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:19:50):**  And I see one of the major challenges is marrying these two fields of expertise and getting  
**[0:19:55-0:19:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:19:55):**  them together.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:19:57):**  And in my position at the Irrigation Association out of Washington, DC, I'm advocating for  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:20:01):**  that that we reach out to the agronomists because they need us and we need them to integrate  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:20:07):**  water with because really the water is the most important part of the agronomic puzzle.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:20:14):**  I have a very good friend who's one of the premier crop doctors here in California who

**[0:20:27-0:20:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:20:27):**  I've got yellow leaves, something's wrong.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:20:29):**  It's not bugs or disease or fertility.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:20:34):**  It's the water.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:20:35):**  It's poor irrigation management, over-watering, too wet, maybe soil and water interactions.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:20:41):**  So we need the agronomists and the irrigators to get together.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:20:44):**  So is that true in your countries as well?  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:20:49):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:20:50):**  It's a worldwide problem then.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:20:52):**  We might think so.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:20:53):**  Engineers are engineers, agronomists are agronomists.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:20:55):**  Trying to get them together, that's the job of the farmer.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:21:00):**  And we saw a really specific version of that and actually saw it as much in Australia and  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:21:04):**  the US where because, like I say, if you talk about a drip system, because the drip system  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:21:10):**  was designed by engineers, it's like laid out linear and the number of valves is the  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:21:15):**  minimum number required to deliver the water.

**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:21:22):**  soil type.

**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:21:26):**  If you want to, because the problem that I think a related problem is you get an insight  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:21:31):**  that you can't implement.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:21:34):**  Because it's like, well, actually we need to put a different amount of water down this  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:21:37):**  part of the field than that part of the field.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:21:40):**  And yet the design of the irrigation system simply doesn't allow it because of the placement  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:21:45):**  of the valves.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:21:46):**  Now, I think to translate, to get this back to stuff that's actionable to farmers, I think,  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:21:52):**  be more demanding of combining those skills upfront, right?  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:21:56):**  As much as possible, understand that you have to combine the agronomic and the technical  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:22:02):**  stuff really at the design stage.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:22:05):**  So don't spend new money unless you're sure how those co-benefits are going to coexist,  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:22:12):**  they're going to be delivered alongside each other, I think is a super important point.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:22:18):**  The point you made about the thermostat, Angie, really resonated because one of the things  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:22:22):**  we've been joking about in writing this report is that Silicon Valley ruined ag tech, which  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:22:27):**  I can probably say because I'm from there, I guess, and you only believe that.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:22:31):**  But this idea, you can imagine a tech company going to pitch an investor and being like,  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:22:35):**  just like our thermostat, we need to automate all of this and take the human out of it and  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:22:39):**  remove the emotion and just turn the temperature to what you want and abstract away from it.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:22:42):**  And anyone who's worked in agriculture knows exactly how wrong that answer actually is.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:22:48):**  But from an investor perspective, it's so compelling to be like, yeah, of course that  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:22:50):**  makes sense.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:22:51):**  Like tech can just do it and we'll have the technology make it work.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:22:54):**  But until you get out on the fields, you realize that's not really the approach.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:22:57):**  I'd be curious, maybe a quick answer from all of you on advice for farmers who are thinking  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:23:03):**  about irrigation technology.

**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:23:08):**  requirements are.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:23:10):**  Other tips that you'd have for farmers looking at what is a complex, evolving and crowded  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:23:14):**  irrigation tech space?  
**[0:23:16-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:23:16):**  And we'll start with you.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:23:19):**  I actually feel a lot of, we're all experts in our little fields and they have to absorb  
**[0:23:23-0:23:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:23:23):**  a lot very quickly.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:23:24):**  So the number one piece of advice I would give is to, yes, have that long conversation  
**[0:23:31-0:23:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:23:31):**  with your irrigation system technology provider at the onset of your project.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:23:38):**  And I think it's incumbent on the industry and I include the commodity groups as well  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:23:45):**  to help coach their growers on how to do that.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:23:48):**  I mean, it may be as simple as, hey, are you going to want to use your irrigation system  
**[0:23:53-0:23:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:23:53):**  for habitat management around your farm?  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:23:55):**  I mean, hedge grows or is it for climate control as well?  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:23:59):**  And the whole thing about the soils, are we going to need to valve the system separately  
**[0:24:03-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:03):**  for soils?

**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:07):**  and what's the timing on all this?  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:09):**  So it's very complex, which is precisely why a thermostat is not going to work, at least  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:14):**  not right now until AI gets a lot more intelligent.

**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:20):**  Well, I guess I'd just suggest you start with the soil.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:25):**  I mean, that's as much as it's about water, you're growing, eating is the most important  
**[0:24:29-0:24:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:29):**  thing after that.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:31):**  So making sure that you understand that well and you're thinking about the irrigation technology  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:35):**  that's most appropriate for the soils that you're operating in.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:38):**  I then say keeping it simple.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:41):**  We always just use one supplier generally.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:44):**  That means you can keep spares.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:45):**  Everybody understands the systems.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:47):**  It just makes it easier for people to then operate it.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:51):**  And I guess the third thing would be to say, keep good records.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:55):**  It's an iterative process.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:24:56):**  You need to actually be able to go back and understand what worked and why.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:01):**  And it's very difficult.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:02):**  None of us actually have that greater memory as it turns out.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:06):**  And so you actually need to be able to go back and understand what was the difference,  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:10):**  what did we do differently and what was the outcome.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:14):**  So that'd be probably my three takeaways.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:16):**  Awesome.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:17):**  Shane, any advice you'd provide from the report and the discussion today and your experience?  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:24):**  Water drives everything.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:25):**  That's your nitrogen use efficiency, your boron uptake, all these different things,  
**[0:25:30-0:25:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:30):**  mineralization, all that gets driven by moisture.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:32):**  So if you can start to understand how strong water applications and water management can  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:37):**  actually help to manage your nitrogen applications and your output from that, I think that goes  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:42):**  so far.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:43):**  And it just comes down to measuring it, recording it, and then actually thinking about it and  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:48):**  looking at it and doing a check, whether it's on a weekly basis or on the end of the year  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:52):**  basis just to really see how did you do and how did it compare on a per crop basis or  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:25:58):**  even to different varieties, which doesn't always get talked about.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:26:01):**  The agronomist in me that starts to look at those sorts of things.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:26:03):**  So I think, yeah, it just comes back to really focusing in on that measurement because from  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:26:07):**  there the old adage, if you don't measure it, you can't manage it or something along  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:26:11):**  those lines.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:26:12):**  That's so true.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:26:13):**  And just something that's so key as we talk about technology and everything progressing,  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:26:17):**  because obviously technology often allows us to measure more.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:26:21):**  But if we're not actually doing anything incremental with that, yeah, it can be challenging.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:26:27):**  Matthew? I think in our how Silicon Valley destroyed AgTech theme, I think that what  
**[0:26:33-0:26:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:26:33):**  we're trying to say there is that the technology often has a first order impact.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:26:40):**  Like the person who uses it is the person who sees the benefit.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:26:43):**  And a lot of Silicon Valley style innovation is delivered that way.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:26:47):**  I think a lot of the insight that was missing in a lot of first and even second generation  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:26:51):**  AgTech is that it's the supply chain impact that you have.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:26:55):**  You've got to look at the total supply chain impact because often the money is somewhere  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:26:59):**  else.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:27:00):**  So I think that would be the advice.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:27:03):**  If you're looking at practice change, to Euan's point, if it's about soil or if it's about  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:27:10):**  exactly where water can be saved, look at who else in the supply chain is really going  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:27:15):**  to back you in that change.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:27:18):**  So if it's about lower input of water and lower input of nitrogen, it's going to be  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:27:24):**  less runoff, it's going to be better protected waterways.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:27:27):**  And so you've probably got really strong allies in the natural capital space or your downstream  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:27:33):**  suppliers who might have a really strong water stewardship program.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:27:37):**  So it's not just within the confines of my property, how much water could I save or how  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:27:43):**  much time could I save?  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:27:45):**  Just that idea that we could manifest this water as tomatoes, or we could sell it to  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:27:51):**  the people who can't do without it at the times, that level of flexibility, that kind  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:27:56):**  of lateral thinking along the supply chain, I think is really where you have to focus  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:28:01):**  first.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:28:02):**  And then when you've understood that, your on-farm investment decisions, I think are  
**[0:28:05-0:28:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:28:05):**  going to be much better directed.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:28:08):**  So we've heard about some of the state of the tech and problems today, but what can  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:28:12):**  we expect for the future of irrigation technology?  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:28:15):**  Instead of more tech, we believe that what will actually accelerate the adoption is an  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:28:19):**  evolution in how the technology is being positioned and brought to market.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:28:23):**  I asked the group for their final thoughts.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:28:25):**  Here's Matthew.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:28:27):**  I think the things to look out for are consolidation and using that consolidation to broader the  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:28:34):**  view on business model.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:28:37):**  So we've observed that there's been a couple of generations of investment in irrigation  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:28:42):**  ag tech and there's been an awful lot of money and nowhere nearly as much returned.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:28:47):**  And we can already see examples of acquisitions, of consolidations.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:28:52):**  And when you can kind of get that stacked functionality, then I think you can expand  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:28:57):**  the reach from clearly differentiating the user from the customer, the kind of beneficiary  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:29:03):**  from the economic, the sort of functional beneficiary from the economic beneficiary.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:29:07):**  So I think that's really where we're going to be super interested to see the market play  
**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:29:12):**  out.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:29:13):**  Thanks.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:29:14):**  Shane?  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:29:15):**  I think the most interesting part, I guess, for me that I'll be watching is just that  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:29:19):**  we hear a lot about all the carbon space and there's a lot of focus on the ESG and just  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:29:23):**  really how well some of this play out across the globe when it comes to how water plays  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:29:28):**  into that, how we talk about carbon credits, how will water be associated with that and  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:29:33):**  how will that be driven.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:29:34):**  And I think as we see some of the feasibility of some of these technologies come to fruition,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:29:38):**  I guess, just around better understanding of what's going on in the soil, as Ian alluded  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:29:43):**  to the cost coming down, in theory, as we get to better call it capability to deliver

**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:29:53):**  benefit will be.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:29:54):**  There's been a seismic shift over the last, well, even the last 18 months.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:29:59):**  It's been sort of gathering, but in the last 12 months, it's almost the first base question  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:05):**  in relation to people's consideration of investment in this space.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:09):**  They want to be part of the solution and not the problem.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:12):**  And I think if you look at agricultural emissions globally, it's around about 14 per cent in  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:17):**  total.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:18):**  But it is one of the few places that can actually play a really positive role because everything  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:23):**  else is avoided emissions.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:24):**  What we can do in Ag is actually take out some of that bank carbon and being able to  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:29):**  play that role and having investors understand that this is, or they're demanding that if  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:34):**  they put their money to work in this space, that it is actually part of the solution.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:39):**  I think that's going to be a really important driving force going forward.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:43):**  Awesome.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:44):**  Thanks, Ian.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:45):**  Couldn't agree more.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:46):**  Inge.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:47):**  I think that just as the organic movement was a pipe dream and just a fringe thought  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:55):**  40 years ago, and now, of course, it's mainstream.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:30:59):**  I think that the consumer will always drive how our food is grown.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:31:05):**  And I think the consumer today very much cares about where their food comes from and what  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:31:11):**  it's taken to grow it.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:31:14):**  And it's odd because at no time in history has the consumer been so disconnected from  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:31:19):**  their food and how it's grown and where it comes from.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:31:21):**  So they're not on the farm, but they're very interested in how it's grown.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:31:26):**  And I think that's going to drive agriculture to adopt appropriate technology to be resource  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:31:33):**  efficient and appropriately grown.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:31:38):**  And we'll see similar types of certifications for food that we see in building like LEED  
**[0:31:43-0:31:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:31:43):**  certification building where we have stewardship types of certifications for our food.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:31:50):**  And I also think we'll see disruption in what is grown where.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:31:56):**  For instance, where resources are scarce and expensive and have unique climates such as  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:32:03):**  California, it makes no sense to grow lower value crops.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:32:08):**  They will move elsewhere in favor of higher value crops where we are.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:32:12):**  And actually, many acres may go out of production just because of the lack of available water.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:32:17):**  So there's going to be some disruptions.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/24/the-agtech-adoption-dilemma-irrigation#t=0:32:21):**  And that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.

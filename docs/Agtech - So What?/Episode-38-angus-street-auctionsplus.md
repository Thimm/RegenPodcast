### Agtech - So What?  (Tue, 26 Mar 2019 12:02:49)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome back to the AgTechSoWhat podcast. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet, and founder  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:00:11):**  of AgTentik, where we work to bridge the gaps between agriculture and technology. This week,  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:00:16):**  we have something new for you or something that we've tried in the past and wanted to  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:00:20):**  bring back, which is a live recording from the Sydney AgTech Meetup. The Sydney AgTech  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:00:25):**  Meetup is something we do about every six to eight weeks, thanks to our sponsor, SproutX.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:00:29):**  This week's guest was Angus Street, CEO of AuctionsPlus, an online livestock sale yard.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:00:35):**  Angus took the reins of AuctionsPlus about the middle of last year and shares his story of what  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:00:42):**  that was like and where AuctionsPlus and companies like AuctionsPlus with a strong online digital  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:00:48):**  presence are looking to do in the future. The episode is short and sweet. I don't record here  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:00:54):**  any of the intro of the meetup and I don't record the Q&A because both are a bit hard to hear,  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:00:59):**  but Angus and I still cover a good amount of ground and I hope you enjoy it. Here's Angus.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:01:04):**  So Angus Street, CEO of AuctionsPlus. I have had a bit of an eclectic background. I started as a  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:01:20):**  journalist. Well, actually, prior to that, I actually got kicked out of Ag Science at Sydney University.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:01:24):**  So I did two years there and failed. Can we just stop there? Why did you get kicked out? Multiple reasons.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:01:32):**  But obviously science and I loved agriculture. I wanted to, I finished school and I wanted to be in  
**[0:01:41-0:01:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:01:41):**  the Ag sector and I wasn't overly, I guess, academic during my secondary years and Ag Science  
**[0:01:50-0:01:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:01:50):**  was the natural path for me into Sydney University. I probably jumped into it thinking, oh yeah, this  
**[0:01:58-0:02:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:01:58):**  will be all Ag production, you know, a bit of technology. There's nothing like it. And so I think the  
**[0:02:05-0:02:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:02:05):**  first two years were Chemistry 1001, you know, Biology 1002 and me and science just like this.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:02:13):**  So I moved on to bigger and better things and did a business degree, went, was a journalist for a  
**[0:02:22-0:02:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:02:22):**  couple of years, then started working for MLA for about three years and from MLA, I followed my heart  
**[0:02:32-0:02:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:02:32):**  and my love, who's now my wife, down to Melbourne and I got a job in a in an Ag marketing agency  
**[0:02:43-0:02:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:02:43):**  called Red Handed at the time and so I worked with Jim Gaul down there for about 12 to 18 months. From  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:02:51):**  there, I kind of, I wanted to try the agency space and I had kind of done that and I wasn't having  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:02:57):**  the impact that I genuinely wanted to have and an opportunity came up at Horticulture Innovation  
**[0:03:04-0:03:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:03:04):**  Australia, which was looking after their vegetable portfolio, which was their largest R&D portfolio  
**[0:03:11-0:03:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:03:11):**  out of all of the port sectors. From there, there was an opportunity that they opened up, kind of  
**[0:03:21-0:03:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:03:21):**  like the MDC for Horticulture, that the MDC is the donor company, they had a donor company equivalent  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:03:28):**  at HAA and I was one of the founding or one of the beginning start fund managers and I looked after  
**[0:03:35-0:03:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:03:35):**  an Asian markets fund and my job was effectively to go and procure or source foreign investment in  
**[0:03:45-0:03:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:03:45):**  particular across Asia back into Australia and to open up those channels of supply and demand.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:03:53):**  During that time, I spent 12 months in China, living in China and then I came back and I met  
**[0:04:03-0:04:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:04:03):**  Sarah about that same time and I'd actually had a crack at my first business and that was an  
**[0:04:11-0:04:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:04:11):**  e-commerce platform that connected Australian health food businesses directly to Chinese  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:04:19):**  consumers. So it was a cross-border e-commerce platform effectively and I'm happy to say that  
**[0:04:25-0:04:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:04:25):**  it didn't go as planned but we exited about a month ago. So it was good, not for what I wanted,  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:04:34):**  but we exited and then obviously ended up at options class. Yeah, cool. So just for those who  
**[0:04:40-0:04:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:04:40):**  don't know, how many of you would say you know what Auctions Plus is and how it works? So give  
**[0:04:47-0:04:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:04:47):**  us the Auctions Plus 101. Yeah, if I met somebody on the tube or on the train, it'd be like eBay  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:04:54):**  for cattle and sheep. So walk us through a typical use case if you're a farmer, you do what on  
**[0:05:00-0:05:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:05:00):**  Auctions Plus? Yeah, so if you're a farmer, you've got the option to sell through the sale yards  
**[0:05:07-0:05:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:05:07):**  direct to a processor or feed ladder or you've got the option now to sell online and those stock  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:05:16):**  are assessed by 900 accredited assessors, effectively valuers, similar to property valuers,  
**[0:05:23-0:05:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:05:23):**  that go out and value the livestock. They collect a range of data, probably about 150 data points on  
**[0:05:31-0:05:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:05:31):**  individual animals. That data is uploaded onto our system and those lots are purchased by buyer  
**[0:05:40-0:05:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:05:40):**  anywhere in Australia, sight unseen. So the average transaction is like anywhere between 150 and 250  
**[0:05:48-0:05:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:05:48):**  thousand dollars, each click of the button. So people are selling a thousand sheep, you know,  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:05:56):**  thousand bucks a pop or 800 bucks a pop. So the big transactions, sight unseen. Yeah, it's pretty  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:06:02):**  cool and a big kind of transformation in the industry. Like there's still a number of things  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:06:07):**  in Ag that aren't let alone sold online, you know, it's sold in person and you got to kick the tires  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:06:12):**  and you got to go see it. So I know you weren't involved in the company when it started but how,  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:06:16):**  like talk a little bit about the shift for farmers and from an Auctions Plus strategy  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:06:20):**  perspective and getting farmers to transact online. Like how did that kind of go? Like the history or  
**[0:06:27-0:06:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:06:27):**  the last five years? Last five years. Okay, cool. So the business has gone through a number of  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:06:36):**  transitions but predominantly in the last five years, what we call internally is very much been,  
**[0:06:41-0:06:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:06:41):**  and probably the market does, its startup phase. So exponential growth in a particular in the  
**[0:06:50-0:06:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:06:50):**  store cattle and sheep market and to be honest with you that the tipping point for people to  
**[0:06:59-0:07:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:06:59):**  trial it was there was a good season and the value proposition met the market conditions at that  
**[0:07:10-0:07:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:07:10):**  point in time and that value proposition was really driven around not necessarily productivity  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:07:17):**  but profitability. If you see in the marketplace there's a bit of a shift from people now really  
**[0:07:22-0:07:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:07:22):**  analyzing their margins and obviously the online solution is a cheaper way to sell but also gives  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:07:30):**  you that maximum exposure to potentially capture that maximum value. So therefore your margin is  
**[0:07:36-0:07:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:07:36):**  more likely to get. One of the things that startups in all markets but especially in Ag struggle with  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:07:43):**  is in marketplaces is which side do I start with? Like do I get the buyers on first or do I get the  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:07:47):**  sellers on first? Now you have both which is great but how did you start? Which one did you think  
**[0:07:51-0:07:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:07:51):**  about getting and you may or may not have been involved in this decision? Yeah. But which one  
**[0:07:54-0:08:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:07:54):**  did you kind of? It's a very, it's an easy one. It's a chicken egg I guess problem for us. It's  
**[0:08:05-0:08:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:08:05):**  about supply side and the reason that we have to create value on the supply side it's because the  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:08:14):**  supply side is the side that we're charging the transaction fee. So we have to maximize value for  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:08:20):**  the transaction fee side and show them which in some instances oh well you've got to have a volume  
**[0:08:27-0:08:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:08:27):**  of buyers but with the volume of supply buyers will come. So we focused heavily on on supply  
**[0:08:37-0:08:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:08:37):**  side for about three years and then I would say the last two has definitely been a shift back to  
**[0:08:44-0:08:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:08:44):**  the buy side and and ensuring that we are vetting we're getting I guess active buyers the right  
**[0:08:52-0:08:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:08:52):**  buyers volume buyers not just any old job load. Yeah can you talk a little bit about your kind  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:08:59):**  of target customer and we were actually just chatting about this before the kind of early  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:09:04):**  adopters in AG and in other industries and then like a kind of chasm and the middle majority and  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:09:09):**  so are you guys would you say you're still in a kind of early adopter phase even though you've  
**[0:09:13-0:09:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:09:13):**  been around 30 years now or are you have you kind of well moved into that middle majority and like  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:09:20):**  what's the kind of journey like there? Yeah it's a really good question and I think we're right in  
**[0:09:24-0:09:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:09:24):**  that transition. So in the chasm there? Not at the bottom. We're about to we're leaping over as we  
**[0:09:32-0:09:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:09:32):**  speak. I think in the in our I guess the store stock store catalog store livestock category we  
**[0:09:41-0:09:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:09:41):**  you know we've penetrated that category you know and we're doing you know I wouldn't say we've  
**[0:09:49-0:09:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:09:49):**  we've hit complete market share there but but we're doing I guess some fantastic stuff. What  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:09:58):**  the opportunity now for us is to penetrate into other livestock sector sorry into other categories  
**[0:10:04-0:10:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:10:04):**  within the livestock sector and so. What would an example of that be? So prime stock so fat  
**[0:10:11-0:10:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:10:11):**  lambs it would be your odds and ends it would be stud stock it could be dairy could be feeder  
**[0:10:19-0:10:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:10:19):**  cattle and so we've busted up you know that the commercial livestock sector is made up a bunch of  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:10:26):**  different categories we're very strong in a couple of them but for us back to your question target  
**[0:10:32-0:10:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:10:32):**  customer everybody would assume and I get asked a lot well it's it's age generation is driving the  
**[0:10:41-0:10:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:10:41):**  uptake of of Oxen's Plus when in actual fact our average user it's actually doing the age of 45  
**[0:10:48-0:10:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:10:48):**  and 50 on the website so I wouldn't say that it's the younger generation or the coming back to the  
**[0:10:57-0:11:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:10:57):**  farm what it is is the farmers right now or probably the last five years has been those  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:11:04):**  those farmers who are looking to do something different are looking to differentiate and to  
**[0:11:09-0:11:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:11:09):**  looking to get to capture maximum value out of whatever they're selling and so we look at it a  
**[0:11:18-0:11:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:11:18):**  farmer has invested toiled energy money blood sweat and tears into growing this produce or  
**[0:11:27-0:11:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:11:27):**  this item to throw it onto the open market with absolutely no control and get slammed by market  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:11:37):**  forces that are out of their control is really heart-wrenching and so it's really about how do  
**[0:11:43-0:11:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:11:43):**  we shift the dial from sellers being price takers to price makers and that's obviously more than  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:11:53):**  just a role for a marketplace right like there's so much there that would require that shift to  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:11:58):**  happen and it's one of things I wanted to kind of focus on and I imagine people have questions on is  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:12:02):**  you know you guys have been around a long time you've gotten a bit of scale momentum you know  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:12:05):**  some good numbers and track record on the board elders behind you what do you see as your kind of  
**[0:12:10-0:12:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:12:10):**  role or ability to work with other startup ag tech players and and whether it's to help add value to  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:12:17):**  the growers or otherwise in the marketplace how do you going to see that strategy evolving yeah I'm  
**[0:12:21-0:12:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:12:21):**  a big believer of you know the power of many and I think auctions plus five years ago when our my  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:12:31):**  former CEO Anna Speer was in the role it was just about getting momentum and it was just about  
**[0:12:37-0:12:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:12:37):**  rolling that train forward and and and polishing it up so that it was there was a it started to  
**[0:12:45-0:12:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:12:45):**  just travel so now that the train is moving and moving quite quickly it's about how can we bring  
**[0:12:54-0:13:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:12:54):**  farmers other ag tech businesses industry government non-for-profits services tools  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:13:04):**  information knowledge along for the ride and so definitely the future of auctions plus is not just  
**[0:13:12-0:13:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:13:12):**  at that transaction it is the ecosystem of tools and services that surround that that transaction  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:13:20):**  and what's your vision or I guess at the next level of detail down for your role do you see  
**[0:13:25-0:13:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:13:25):**  it as like a technical like you'll create the technical infrastructure to enable that is it  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:13:28):**  the the kind of top of the funnel marketing like you have farmer eyeballs and you can talk more  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:13:33):**  about this stuff is it like another kind of intervention how do you actually see you guys  
**[0:13:37-0:13:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:13:37):**  enabling that vision yeah it's a really good point I think on a technical side I wouldn't say that we  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:13:46):**  are going to necessarily be the enablers of that because we have a core business which is a market  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:13:52):**  place as a transactional platform and so there are experts out there that are building AG tech  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:13:58):**  innovations that are specialists in their fields and have a I guess a dedicated vision for their  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:14:05):**  business what I see our role is a channel to market for those ag tech companies and a way to  
**[0:14:11-0:14:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:14:11):**  I guess leverage the success of auctions plus of the eyeballs traffic the website traffic our  
**[0:14:20-0:14:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:14:20):**  connections so we're owned by Elders Landmark and Rulco and and it's you know as agents these are  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:14:27):**  the these are the men and women who are driving up the driveways every day of the week so as a  
**[0:14:32-0:14:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:14:32):**  distribution channel for technology it's kind of for us it's it's a no-brainer so yeah are you  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:14:41):**  getting so I mean in working with the startup space there's a real push to get into different  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:14:47):**  channels right and to work with these different players and the kind of common strategy is let's  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:14:51):**  go in through the Innovation Department or kind of going through the front door have you gotten  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:14:55):**  startups coming to you and saying let's go in through auctions plus to get distribution and  
**[0:14:59-0:15:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:14:59):**  yeah definitely 100% I mean I think the Fairfax newspapers did some analysis of the top 10  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:15:09):**  websites that are visited in by rural and regional people in New South Wales and Queensland apart  
**[0:15:15-0:15:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:15:15):**  from the Bureau of Meteorology elders weather and the weather zone app and the news sites we're the  
**[0:15:23-0:15:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:15:23):**  only other website in that top 10 and we actually sit fifth and seventh in terms of website visits  
**[0:15:29-0:15:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:15:29):**  so which is so for us where and I think when I got the role as CEO it was a you you feel so  
**[0:15:39-0:15:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:15:39):**  fortunate to be in this I feel so fortunate to be in this position because the organization is  
**[0:15:46-0:15:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:15:46):**  looked at by a huge array of customers of other businesses of government of industry so to be  
**[0:15:56-0:16:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:15:56):**  able to play a role to enable and be that channel so they can leverage us and selfishly and  
**[0:16:04-0:16:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:16:04):**  commercially we grow them it also grows us so yeah it's the you know it's that that ecosystem  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:16:13):**  model that a number of marketplaces are looking for a dog yeah one of the interesting challenges  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:16:20):**  for startups and working with bigger companies is the kind of cultural fit and that you're gonna  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:16:24):**  get like death by the slow maybe and you're never gonna kind of get in the door and you know it's  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:16:28):**  really hard to kind of have that cultural fit to really get things done do you and you mentioned  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:16:33):**  kind of startup culture before so tell me a little bit about the culture at auctions plus and do you  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:16:37):**  see that as like a way that you could work with startups kind of more easily or more quickly than  
**[0:16:42-0:16:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:16:42):**  some of the big companies yeah definitely we're a super young teamer and what this is obviously you  
**[0:16:49-0:16:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:16:49):**  know there's some pain points that come with that but overarching Lee what comes with it is just an  
**[0:16:56-0:17:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:16:56):**  enthusiasm a passion and an absolute dedication from that generation of individuals and you  
**[0:17:07-0:17:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:17:07):**  harness that and magical things can happen and like we've seen it and it's something that Anna  
**[0:17:16-0:17:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:17:16):**  spear former CEO has kind of has looked at and has kind of driven or kicked off and I'm just kind of  
**[0:17:24-0:17:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:17:24):**  now the custodian of that and saying well yes we might have gone past our startup phase and we've  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:17:34):**  got a report a little bit more and get a little bit more structure but no way in hell are we going  
**[0:17:40-0:17:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:17:40):**  to be corporate eyes no we're still going to give ourselves a flexibility in our strategy to pivot  
**[0:17:47-0:17:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:17:47):**  to be opportunistic to have big bold ideas to chase the dream to run up rivers that you know  
**[0:17:56-0:18:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:17:56):**  that are dead ends and one of the big things that we kind of talk about internally is and talked  
**[0:18:04-0:18:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:18:04):**  about globally but is you know fear of failure I talk about pie on your face and I encourage all  
**[0:18:11-0:18:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:18:11):**  the guys it's okay to get pie on your face how our business our performance plans are actually  
**[0:18:20-0:18:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:18:20):**  structured is not necessarily KPIs it is around intent so the positive intent and the desire that  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:18:32):**  like the unwavering desire to achieve something so if you're moving forward and you've got that  
**[0:18:38-0:18:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:18:38):**  intent to achieve the desired outcome that is what from a very detailed performance do you would you  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:18:46):**  say your team is young like that's really young enough is it because the tech talent that you  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:18:51):**  have been able to find is that age or is it that like that's the kind of culture you've created or  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:18:56):**  like I guess it's even some of the other ag tech startups that we've probably all seen and worked  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:19:01):**  with I would say haven't been that young and have much smaller teams than you do so and I'm curious  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:19:05):**  about sort of why and also does that cause any kind of issues given that some of the average age  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:19:11):**  of the farmers they'd be working with are quite a bit older just from a customer empathy understanding  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:19:16):**  perspective are there any kind of challenges there yeah it's a good question and it probably  
**[0:19:20-0:19:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:19:20):**  we get away with it because obviously I bust the team up into a bus the business up into two kind  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:19:28):**  of times you've got our developers which are completely diverse bunch of men and women very  
**[0:19:34-0:19:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:19:34):**  much multicultural and we've got Ken who leads it and he's been with the business for 22 years and  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:19:43):**  so he knows the system inside and out he's rebuilt it three times and he's about to rebuild it again  
**[0:19:48-0:19:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:19:48):**  so he's in our tech team and then you've just got a huge array of I guess developers that are yes  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:19:58):**  a little bit older but you know I wouldn't say like they would be the older generation in the  
**[0:20:04-0:20:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:20:04):**  team then you come to our sales and our our farmer and assessor success teams our operations teams  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:20:12):**  and these are the guys that are on the front line that are on the phones day in day out and we we  
**[0:20:19-0:20:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:20:19):**  have probably a third of them don't have an ag background but they have a passion for agriculture  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:20:27):**  they studied ag science and past well they studied ag echoes and and past it's tough to do it here  
**[0:20:34-0:20:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:20:34):**  yeah yeah and and so they they've just got that innate passion for the ag sector and then the rest  
**[0:20:43-0:20:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:20:43):**  are younger guys and girls who have come off a farm and so they have that ability to just have  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:20:50):**  a conversation like having a conversation to their dad or their grandfather and or then their neighbor  
**[0:20:55-0:21:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:20:55):**  effectively and the ag sector is tiny and you really get to know when you're speaking to these  
**[0:21:04-0:21:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:21:04):**  when these these graduates and you know first and second year kind of guys in the business  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:21:13):**  they're like oh g'day Bob it's it's Anna Holcomb here or it's you know it's Angus Street here and  
**[0:21:18-0:21:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:21:18):**  they go oh you know my second and third cousin and it's just like everybody knows everybody  
**[0:21:25-0:21:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:21:25):**  six degrees of separation so it's very important that we have that those guys have that empathy  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:21:33):**  and that understanding and in actual fact sometimes they can be too empathetic and it  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:21:39):**  and it holds back innovation and change what do you mean by that like what's an example oh it's  
**[0:21:45-0:21:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:21:45):**  you know a lot of the guys families are struggling with drought a couple of guys have obviously  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:21:52):**  one of the guys in particular has been impacted by the floods and so they've got family who are  
**[0:21:57-0:22:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:21:57):**  still on the ground and are feeling the impacts of ag life day in day out and so when we're saying  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:22:05):**  let's be bold let's be brave let's come up with this innovation they're kind of going  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:22:10):**  pump the brakes yeah pump the brakes and so it creates a what I like to call a healthy friction  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:22:15):**  you know because it's like well it's about putting it in front of them and then coaching and  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:22:20):**  empowering and and and and educating them and holding their hand all the way through yeah  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:22:25):**  interesting one probably area that we haven't touched on that I want to and then I'll open up  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:22:30):**  to the audience is given that you are owned by a bunch of companies that are agents and yet there's  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:22:37):**  I think I told you this like I get a call a month with the startup saying like we're out to disrupt  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:22:41):**  the livestock agents and we want to take back that five percent and help producers and like we need  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:22:45):**  something some marketplace or or disruption there do you like what do you see the role of auctions  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:22:51):**  plus being in that space given who owns you and given your ambition to work with startups and  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:22:55):**  enable startups and add value to growers like what's the plan yeah I'll I'll lift up a level  
**[0:23:01-0:23:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:23:01):**  and then dive into that and I think it really does come from our our owners and the board directors  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:23:09):**  that sit on the board directors on the board they're not the shareholders and so they are the  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:23:15):**  shareholders but when they step into a boardroom and give a strategic direction they're wearing  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:23:19):**  their director's hat and so which is fantastic so I have a conversation with these guys once a  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:23:24):**  quarter you know what is the model to to evolve what is the model to disrupt and from their  
**[0:23:30-0:23:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:23:30):**  and from their perspective how how I said and they obviously have been openly said it but they know  
**[0:23:39-0:23:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:23:39):**  that the agency model is going to evolve and so that evolution might be from one extreme completely  
**[0:23:48-0:23:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:23:48):**  cut out to being more of a consultant through to a broker the financial or the pricing structure for  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:23:58):**  all those services might change there is a evolution that is going to occur in livestock  
**[0:24:05-0:24:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:24:05):**  agency traditional stock and station agent agency game they can either be corporates be a part  
**[0:24:13-0:24:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:24:13):**  of the cannibalization or you know or wait for somebody to pop up and cannibalize them and so  
**[0:24:21-0:24:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:24:21):**  the business and hand on heart and I say this to all of the when I'm at an agency forum  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:24:30):**  so is that if I put to the board here is the business case the proof the analysis the technology

### Agtech - So What?  (2019-03-26)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome back to the AgTechSoWhat podcast. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet, and founder  of AgTentik, where we work to bridge the gaps between agriculture and technology. This week,  we have something new for you or something that we've tried in the past and wanted to  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:00:20):**  bring back, which is a live recording from the Sydney AgTech Meetup. The Sydney AgTech  Meetup is something we do about every six to eight weeks, thanks to our sponsor, SproutX.  This week's guest was Angus Street, CEO of AuctionsPlus, an online livestock sale yard.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:00:35):**  Angus took the reins of AuctionsPlus about the middle of last year and shares his story of what  that was like and where AuctionsPlus and companies like AuctionsPlus with a strong online digital  presence are looking to do in the future. The episode is short and sweet. I don't record here  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:00:54):**  any of the intro of the meetup and I don't record the Q&A because both are a bit hard to hear,  but Angus and I still cover a good amount of ground and I hope you enjoy it. Here's Angus.  So Angus Street, CEO of AuctionsPlus. I have had a bit of an eclectic background. I started as a  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:01:20):**  journalist. Well, actually, prior to that, I actually got kicked out of Ag Science at Sydney University.  So I did two years there and failed. Can we just stop there? Why did you get kicked out? Multiple reasons.  But obviously science and I loved agriculture. I wanted to, I finished school and I wanted to be in  
**[0:01:41-0:01:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:01:41):**  the Ag sector and I wasn't overly, I guess, academic during my secondary years and Ag Science  was the natural path for me into Sydney University. I probably jumped into it thinking, oh yeah, this  will be all Ag production, you know, a bit of technology. There's nothing like it. And so I think the  
**[0:02:05-0:02:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:02:05):**  first two years were Chemistry 1001, you know, Biology 1002 and me and science just like this.  So I moved on to bigger and better things and did a business degree, went, was a journalist for a  couple of years, then started working for MLA for about three years and from MLA, I followed my heart  
**[0:02:32-0:02:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:02:32):**  and my love, who's now my wife, down to Melbourne and I got a job in a in an Ag marketing agency  called Red Handed at the time and so I worked with Jim Gaul down there for about 12 to 18 months. From  there, I kind of, I wanted to try the agency space and I had kind of done that and I wasn't having  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:02:57):**  the impact that I genuinely wanted to have and an opportunity came up at Horticulture Innovation  Australia, which was looking after their vegetable portfolio, which was their largest R&D portfolio  out of all of the port sectors. From there, there was an opportunity that they opened up, kind of  
**[0:03:21-0:03:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:03:21):**  like the MDC for Horticulture, that the MDC is the donor company, they had a donor company equivalent  at HAA and I was one of the founding or one of the beginning start fund managers and I looked after  an Asian markets fund and my job was effectively to go and procure or source foreign investment in  
**[0:03:45-0:03:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:03:45):**  particular across Asia back into Australia and to open up those channels of supply and demand.  During that time, I spent 12 months in China, living in China and then I came back and I met  Sarah about that same time and I'd actually had a crack at my first business and that was an  
**[0:04:11-0:04:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:04:11):**  e-commerce platform that connected Australian health food businesses directly to Chinese  consumers. So it was a cross-border e-commerce platform effectively and I'm happy to say that  it didn't go as planned but we exited about a month ago. So it was good, not for what I wanted,  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:04:34):**  but we exited and then obviously ended up at options class. Yeah, cool. So just for those who  don't know, how many of you would say you know what Auctions Plus is and how it works? So give  us the Auctions Plus 101. Yeah, if I met somebody on the tube or on the train, it'd be like eBay  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:04:54):**  for cattle and sheep. So walk us through a typical use case if you're a farmer, you do what on  Auctions Plus? Yeah, so if you're a farmer, you've got the option to sell through the sale yards  direct to a processor or feed ladder or you've got the option now to sell online and those stock  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:05:16):**  are assessed by 900 accredited assessors, effectively valuers, similar to property valuers,  that go out and value the livestock. They collect a range of data, probably about 150 data points on  individual animals. That data is uploaded onto our system and those lots are purchased by buyer  
**[0:05:40-0:05:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:05:40):**  anywhere in Australia, sight unseen. So the average transaction is like anywhere between 150 and 250  thousand dollars, each click of the button. So people are selling a thousand sheep, you know,  thousand bucks a pop or 800 bucks a pop. So the big transactions, sight unseen. Yeah, it's pretty  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:06:02):**  cool and a big kind of transformation in the industry. Like there's still a number of things  in Ag that aren't let alone sold online, you know, it's sold in person and you got to kick the tires  and you got to go see it. So I know you weren't involved in the company when it started but how,  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:06:16):**  like talk a little bit about the shift for farmers and from an Auctions Plus strategy  perspective and getting farmers to transact online. Like how did that kind of go? Like the history or  the last five years? Last five years. Okay, cool. So the business has gone through a number of  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:06:36):**  transitions but predominantly in the last five years, what we call internally is very much been,  and probably the market does, its startup phase. So exponential growth in a particular in the  store cattle and sheep market and to be honest with you that the tipping point for people to  
**[0:06:59-0:07:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:06:59):**  trial it was there was a good season and the value proposition met the market conditions at that  point in time and that value proposition was really driven around not necessarily productivity  but profitability. If you see in the marketplace there's a bit of a shift from people now really  
**[0:07:22-0:07:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:07:22):**  analyzing their margins and obviously the online solution is a cheaper way to sell but also gives  you that maximum exposure to potentially capture that maximum value. So therefore your margin is  more likely to get. One of the things that startups in all markets but especially in Ag struggle with  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:07:43):**  is in marketplaces is which side do I start with? Like do I get the buyers on first or do I get the  sellers on first? Now you have both which is great but how did you start? Which one did you think  about getting and you may or may not have been involved in this decision? Yeah. But which one  
**[0:07:54-0:08:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:07:54):**  did you kind of? It's a very, it's an easy one. It's a chicken egg I guess problem for us. It's  about supply side and the reason that we have to create value on the supply side it's because the  supply side is the side that we're charging the transaction fee. So we have to maximize value for  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:08:20):**  the transaction fee side and show them which in some instances oh well you've got to have a volume  of buyers but with the volume of supply buyers will come. So we focused heavily on on supply  side for about three years and then I would say the last two has definitely been a shift back to  
**[0:08:44-0:08:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:08:44):**  the buy side and and ensuring that we are vetting we're getting I guess active buyers the right  buyers volume buyers not just any old job load. Yeah can you talk a little bit about your kind  of target customer and we were actually just chatting about this before the kind of early  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:09:04):**  adopters in AG and in other industries and then like a kind of chasm and the middle majority and  so are you guys would you say you're still in a kind of early adopter phase even though you've  been around 30 years now or are you have you kind of well moved into that middle majority and like  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:09:20):**  what's the kind of journey like there? Yeah it's a really good question and I think we're right in  that transition. So in the chasm there? Not at the bottom. We're about to we're leaping over as we  speak. I think in the in our I guess the store stock store catalog store livestock category we  
**[0:09:41-0:09:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:09:41):**  you know we've penetrated that category you know and we're doing you know I wouldn't say we've  we've hit complete market share there but but we're doing I guess some fantastic stuff. What  the opportunity now for us is to penetrate into other livestock sector sorry into other categories  
**[0:10:04-0:10:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:10:04):**  within the livestock sector and so. What would an example of that be? So prime stock so fat  lambs it would be your odds and ends it would be stud stock it could be dairy could be feeder  cattle and so we've busted up you know that the commercial livestock sector is made up a bunch of  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:10:26):**  different categories we're very strong in a couple of them but for us back to your question target  customer everybody would assume and I get asked a lot well it's it's age generation is driving the  uptake of of Oxen's Plus when in actual fact our average user it's actually doing the age of 45  
**[0:10:48-0:10:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:10:48):**  and 50 on the website so I wouldn't say that it's the younger generation or the coming back to the  farm what it is is the farmers right now or probably the last five years has been those  those farmers who are looking to do something different are looking to differentiate and to  
**[0:11:09-0:11:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:11:09):**  looking to get to capture maximum value out of whatever they're selling and so we look at it a  farmer has invested toiled energy money blood sweat and tears into growing this produce or  this item to throw it onto the open market with absolutely no control and get slammed by market  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:11:37):**  forces that are out of their control is really heart-wrenching and so it's really about how do  we shift the dial from sellers being price takers to price makers and that's obviously more than  just a role for a marketplace right like there's so much there that would require that shift to  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:11:58):**  happen and it's one of things I wanted to kind of focus on and I imagine people have questions on is  you know you guys have been around a long time you've gotten a bit of scale momentum you know  some good numbers and track record on the board elders behind you what do you see as your kind of  
**[0:12:10-0:12:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:12:10):**  role or ability to work with other startup ag tech players and and whether it's to help add value to  the growers or otherwise in the marketplace how do you going to see that strategy evolving yeah I'm  a big believer of you know the power of many and I think auctions plus five years ago when our my  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:12:31):**  former CEO Anna Speer was in the role it was just about getting momentum and it was just about  rolling that train forward and and and polishing it up so that it was there was a it started to  just travel so now that the train is moving and moving quite quickly it's about how can we bring  
**[0:12:54-0:13:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:12:54):**  farmers other ag tech businesses industry government non-for-profits services tools  information knowledge along for the ride and so definitely the future of auctions plus is not just  at that transaction it is the ecosystem of tools and services that surround that that transaction  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:13:20):**  and what's your vision or I guess at the next level of detail down for your role do you see  it as like a technical like you'll create the technical infrastructure to enable that is it  the the kind of top of the funnel marketing like you have farmer eyeballs and you can talk more  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:13:33):**  about this stuff is it like another kind of intervention how do you actually see you guys  enabling that vision yeah it's a really good point I think on a technical side I wouldn't say that we  are going to necessarily be the enablers of that because we have a core business which is a market  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:13:52):**  place as a transactional platform and so there are experts out there that are building AG tech  innovations that are specialists in their fields and have a I guess a dedicated vision for their  business what I see our role is a channel to market for those ag tech companies and a way to  
**[0:14:11-0:14:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:14:11):**  I guess leverage the success of auctions plus of the eyeballs traffic the website traffic our  connections so we're owned by Elders Landmark and Rulco and and it's you know as agents these are  the these are the men and women who are driving up the driveways every day of the week so as a  
**[0:14:32-0:14:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:14:32):**  distribution channel for technology it's kind of for us it's it's a no-brainer so yeah are you  getting so I mean in working with the startup space there's a real push to get into different  channels right and to work with these different players and the kind of common strategy is let's  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:14:51):**  go in through the Innovation Department or kind of going through the front door have you gotten  startups coming to you and saying let's go in through auctions plus to get distribution and  yeah definitely 100% I mean I think the Fairfax newspapers did some analysis of the top 10  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:15:09):**  websites that are visited in by rural and regional people in New South Wales and Queensland apart  from the Bureau of Meteorology elders weather and the weather zone app and the news sites we're the  only other website in that top 10 and we actually sit fifth and seventh in terms of website visits  
**[0:15:29-0:15:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:15:29):**  so which is so for us where and I think when I got the role as CEO it was a you you feel so  fortunate to be in this I feel so fortunate to be in this position because the organization is  looked at by a huge array of customers of other businesses of government of industry so to be  
**[0:15:56-0:16:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:15:56):**  able to play a role to enable and be that channel so they can leverage us and selfishly and  commercially we grow them it also grows us so yeah it's the you know it's that that ecosystem  model that a number of marketplaces are looking for a dog yeah one of the interesting challenges  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:16:20):**  for startups and working with bigger companies is the kind of cultural fit and that you're gonna  get like death by the slow maybe and you're never gonna kind of get in the door and you know it's  really hard to kind of have that cultural fit to really get things done do you and you mentioned  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:16:33):**  kind of startup culture before so tell me a little bit about the culture at auctions plus and do you  see that as like a way that you could work with startups kind of more easily or more quickly than  some of the big companies yeah definitely we're a super young teamer and what this is obviously you  
**[0:16:49-0:16:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:16:49):**  know there's some pain points that come with that but overarching Lee what comes with it is just an  enthusiasm a passion and an absolute dedication from that generation of individuals and you  harness that and magical things can happen and like we've seen it and it's something that Anna  
**[0:17:16-0:17:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:17:16):**  spear former CEO has kind of has looked at and has kind of driven or kicked off and I'm just kind of  now the custodian of that and saying well yes we might have gone past our startup phase and we've  got a report a little bit more and get a little bit more structure but no way in hell are we going  
**[0:17:40-0:17:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:17:40):**  to be corporate eyes no we're still going to give ourselves a flexibility in our strategy to pivot  to be opportunistic to have big bold ideas to chase the dream to run up rivers that you know  that are dead ends and one of the big things that we kind of talk about internally is and talked  
**[0:18:04-0:18:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:18:04):**  about globally but is you know fear of failure I talk about pie on your face and I encourage all  the guys it's okay to get pie on your face how our business our performance plans are actually  structured is not necessarily KPIs it is around intent so the positive intent and the desire that  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:18:32):**  like the unwavering desire to achieve something so if you're moving forward and you've got that  intent to achieve the desired outcome that is what from a very detailed performance do you would you  say your team is young like that's really young enough is it because the tech talent that you  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:18:51):**  have been able to find is that age or is it that like that's the kind of culture you've created or  like I guess it's even some of the other ag tech startups that we've probably all seen and worked  with I would say haven't been that young and have much smaller teams than you do so and I'm curious  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:19:05):**  about sort of why and also does that cause any kind of issues given that some of the average age  of the farmers they'd be working with are quite a bit older just from a customer empathy understanding  perspective are there any kind of challenges there yeah it's a good question and it probably  
**[0:19:20-0:19:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:19:20):**  we get away with it because obviously I bust the team up into a bus the business up into two kind  of times you've got our developers which are completely diverse bunch of men and women very  much multicultural and we've got Ken who leads it and he's been with the business for 22 years and  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:19:43):**  so he knows the system inside and out he's rebuilt it three times and he's about to rebuild it again  so he's in our tech team and then you've just got a huge array of I guess developers that are yes  a little bit older but you know I wouldn't say like they would be the older generation in the  
**[0:20:04-0:20:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:20:04):**  team then you come to our sales and our our farmer and assessor success teams our operations teams  and these are the guys that are on the front line that are on the phones day in day out and we we  have probably a third of them don't have an ag background but they have a passion for agriculture  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:20:27):**  they studied ag science and past well they studied ag echoes and and past it's tough to do it here  yeah yeah and and so they they've just got that innate passion for the ag sector and then the rest  are younger guys and girls who have come off a farm and so they have that ability to just have  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:20:50):**  a conversation like having a conversation to their dad or their grandfather and or then their neighbor  effectively and the ag sector is tiny and you really get to know when you're speaking to these  when these these graduates and you know first and second year kind of guys in the business  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:21:13):**  they're like oh g'day Bob it's it's Anna Holcomb here or it's you know it's Angus Street here and  they go oh you know my second and third cousin and it's just like everybody knows everybody  six degrees of separation so it's very important that we have that those guys have that empathy  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:21:33):**  and that understanding and in actual fact sometimes they can be too empathetic and it  and it holds back innovation and change what do you mean by that like what's an example oh it's  you know a lot of the guys families are struggling with drought a couple of guys have obviously  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:21:52):**  one of the guys in particular has been impacted by the floods and so they've got family who are  still on the ground and are feeling the impacts of ag life day in day out and so when we're saying  let's be bold let's be brave let's come up with this innovation they're kind of going  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:22:10):**  pump the brakes yeah pump the brakes and so it creates a what I like to call a healthy friction  you know because it's like well it's about putting it in front of them and then coaching and  empowering and and and and educating them and holding their hand all the way through yeah  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:22:25):**  interesting one probably area that we haven't touched on that I want to and then I'll open up  to the audience is given that you are owned by a bunch of companies that are agents and yet there's  I think I told you this like I get a call a month with the startup saying like we're out to disrupt  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:22:41):**  the livestock agents and we want to take back that five percent and help producers and like we need  something some marketplace or or disruption there do you like what do you see the role of auctions  plus being in that space given who owns you and given your ambition to work with startups and  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:22:55):**  enable startups and add value to growers like what's the plan yeah I'll I'll lift up a level  and then dive into that and I think it really does come from our our owners and the board directors  that sit on the board directors on the board they're not the shareholders and so they are the  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:23:15):**  shareholders but when they step into a boardroom and give a strategic direction they're wearing  their director's hat and so which is fantastic so I have a conversation with these guys once a  quarter you know what is the model to to evolve what is the model to disrupt and from their  
**[0:23:30-0:23:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:23:30):**  and from their perspective how how I said and they obviously have been openly said it but they know  that the agency model is going to evolve and so that evolution might be from one extreme completely  cut out to being more of a consultant through to a broker the financial or the pricing structure for  
**[0:23:58-0:24:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:23:58):**  all those services might change there is a evolution that is going to occur in livestock  agency traditional stock and station agent agency game they can either be corporates be a part  of the cannibalization or you know or wait for somebody to pop up and cannibalize them and so  
**[0:24:21-0:24:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:24:21):**  the business and hand on heart and I say this to all of the when I'm at an agency forum  so is that if I put to the board here is the business case the proof the analysis the technology  the data that justifies cutting out that assessor or that agency fee the board would say go ahead  
**[0:24:44-0:24:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322#t=0:24:44):**  so which is an amazing feeling to be supported by businesses that are could potentially be  cannibalized by yeah yeah what a cool position well I might leave it there for my question  thank you for joining us on another episode of agtech so what you can stay on the show

### Agtech - So What?  (2021-09-22)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to a very special episode of Ag Tech So What brought to you by the Ag  Fenty Group.  I'm Sarah Nolette.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:09):**  We're very pleased to say that this is our 100th episode and what a journey it's been  from idea to what I genuinely feel has become a global ag tech community.  So for this episode, we're doing something different.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:21):**  We're going to hear from you, our listeners, about the future of the ag tech industry.  We'll also hear from some of our most popular guests about what they've been up to and where  the future of the ag tech industry, in particular regenerative ag and soil carbon, is headed.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:36):**  Because while this podcast has grown, so too has the entire space.  And that's what it's all about ultimately.  Every conversation and story is about trying to move the needle.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:45):**  So have we?  My bullshit antennas even got even higher and at an even more attune than it was.  As soon as I hear someone talking about mother nature, my antenna just starts to sparkle  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:58):**  up and I'm going, oh my God, what's coming behind this is something a bit dangerous.  That is the thing that is becoming transformative is that people are striding into supply chains,  striding into retail, striding into seed or chemical or these other big places and saying,  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:17):**  I'm smart and capable and an asset to this company and I'm going to hold them accountable  to doing better.  And to me, that's a super hopeful story.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:27):**  You just heard from Sarah Mock, agriculture journalist and author.  And before that, Mark Wooten, known in Australia as the carbon neutral farmer.  We'll be checking in on what's happened since we last spoke to them and where they think  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:39):**  ag tech is headed.  We'll also hear from Stuart Austin from Wilmot Cattle Company, which has recently been in  the news for selling carbon credits to Microsoft.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:47):**  And we get an update from Derek Norman, VP of venture investments at Leaps by Bayer.  I couldn't do all of this alone today or any other day.  So it seems fitting to also bring in our producer Kirsten, or as we call her, Kdips.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:03):**  So where should we start Kdips?  Hey, happy 100th Sarah.  Oh, that makes me feel old.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:10):**  You're not old, but you've been here from the beginning, which it's been a few years,  I think, since you began maybe four or five.  And I'd actually like to ask you about the early days of the podcast later, just because  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:23):**  you're always talking about iterating.  So I think 100 episodes is a pretty decent milestone.  And I also thought it might be fun to pull out one of your early iterations.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:32):**  Oh, do we have to?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:36):**  Yeah.  There's an interesting intro that I think will be fun to play.  The pod even had a different name when you started.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:42):**  Yes.  It was called Bush Tech.  Ah, yeah.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:45):**  Okay.  But it was the intro music.  I think that was absolute gold and we're going to share it at the end of the episode.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:51):**  Great.  Well, looking forward to that.  In the meantime, let's bring in Mark Wooten.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:57):**  He is a mixed farmer in Hamilton, Victoria, who has really been a pioneer for carbon neutral  farming, which is why his comments on regenerative ag last year on the podcast were so surprising.  Well, I'm an atheist when it comes to regen ag.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:11):**  I think that that is an evangelical movement and I think that they need to come up with  the science and they keep coming and I keep saying, send me the science that shows me  peer reviewed science that shows me the outcome and not one of them has produced it yet.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:26):**  Not one.  So what's changed?  Has he been sent the science?  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:31):**  I caught up with Mark to find out.  Well, just on a practical level on the farm, we've had quite good seasons compared to other  parts of the world and we're producing and we've got probably record protein prices for  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:44):**  both most of our meat products.  So lamb, mutton and beef.  On another level, I've joined on the deputy chair of Victorian Agricultural Climate Change  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:53):**  Council, which is a state government based organisation.  And we are looking across the whole ag sector in Victoria and trying to identify potential  issues coming up, but more importantly, in terms of climate change opportunities.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:06):**  And what's the conversation like in terms of climate advocacy?  Like I guess my sense is there's been a bit of a tipping point.  I don't know if it's Covid and people have been doing more navel gazing or bushfires.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:16):**  Do you feel like things are accelerating?  I feel like on an individual, on a community, on a corporate basis, it definitely is moving.  The recent IPCC report that just came out has just highlighted the fact that we're going  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:31):**  to get to where we didn't want to get to about 10 years earlier.  That's just in broad language.  We're going to hell in a handbasket and we need to actually start acting.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:41):**  So farmers are very, very attuned to risk and they're looking at this as an opportunity  to make sure that they minimise their risk.  And it's a good space to be actually.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:52):**  I have very little debates about climate change and whether humans are causing it anymore.  It's just virtually a non-topic.  It's just, okay, let's not worry about that, but what can we do?  
**[0:05:02-0:05:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:02):**  It's all focused on future.  That's super exciting.  I mean, that's been my sense too, but I sometimes think I'm kind of preaching to the choir a  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:09):**  little bit.  Are you seeing that around adoption of technology as well as people are less sceptical maybe  of climate and seeing this as a threat risk, but also an opportunity?  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:19):**  I think it's happening.  I mean, I'm involved in a, I chair a little independent panel for the government on basically  energy reduction, which is a lot of it's about renewables and it's a $60 million program.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:33):**  So it's a useful one.  It's oversubscribed and farmers have got to that point where they've got the neighbour  or the case study up the road.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:40):**  They can go look at someone who's adopted, whether it's a more efficient irrigation pump  or they've moved into solar or they're looking at whatever the systems are they're operating  in and they're just taking it up.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:51):**  And it's a 50 50 scheme.  So I have to put their half their own money in and the adoption in that it's just accelerating.  Now they're going to run out of money again.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:59):**  So it's a good, it just shows you people are voting with their feet.  Our view, and we covered this on the bonus podcast we've just put out and a blog we wrote,  the incentives don't fully align in terms of who benefits.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:11):**  And a lot of this will come from pull in the supply chain.  If you've got a meat processor offering different grid prices for something that can prove certain  environmental outcomes, or if you've got incentives downstream in the supply chain to adopt technology  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:25):**  that makes you more efficient, et cetera, that can be another, I guess, leverage point,  not just kind of 50 50 matching from government.  So hopefully we'll see more of those private sector and supply chain incentives coming  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:36):**  too.  And I think that's the key.  It can't be, it can't be, you know, the, the, the government can't involve themselves overly  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:44):**  in another actors lead, you know, and showed by example.  And I think that, you know, you look at meat quality as an issue of purchasing, that's  where it's happening.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:52):**  And that's what will happen.  I think with the carbon footprint stuff and the meat processes of saying that the consumer  wants to have eating quality.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:59):**  And so therefore they've set up the grid accordingly and the testing.  So you can trace individual carcasses going through different plants and that's all just  taking off and people are going, Oh my God, I never realized that we could do this.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:12):**  And now there's momentum because people want to go and they, you know, you spending a lot  of money on a product.  They want to have a guaranteed outcome when they put it into their own household situation.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:24):**  When you came on the podcast, Mark, I definitely don't think I expected this, but the episode  we did was one of the most popular episodes that we've ever done.  Nothing against you, but I just wasn't sure how ready the market was for a focus on regenerative  
**[0:07:36-0:07:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:36):**  agriculture.  And I was blown away by the response and your episode in particular, I think struck a chord  with people because of how you farm and who you are and your success and yet your skepticism  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:47):**  over the term regen.  What was the response you received after coming on the podcast?  Did you get any feedback?  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:54):**  Well, if you were surprised Sarah, I was even more surprised because I had, there was a  climate chorus as I call them.  They, they, they came forward and were very sympathetic and keen that we do things that  
**[0:08:08-0:08:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:08):**  we do.  But I also had a number of anxious people.  I'll put it that way, contacted me about some of the, that might have been a bit hard on  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:16):**  regen having to put some science behind their claims.  And of those people who did contact me, if you did say they were going to send me data,  and none have.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:25):**  So I'm still back where I was.  There's a data vacuum in this spot.  I've met my, to be crude with you, my bullshit antennas even got even higher and at an even  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:36):**  more attuned than it was.  As soon as I hear someone talking about mother nature, my antenna just starts to sparkle  up and I'm going, oh my God, what's coming behind this is something a bit dangerous.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:48):**  And that doesn't mean I'm not looking at it critically.  I mean, I'm not anti the concept of regenerative, that sort of like, it's a, you know, it's  a beautiful phrase.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:58):**  I just think it's been co-opted in different ways.  I mean, it's, I think it's moved in a much more positive direction now though.  I think there's a lot more data and people doing it.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:07):**  I think some of the cases that have come forward, unfortunately, like the Wilmon Ag where Microsoft  forwarded and stuff, unfortunately that seems to be a bit not properly verified.  And there's, there's a whole scientific discussion going on about that.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:20):**  So I get papers on this as well.  So I'm getting belted from all sides on it.  The message I really would be like people to take home is that you're still better doing  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:30):**  something, even if it's not perfect than doing nothing.  And that's why I would still, even with my bullshit antenna, very heightened, I still  would rather than be working in this space than going back and doing nothing.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:42):**  So I don't, I don't want to be as negative as perhaps I was in that podcast.  Sarah, I feel like at this point, it would be really good to bring in Stuart Austin.  He's the general manager of Wilmot Cattle Company, who Mark just actually mentioned  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:55):**  then.  And you happen to also interview him for this podcast.  Yes.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:00):**  Well, first I spoke to him back in 2019 and this year there's been some big news for Wilmot,  as I said before, where they announced that they're selling half a million dollars worth  of soil carbon credits to Microsoft in what was a pretty landmark deal.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:12):**  Yeah, it's huge.  I mean, just to think a farm in New South Wales and granted, it's a very professional  operation.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:20):**  It's owned by the MacDoc group, but it means that farmers can actually sell carbon credits  to a company like Microsoft.  It's a big deal.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:30):**  Yeah, exactly.  And that's where we started this conversation when I caught up again with Stu.  There certainly has been a lot that's going on in the last couple of years.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:38):**  So it's been exciting.  I mean, yeah, 2019 was a pretty tough year in terms of fires and droughts and de-stocking  and kind of just some respects idling along waiting for the good times.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:49):**  And that all happened in January, February, 2020.  Things changed considerably, started to rain and we really cranked things up and got back  to business as usual, I suppose, in that 2020 year.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:04):**  And then towards the back end of 2020 was when things started to transpire around our  carbon credit deal.  It was sort of all happening in the back end, I suppose.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:11):**  And then as you well know, early this year, that deal was announced through the Regen  Network with Microsoft.  And so that led to the last, or the first six months of this year, my life was basically  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:22):**  consumed by soil carbon talking, a lot of talking and a lot of discussion and a lot  more talking, which was terrific.  I mean, that was one of the big reasons we did that deal was, yes, there was a financial  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:31):**  gain in there for us, but it was also around the rubber hitting the road and someone getting  a deal done relating to soil carbon and the world recognising that soil carbon was a real  thing and very valuable and had a lot to offer in terms of opportunity for landholders, not  
**[0:11:47-0:11:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:47):**  only in Australia, but around the world.  And how we need to consider integrating technology or the use of technology into soil carbon  measurement.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:56):**  It was really exciting just to see how the whole conversation just escalated so dramatically  over the last six months in terms of, you know, now there's all kinds of players coming  into the market and all different fronts and people coming to market with different measurement  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:12):**  and modelling methods using technology.  And I think it's just fantastic.  Yeah, it's kind of one thing to be first, like the expression that comes to mind is  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:19):**  you want to be on the leading edge, not the bleeding edge.  But some might argue that you're on the bleeding edge for some of this stuff in kind of an  experimental field.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:28):**  What do you say when others ask you, you know, is it ready?  Should they get involved?  Can other farmers sell credits to Microsoft?  
**[0:12:35-0:12:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:35):**  Yeah, look, it is.  And we do, I suppose, deflect to the ERF model as being, you know, when people are at the  start of the journey and there's a thought there in terms of the grazing management journey.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:47):**  So they just that practice time is just starting.  You know, we say the best thing for you to do is yes, to talk to one of the carbon developers,  project developers and see, get them to do that desktop analysis and study and scoping  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:00):**  analysis on your farm, because every farm is different and see what opportunity there  might be, because once you start on the grazing management journey, then that's when the upside  starts.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:10):**  So the more of that upside you can capture and the sooner you can start the project,  the sooner you'll be able to capture that upside.  So that existing model is already there.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:18):**  What we did, yes, was the first, it was the first that Regen had ever done.  It was the first soil carbon credit Microsoft had ever bought.  It was the first significant soil carbon credit that had been traded at scale.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:29):**  In some respects, it's not necessarily a downside, but the downside to us now is that we're locked  into that.  We're committed to that methodology, that program with the Regen network.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:39):**  You know, there's a whole bunch of complexities around the fact that even though we registered  these two farms for under the ERF model, now that we've sold carbon off these farms under  a different model, they have to be removed from that ERF project for a whole bunch of  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:52):**  different reasons.  So in some respects, we've kind of tied our hands a bit, but on the plus side, it just  means that we work really closely with the Regen network to continue to improve the rigour  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:02):**  and the accuracy and the integrity of their methodology.  Which means bringing in other technology, other models, et cetera, whatever we can get  our hands on.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:11):**  One of the things you said is that you've now become a pretty hot commodity in terms  of speaking about this stuff and getting asked to share your journey.  What's that been like for you?  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:20):**  Do you ever feel like you're doing more talking than farming and do you like talking?  I think you're doing pretty well now, Sarah.  I don't mind a yarn.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:30):**  I'm very passionate about sharing our story.  And yes, by default, I've become kind of a MacBook ad group spokesperson, but I don't  know, I suppose I do it reasonably well and I do really enjoy it.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:43):**  And I really enjoy the fact that it helps other people, you know, when the messages  that I get or the phone calls that I get, you know, Stu can always have you only about  this.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:50):**  And I've got all the time in the world to do that because we don't do that enough as  an industry.  We don't pick up the phone and ask him out for, you know, for some info or some help  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:58):**  or advice.  So, yeah, it's been great.  And as we've said all along, this is an additional revenue stream.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:05):**  We're not stopping food production and starting carbon production.  We're continuing food production that carbon is still in our soil on this farm.  We have just a major corporate business that needs to offset their emissions.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:17):**  As I said, we really like that story and the fact that you are taking that carbon out of  the atmosphere and we'd like to buy that credit from you.  So we still get all the benefits from the carbon in our soil.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:25):**  So that's been a real positive.  I think, you know, it was only in the last couple of months, I suppose, that that evolved.  Back when you came on the podcast in 2019, we did talk about regenerative agriculture  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:38):**  and the kind of stigma that exists or existed and how it was moving, I guess, from witchcraft  to solid business practices.  I guess does that stigma still exist?  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:48):**  No, I think the momentum is continuing to grow and particularly coming out of the drought,  there was a huge increase in interest, I suppose.  I've always said that one of the greatest catalyst for change is pain.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:02):**  You know, you read anyone's miracle story, it was a bloody life threatening event that  led to them performing miracles.  And so that's what happened to a bloody big portion of the industry.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:11):**  They came out of the drought and I went, holy shit, I did not ever want to go through that  again.  Tell me a different way.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:16):**  Tell me how you got through it without feeling like we did or ending up like we did.  So it has been fantastic.  Everyone's got such a broad spectrum of theories around regenerative agriculture, what it is,  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:27):**  what it means, how you do it, practices versus principles, etc., etc.  But certainly I think the recognition is growing as to how important it is that we focus on  soil health from a biological perspective.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:38):**  Yes, the carbon piece has certainly added some weight to that.  People are kind of putting the two and two together a bit now.  That's one thing that regen ag skeptics want to see is where's the data, where's the science  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:50):**  and what can you really point to in this space?  How do you answer that question?  We've got it all and I'm more than willing to show people that, demonstrate that.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:59):**  There's certainly not much of our business that we haven't put out in the public forum.  And the other thing that I try really hard not to do is create that really confrontational  discussion around regen ag.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:11):**  Here's what we do.  We're sharing this to help other people.  Take it or leave it.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:15):**  I don't mind if you don't believe in it.  That's fine.  All the best.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:18):**  I'm surrounded by people who are, and I just don't get in those polarizing discussions.  And when I do, I say, that's okay.  No dramas.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:26):**  That's fine.  You continue to manage the way you do that.  I've got no qualms with that.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:29):**  And it comes back to you can't help those who don't want to be helped and people aren't  interested, but that's fine.  You talked a little bit about it last time when you came on the podcast in terms of using  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:39):**  grazing management software with my grazing, any other tech that you've been using to collect  that data and do that, make sure it is rigorous.  Well, the regen network stuff, that was all Sentinel imagery stuff that I still don't  
**[0:17:52-0:17:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:52):**  fully understand, but do to some extent.  And we probably built on that, I suppose, with FarmLab with Sam Duncan.  We've just started to use his platform, plugging all our data.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:01):**  We've got so much data, particularly soil data now, and it started to be measured by  Carbon Link and RCS took some samples.  And so we've got all these soil samples and it has to this point been housed in a real  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:14):**  big beast of a spreadsheet of bats that can do all sorts of great things.  And he can drive it and I can drive it and not many others can.  But all that other data that we've also been collecting on, I wanted to put it in one place  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:26):**  and then expand on that with some of that mapping capability.  And that's what I think is exciting is being able to extrapolate data analysis out across  the whole farm using some of those different satellite imagery tools.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:38):**  You mentioned before that you're sort of being seen as a carbon farmer now, is there any  downside to being seen as a carbon farmer when again, that's just one aspect of your  business, as you said before, you're still producing food and even carbon is not your  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:52):**  main commodity?  Yep, it's interesting.  One of the I've got somewhat of a template for a presentation nowadays and that is one  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:01):**  line in there is that we don't call ourselves carbon farmers.  You know, our guys get out of bed every day to think about how they can grow more grass,  produce more kilos of beef and make more money from beef production.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:11):**  That's their primary focus.  And that's why we always talk about this, the carbon credit as an additional revenue  stream and a kind of co-benefit of our beef production business.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:20):**  So yeah, plenty of people call us carbon farmers.  I suppose that's where we, like I said earlier, where we're kind of building a bit of an understanding  of the difference between what we've done versus what, say guys in Western New South  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:34):**  or Western Queensland are doing with human induced reveg projects or those other sort  of carbon methodologies that are, that's where the majority of acues have been generated  to this point.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:44):**  And for the most part, those guys are making more money from carbon than they are from  protein production, I suppose, where we're sort of saying, no, no, our production business  is still as it was.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:53):**  We're also relying on top of that an additional revenue stream through soil carbon credit.  Well there's more than one way to skin a cat when it comes to carbon.  Yeah, it's such an early field, but super exciting.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:05):**  And both Stuart and Mark Wooten are pioneers in what they're doing.  While they do have a different approach, I'd say they probably have more similarities than  they do differences.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:13):**  Yeah, I'd agree with that.  And they've really started a conversation that's just become more mainstream, certainly  within Australia and beyond.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:21):**  I mean, after our podcast with Mark Wooten, he then appeared on a documentary done by  the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  It was called Fight for Planet A.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:30):**  Yeah, so I actually asked him about this and he received an interesting response from the  public.  Well, I foolishly said on that show, if you want to have a guilt free steak, we'll sell  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:44):**  you one.  And we had a litany of very well-meaning, very thoughtful consumers that must have found  our web page and then wrote to us saying, where did we get a steak from you?  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:58):**  And we had to write back and say, that's not how we do it.  This is not the scalable.  But again, I'm hoping that I'm wrong on that.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:06):**  And in the future, we can.  The supply chain and exactly what you're touching on before actually allows for market differentiation  from our sheep or lamb or beef as it goes through that mainstream process.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:20):**  And we're getting rewarded accordingly.  And hopefully the retailer gets rewarded accordingly too.  And that's where we've got to make sure that we do it.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:30):**  Interestingly enough, going back to the Wilmont example, one of the key things that's happened  since that for me going forward is putting aside the whole debate about regen and verification  and permanence, which is a debate within.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:43):**  Let's just put all that to one side for the moment.  I think farmers need to critically think about whether they are going to sell their carbon  credits to third party or they're going to keep them for their own product, particularly  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:54):**  at lower rates.  I think that is a really commercial decision they have to focus on.  And for some, it's a logical thing that they do it now.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:02):**  And for others like us, we're not selling.  We're keeping it as we will not be able to say we have a carbon neutral product if we  sell them off to third parties to offset their own emissions.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:11):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, there's a big question there around I mean, the input companies now want to claim  
**[0:22:17-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:17):**  these offsets and do that through the farmers they supply.  The downstream companies want to do it through the farmers they procure from.  The farmers are going to have to claim some kind of carbon neutrality and like, you know,  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:27):**  there's only so many credits to go around.  And then to your point about all the other risks, I'm not at all advocating for doing  nothing, but like you said, sort of thinking about this space and the evolution versus  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:36):**  maybe some of the people coming knocking on the door saying you can make a quick buck.  It's pretty challenging to actually make a decision.  And where do you draw the line?  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:45):**  We say our line is at our farm gate when the product leaves, because that's where our control  ends.  And that's the sheep's sustainability framework, which comes out as worked on that from an  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:54):**  animal welfare perspective.  It's worked on that from a carbon, it's worked on it from an environmental point of view.  That's the line, because then each the parties transport or the processes or the retail and  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:06):**  have to be responsible for their own element.  That's a complicated story to say to consumers though.  But people are getting their head around this, that if you do sell off your carbon credits  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:17):**  now to third parties, you can't sell it.  It's barley, you can only sell your barley once, you can't sell it twice.  And that's the analogy I use.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:25):**  The other thing, which is quite critical going forward in terms of farmers is that they need  to be conscious that as they get better at their production system and they lower their  footprint, maybe to carbon positive, they can sell some to third parties, but they need  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:41):**  to have better measurement within their own systems.  And that's really challenging because of the vagaries of, the biggest thing with the carbon  soil change is predominantly you can really match it on rainfall levels.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:53):**  So those who have had good years, all of a sudden their carbon changes dramatically.  And so it's terrifying because the market, the market know this and then consumers know  that the risk is they'll go, this is all too hard.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:06):**  I'm not doing any of it because they're all crooks and we'll all be painted with the same  brush.  And that's one of the reasons I'm probably quite critical of parties that are involved.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:14):**  It's my credibility could be attacked as being a farmer in general, if some farmers do dodgies  on the side.  Yeah, I think that's right.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:22):**  We've talked about a few solutions.  So technology, kind of supply chain incentives, government, what else needs to change in the  conversation in Australia or globally around ag and climate change?  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:33):**  Well, I think I still think the consumer has a really powerful position to play.  If they demand of the retailer that they want this product, which is certified verifiable  going forward, then I think you'll find that you will have more that demand will drag it  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:51):**  through the system.  People respond to price signals.  They do.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:55):**  I mean, we won't be any different if there's a price signal.  We've signed up with ZQ, the New Zealand bull brand, which is mainly based on the sportswear  market, icebreaker and that type of product.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:04):**  And they've now got an RX part of it, which is regen and carbon side on it.  And we've got that.  And they're going to use our own brand to talk about our biodiversity and that whole  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:14):**  enviro story we've got, which is probably a significant, probably more significant to  us than the carbon side, to be honest with you.  We just planted here physically.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:23):**  We just planted just over 24,000 trees into these linkages plantations just in the last  month.  And as soon as you get people engaged in this space, they start my children and my, you  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:33):**  know, all of their friends all came out and volunteered in their own, their twenties.  They wanted to actively be involved in solutions.  There's a lot of goodwill in this space and we just need to make sure to give people hope.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:46):**  We don't want to just say the IPC reports, you know, we're heading to hell on a handbasket,  but you can't do anything about it.  I mean, why would we keep doing what we're doing?  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:54):**  Why would you keep doing what you do?  I do love a philosophical question, Sarah, because that's often what it comes down to.  And one guest we had last year, I think really spent her entire career asking, why am I doing  
**[0:26:08-0:26:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:08):**  what I'm doing?  Yes, Sarah Mock, who grew up on a farm in Wyoming.  She's worked for some high profile ag tech startups like Farmers Business Network, but  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:17):**  has really made a name for herself as an ag journalist and an author with some pretty  provocative but well thought out perspectives.  Yeah.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:25):**  And the thing about Sarah Mock is like her whole reason for writing is led by a mission  to find out what's actually working in ag, what's making a difference, what's breaking  down some of those traditional barriers and just simply what is a good farm.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:40):**  And I think people really like her because she's so brutally honest and really not worried  about ruffling any feathers.  But like you said, in a thought out way.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:48):**  Yeah, that's right.  She's not afraid to make a statement and not afraid to back them up and, you know, genuinely  wants to move the conversation forward, all of which is pretty rare in this space.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:58):**  Since we last spoke to her, she's actually released a book called Farm and Other F-words,  which is all about what makes a small family farm work or not work so well.  That's where I began my conversation with Sarah asking her how the book release went.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:12):**  It went amazing.  I mean, I did a pre-release where I raised some funds to get to do the launch before,  you know, six months or so before I actually published and got a ton of support, which  
**[0:27:23-0:27:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:23):**  was very shocking and surprising to me.  I'm still, I still live in the world day to day where I assume that it's mostly just my  parents reading everything I write.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:31):**  And when actual real people in the world show up to read it, it's very exciting.  Well, congratulations.  Tell me, tell me another story.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:38):**  What's, what's something that's happened as a result of writing the book that you're excited  about?  Yeah.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:43):**  I mean, so many people have just like reached out to me and wanted to chat more about what  they're working on, or I get asked a lot how farmers respond and react to the book because  there are some hot takes, I will say within its pages.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:58):**  And you know, the thing is I've been really surprised and excited to hear that a lot of  farmers have actually been like, thank goodness that this book was written because I appreciate  this perspective a lot.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:09):**  And like, this is a part there's so much basically like weird patriotic, like jargon in the industry  and not enough of talking about just like, yeah, but it's not just about being tough  and this being like a legacy business and it being about like feeding the world.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:29):**  It's also a business and it's also entrepreneurship and it's also tough and like all these other  ways.  And I think, you know, people in the book, people adjacent to the book read it and were  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:39):**  like, Oh my gosh, I feel so seen and validated.  And that has been really great.  And yeah, like they're more than just a symbol.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:50):**  I so appreciated the exploration of all the different kinds of farms.  And I feel like it probably just cause it echoed a bit of my personal journey and like,  what is a farm?  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:00):**  What is a good farm?  How do we think about these different farms?  And I could sort of visualize you, like, I'm sure it didn't actually happen in the linear  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:06):**  way that it sort of unfolds in each chapter.  I mean, it sounds like a quest that many of us including yourself are kind of still on  to figure out like, I mean, people talk about farmers.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:16):**  There's no one kind of farmer.  There are many kinds of farms and our view of what a good farm is and can be is shifting.  Has your view, like, where are you up to on your view of farms and good farms and big  
**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:28):**  farm team?  Oh man, that is such a hard question, especially as I get into working on the second half of  this book, that's going to come out in late spring 2022.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:39):**  You know, it was fun.  I was just talking the other day about how I, the only reason I started doing journalism  and was basically because I had worked in the ag industry for a couple of years and  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:48):**  I had really mixed feelings about the work I was doing and about whether or not it was  impactful, whether or not it was the best use of my skills and about where the most  important work in agriculture is.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:57):**  And I got into journalism to try and actually pay rent while I tried to answer those questions.  And five years later, I don't know that I have great answers yet.  And that's kind of discouraging because I just, one, like things are shifting really  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:13):**  fast and people like new ideas are coming up and being explored.  Like the number of farms that have started and failed within the time that I have been  reporting on them is incredible and crazy and sad.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:26):**  And I have so many emotions about all of that.  So where am I in my journey of what is a farm and what it looks like?  I think I wrote the book and the big climax is just this idea of maybe farms could learn  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:40):**  some of the lessons that other places, entrepreneurial realms have learned.  Things like your people are your most important asset or pursue profit, find opportunities,  that those kinds of ideas could be really transformative in agriculture and on farms  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:54):**  in particular.  And in the second book, going out and trying to find people who are already putting those  kind of big team farm ideas into practice, there's not that many, if there's any.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:07):**  People are doing parts of it.  Different people are doing different parts and I think that's important.  There's certainly people who are pursuing that kind of a really strong kind of human  
**[0:31:17-0:31:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:17):**  community or environmental ethic.  There's certainly people who are out there working really hard to empower their employees  and to make them part of their systems.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:23):**  And there's certainly people who are out there who are being economically successful, which  I think is a really key piece.  I haven't really found anyone or at least very few who are able to tie those three things  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:36):**  together.  And I think that's been really important.  It's been disappointing, I think, but also really important from a personal perspective  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:43):**  for me of just like people like me, I guess I'm like a bit of a theorist.  And then also I think a lot of people who look to agriculture as a way to do social  impact work or a way to do social impact investing, want it to be all those things.  
**[0:31:56-0:31:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:56):**  And maybe it can't.  Maybe it can't be all things to all people all the time.  And maybe we need to have a really thoughtful conversation about what we give up when we  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:06):** ... What are the most important things and what might we actually be willing to give  up with or what might we be willing to pursue in a more limited way?  And yeah, I think that is not where I was when I had just finished writing the first  
**[0:32:19-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:19):**  book when I was like, no, big team farms are going to change everything and it's going  to be great and no worries.  It's totally fine.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:24):**  And I think I've at this point, having visited a bunch of farms that I had put in that category  before and had a lot of really tough conversations with folks, I'm in a little bit more of a  place of saying, paradigm shifts are hard, change is hard.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:37):**  It takes a lot of energy.  And I think we have a long road ahead.  Yes.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:41):**  And do you think we hold farms?  I know this is a bigger question, but maybe quick comments to... And why if we do, like  different standards than other businesses, it strikes me there's lots of reasons we don't  
**[0:32:54-0:32:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:54):**  think of them as businesses in the traditional sense.  And so we kind of hold them to a different standard.  Totally.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:00):**  Yeah.  And I think that plays to their advantage and to their disadvantage at different times.  I mean, I think part of it is just like the fact that there's such a strong interaction  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:09):**  with nature and impact on nature.  I think that conversation gets really philosophical really fast of just like, maybe we can't harvest  food from nature without damaging it, even though we really want to not damage it.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:21):**  I think we also let farms off a lot on it.  I think on the other side too, because of the way we've pastoralized and idealized farm  work, we also make a lot of exceptions for farm work, which it can be to farmer's advantage  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:39):**  a lot because we're like, oh, you don't need to be paid to do that.  It's so fun.  It's so easy.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:43):**  It's so natural.  It's so human.  But on the other side, it's also because of the economics of the farm system we've set  
**[0:33:48-0:33:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:48):**  up that assumed all of those first things, we've created a system where it's actually  very hard to respectfully create work with dignity that pays people well, that also leads  to a product that is affordable to people.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:02):**  And I think that is the third piece is, oh, how much food is allowed to cost is a whole  part of this conversation.  And that is a society-wide question for us about, is food a human right?  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:15):**  Should people be allowed to starve to death?  Or should food be something that we are entitled to?  But at the same time, in practice, a lot of times, because we realize those unrealistic  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:27):**  standards are there, we kind of just let farmers off the hook for everything because we're  just like, oh, we don't know where to put the bar with those super unrealistic standards.  So we just put it down at like, are you a farmer?  
**[0:34:40-0:34:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:40):**  Then you must be good.  Yes.  I mean, the thing that comes to my head always is like good, fast, and cheap.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:46):**  And those aren't the three things that you're putting on the edge of those triangles, but  you can't have all of them.  And we accept that in other areas of business, but exactly that in farming, we haven't quite  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:54):**  figured out what is okay and what is the standard.  When we spoke to you, I think it was your Twitter profile that said it, and we kind  of framed the episode as making windows in the walls around agriculture.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:04):**  Has anything changed?  Are there more windows now?  Is ag as an industry shifting, more diverse, more able to be criticized or introspective?  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:13):**  Yeah.  You know, I'm just one person trying to like get a view of like this really enormous and  complex thing.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:21):**  So from, I can only speak from my like very personal perspective, but the very cool thing  about this whole process of writing the book, putting out the book, and then starting on  the research for the second book was having the number of conversations I've had with  
**[0:35:31-0:35:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:31):**  folks who are working right now in the conventional ag industry.  And it's just like young to mid-career thoughtful folks who are working because we live in a  capitalist society where you have to work to buy food and take care of your family for  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:48):**  these industries, for these companies, for these organizations that like they know have  done evil things in the past.  And they are there and ready to work to say like, listen, I am here to hold this place  
**[0:36:01-0:36:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:01):**  accountable.  I'm here to work and to do good things in the world.  And to, you know, when a big company says, oh, we have a sustainability agenda now, or  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:09):**  we're going to do, you know, we're going to set up a data program, but it's not going  to be exploitative of farmers.  There is this new wave or this wave of young people and workers in this space that I am  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:22):**  just meeting who are saying, yeah, well, I'm going to be like a thoughtful employee at  this company and I'm going to hold them to that.  And I'm going to like, I know that, you know, just because they write my, they sign my paychecks  
**[0:36:32-0:36:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:32):**  doesn't mean that they're like an infallible company and that the work I'm doing here is  going to be good.  But I'm not going to be responsible for taking advantage of farmers, taking advantage of  
**[0:36:41-0:36:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:41):**  consumers, creating false marketing, putting something out into the environment that's  not safe or creating a product that isn't backed by science that I trust.  And in my mind, like, you know, regulations are important.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:53):**  Changing companies, you know, policies and principles are really important.  But the only way to make all that stuff stick is to have people on the inside who believe  in that stuff.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:37:03):**  And to me, that is the most, you know, that is the thing that is becoming transformative  is that people are coming to work in agriculture, not just on like fun, tiny, sustainable farms  or in little ways, but are striding into supply chains, striding into retail, striding into  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:37:22):**  seed or chemical or these other big places and saying, I'm smart and capable and an asset  to this company and I'm going to hold them accountable to doing better.  And to me, that's a super hopeful story.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:37:35):**  There's also been a change of president in the US since we spoke.  What are your thoughts about the Biden administration's approach to ag and tech and climate change?  Yeah.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:37:50):**  Biden is not actively rolling back environmental regulation, worker regulation.  You know, President Trump, as he was leaving office, held wages for farm workers in the  H2A program constant.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:03):**  You know, that kind of stuff that happens right at the end of a president's term is  often overlooked, but can have like long lasting effects that are very detrimental to the industry  and to workers and to so many different people.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:16):**  But it's exciting that we have a new president.  It's exciting that he is so focused on climate change and having a different kind of conversation  in that industry has really been cognizant of that, I think, and it's really kind of  
**[0:38:27-0:38:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:27):**  turning in a way to see that.  But the Biden administration is still doing a lot, especially at USDA, still spending  a lot of time just trying to unwind some of the problematic, like, you know, the family  
**[0:38:39-0:38:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:39):**  food box program at USDA was a gigantic garbage fire.  So you know, I think the focus on climate change will be good.  I'm a little my biggest worry, I will say, is that the Biden administration is going  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:50):**  to move too quickly into a carbon market.  I think the USDA has a role to play in establishing a standard, just like they have a role to  play in establishing a standard across agricultural commodities.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:01):**  But if USDA goes straight to having a bank, or setting controls on things, I think that  will be one, it will cement in place a program that as long as it's still controlled by the  private sector is agile and able to move and change and develop in ways that it really  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:19):**  still needs to, because the science is not ready yet.  And yeah, as soon as USDA gets involved, it's stuck, right?  It's frozen, because whatever the policy is, is just like how people will change their  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:28):**  businesses and build their whole systems around exactly how the USDA program works.  And the USDA isn't ready to build a program yet.  So I'm hoping the Biden administration is hearing that feedback that I know a lot of  
**[0:39:38-0:39:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:38):**  people are telling them.  I hope they are not rushing to send money out the door to provide this feedback.  I hope they're thinking, they're spending time being thoughtful about how they can be  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:49):**  a regulatory party first and not a market creator first.  You know, obviously, I would love to see USDA just ramp up some regulation, maybe that's  EPA's role.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:59):**  But, you know, put some let's all decide together how farms should operate in a way that is  not actively, you know, you probably shouldn't be able to sell carbon credits if you're an  emitter.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:09):**  So maybe let's help farmers stop being emitters, and then we'll be so ready for the carbon  market.  Thank you.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:15):**  You know, Sarah, it's amazing how many roads seem to lead back to carbon.  It's been such an incredibly popular topic on this podcast.  Yeah, and it's because it's such an entirely new space and opening up new revenue streams,  
**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:27):**  especially for farmers, but also agribusinesses and big corporations in this space.  And even though it's early, we do actually have to act quickly if we're going to move  the needle on climate change, which ultimately is what it's all about.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:39):**  We're looking hard at the evolving tech landscape and actually through our firm Tenacious Ventures  have made a couple investments in this space like Regrow and Nori.  But we really wanted to include a corporate venture perspective too in this episode.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:50):**  So we brought back Derek Norman, VP of venture investment at Leaps by Bear, another one of  our really popular guests.  Yes, I remember the episode well.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:58):**  It was about 18 months ago.  It was done as a live event with Tim Hammarich, who's the host of the Future of Agriculture  podcast and Jim Chambers from Trimble was in it too.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:09):**  So does Derek talk about Carbon too when you spoke to him this time?  Yes, actually he does.  And a lot of other exciting innovations in ag tech that are kind of coming out in this  
**[0:41:19-0:41:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:19):**  space around emissions reduction.  Actually he started the conversation though with how much the COVID-19 pandemic as horrible  as it is, has actually sped up investment in ag tech.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:30):**  I think looking back when we spoke originally, it was still sort of fairly early in this  new era of COVID and sort of just changing the way we work.  And I think one of the big questions then I think for all investors was sort of how  
**[0:41:44-0:41:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:44):**  that would continue.  I think we all had investment pipelines at that time that were at fairly mature stages  and you could sort of see how you might move things that were in the end of that pipeline  
**[0:41:54-0:41:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:54):**  through to completion.  But then after that, it became a little less clear.  I think that was a big question mark, but I think now if you look back, I mean, obviously  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:02):**  I think everybody's talking about just the investment pace is extremely rapid.  It hasn't slowed anything down at all.  And I think if anything, it's really increased.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:12):**  I think many reasons for that.  I think one maybe partially it's because there's no obligation to visit companies and now it's  coming back a little bit, but for a long time it was almost impossible to visit companies.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:24):**  So in some ways just shortens the process.  And then I think sort of an unintended consequence of people not traveling is sort of freed up  everybody's schedule.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:32):**  So it actually made it easier to pace projects more quickly and just sort of follow up quickly.  And so I think it's just that plus capital markets, right?  There's just sort of plenty of capital flowing, the stock market's done well and sort of everything  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:45):**  is trickled down and that extends to the venture capital markets where there's sort of a strong  appetite to continue investing and taking risk coupled with, sorry for the longer answer  here.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:56):**  But then I think everybody now realized, like, look at, looks at big sort of dislocations  that can happen.  And we live in a very nonlinear world all of a sudden.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:04):**  So you look at COVID and then you might extend it to other things happening in the world.  And so there's also very big problems that face us.  And I think there's absolutely a greater awareness of it, not just awareness, but sort of a feeling  
**[0:43:18-0:43:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:18):**  of taking action by entrepreneurs and investors.  There's a whole conversation there, but I will move on.  So you, LEAPS has a focus on tech and innovation that, as you mentioned before, reduces the  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:29):**  environmental impacts of agriculture, that kind of mission focus that we're seeing more  interest in, in the space.  I've also heard you talk about, you know, paradigm shifts as kind of a concept.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:38):**  What are some of the paradigm shifts you're excited about in any of the technologies or  specific startups, if you can say, that you think are kind of leading the way around these  major paradigm shifts in ag?  
**[0:43:49-0:43:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:49):**  Sure.  I could think of a couple of projects that maybe they're run through.  You know, we've actually announced a couple of investments recently in an area that there  
**[0:43:57-0:44:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:57):**  are, you know, there's many companies, I think, taking approaches here and approaching the  problem differently, but in the field of nitrogen fixation.  So we've announced an investment in sound agriculture and in a company called Andy's  
**[0:44:09-0:44:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:09):**  Agriculture, and they each have quite complimentary approaches to sort of solving the problem  of helping crops produce their own nitrogen, rather than requiring the use of synthetic  nitrogen.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:19):**  I think each of them, right, so that there's obviously the paradigm in this case is the  application of synthetic nitrogen.  So how do you, how do you move beyond that?  
**[0:44:28-0:44:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:28):**  There's many different ways you could envision it.  So sound is taking an approach of sort of developing essentially a bio based input that  can help the plants essentially recruit the microbes that are naturally present in the  
**[0:44:40-0:44:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:40):**  soil to fix nitrogen.  So that's a, that's a really interesting approach.  It sort of enables what's already there.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:46):**  And then the, you know, very interesting company, Andy's Agriculture, sort of in some ways,  a complimentary approach, but sort of, they basically have a way of loading microbes onto  a seed in a really efficient way that allows for very high colonization rates that once  
**[0:45:01-0:45:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:01):**  again sort of allows for natural microbes that are found in the soil.  Although in this case, they're pretreated on the seed to go on, precolonize the plant  essentially by being loaded at really high levels into the seed.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:12):**  But I just use that to illustrate there's many different ways of solving this challenge.  And I don't think a one size fits all approach will work across the globe.  One of the other things we talked about was digital agriculture and the difficulties we've  
**[0:45:24-0:45:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:24):**  seen in that sort of taking off are, you know, adoption challenges, returns challenges.  How are you seeing the digital ag space?  Is it getting more traction than a couple of years ago?  
**[0:45:37-0:45:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:37):**  That's been a challenging place for, for companies to scale, to, to really scale to, you know,  tens or hundreds of millions of acres, which is the scale of agriculture.  I think there's probably many reasons for the challenges, but I heard a colleague describe  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:50):**  it well recently, which is distinguishing between features and solutions.  And I think that's been one of the challenges and it's maybe not to criticize the development  of features because that's sort of the essence of a product, like the first stage, but the  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:04):**  challenge has been the growers and the market is looking for this, you know, sort of the  whole solution.  And often it's not a one-off feature or even two that will solve a problem, especially  
**[0:46:15-0:46:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:15):**  in sort of a complicated set of activities like agriculture.  So I think, I don't know, I thought that was a really helpful distinction and sort of helps  diagnose part of the challenges and digital technologies gaining more traction.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:26):**  But one area, you know, I think the thing that's different now compared to a couple  of years ago, I think, you know, everyone was focused on yield, which is good, but it's  also, it's an area of declining marginal returns, I guess, if you're going after, you know,  
**[0:46:38-0:46:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:38):**  additional bushels per acre, I think there are other areas to look at.  And certainly a lot of people have realized this, but especially with the advent of carbon  marketplaces and the potential for growers to capture value through storing carbon or  
**[0:46:51-0:46:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:51):**  utilizing less greenhouse gases in their practices, opened up a whole new value stream for agriculture.  But then that obviously is going to take a lot of different technology, which doesn't  involve traditional agricultural inputs.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:04):**  And that technology does not yet exist.  So if you just sort of look at the market size there of a couple hundred million acres  and a couple of 10, 10 to a hundred dollars per acre, depending on how much carbon can  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:15):**  be stored, it's a pretty large market that really there's, that technology is really  in its infancy there.  That's something we've certainly seen in making this podcast, that there's a ton of interest  
**[0:47:24-0:47:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:24):**  and excitement, maybe even hype and skepticism around soil carbon.  It's one of the most popular topics we've had on the podcast.  It sounds like you're sort of bullish on this as an opportunity.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:35):**  I think so as a, as a market, there's obviously so many questions, but that's always true  of new markets, I think.  But you start to get into carbon storage and thinking about what does that mean and how  
**[0:47:45-0:47:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:45):**  does it work on agricultural land?  And it's, it's sort of difficult, right?  Because you're, you have to think about timescale and organic carbon and its life cycle throughout  
**[0:47:54-0:47:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:54):**  in the geochemistry of the soil.  Like it's very complicated, very fast.  And I don't think the science is quite up to being able to track that all.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:02):**  So then it gets a question of sort of how, how effective in some ways are those carbon  credits?  And what's on that versus greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, maybe nitrogen application  
**[0:48:12-0:48:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:12):**  and decarbonizing the inputs going into agriculture.  So there's so many different ways it can go, but yeah, I think it's sort of a greenfield,  no pun intended for, for agriculture.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:21):**  It's a totally new value stream growth area for the industry as a, frankly, as it may  be as a scientist or as an investor, it's, it's interesting also, cause there's just  so many different technologies or capabilities that could be applied to the space from digital  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:34):**  to inputs, to looking at how you produce nitrogen to sort of how the plants are grown.  So there's just so many different angles to pursue.  I find that very exciting.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:43):**  A hundred percent, no shortage of areas to look at in this space, kind of changing gears  a little bit, Derek, how do you see corporate venture arms like, like leaps by bear fitting  in with the broader ag industry or kind of big ag.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:55):**  And I guess where my head's going is, you know, some of the big chem and seed companies  didn't have amazing reputations 10, 20, whatever years ago.  And there's still social license challenges around big ag today.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:07):**  Is that changing?  And how do you see kind of ventures role in, in changing and shaping this, this conversation?  That's a good point on the social license, but I also say, you know, if you really want  
**[0:49:18-0:49:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:18):**  to have a huge effect, positive effect on the world, companies like Bayer that have  a massive footprint you know, Corteva Syngenta and other, you know, essentially since any  large companies actually are huge levers for change in a positive sense.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:34):**  And frankly, that's where they want to go, right?  They may not be there today, but they know for the sustainability of their own business.  You know, you look at what is, what is Bayer's or Syngenta's or Corteva's business model  
**[0:49:44-0:49:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:44):**  look like in 20 or 30 years, it will be very different.  And the kinds of solutions it sells or offers will be very, very different.  So I see, you know, I see corporate venture and this particular leaps by Bayer is sort  
**[0:49:57-0:50:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:57):**  of a bridge to help Bayer get from, from here to there, you know, taking advantage of paradigm  shifting sort of breakthrough technologies that can solve problems for new markets.  It sort of helps provide a stepping stone for, for a large corporation like this company  
**[0:50:12-0:50:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:12):**  to evolve into a different kind of business as the needs of society change over time.  Otherwise, you know, society will leave in some ways, leave the companies behind.  So I think that's a key role of corporate venture capital.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:24):**  It's not just insight into the future, but it's sort of strategically sort of setting  up the company to, to be able to make the moves necessary to, to evolve its own business.  And I just want to reiterate the point.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:35):**  I mean, I think companies like this with such a large footprint in the environment are actually  great levers for change.  So you think about nitrogen fixation and if you could offer even just through breeding,  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:45):**  for example, like marginally offer a plant that's you know, maybe a few pounds less of  nitrogen per acre that would just have a fairly large effect, right?  It's a thin effect, but spread out over a large acreage would, would be a pretty, pretty  
**[0:50:58-0:50:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:58):**  big change for the world.  It's really interesting to say that.  I mean, I think I've told you this before, my personal journey into ag was through like  
**[0:51:05-0:51:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:05):**  small organic, you know, vegetable production in a developing country.  And I came at this like, you know, Monsanto is evil, these big companies, you know, watching  all the documentaries and have ended up in a wait, timeout.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:16):**  If we want to really change the system, these companies don't want to do anything that's  bad for the world.  There's a lot of smart, well, many people in there.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:22):**  And by the way, if they do something and make a small change, you can turn that ship.  You can really change the world.  So that, that very much echoes my personal journey.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:29):**  And to your point before the kind of talent that wants to come into this space now and  the opportunities at a big company, you know, a startup might only be hiring five or 10  people, 15 people, 20 people a year, the kind of scale at which we can get smart people  
**[0:51:41-0:51:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:41):**  into this industry is, is unparalleled with big companies.  When you look at ag tech and ag and kind of the next five years, what's most exciting  for you?  
**[0:51:51-0:51:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:51):**  What's really going to move the needle?  One thing I have been thinking about recently, you know, synthetic biology, buzzword, it's  more than a buzzword, right?  
**[0:51:58-0:52:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:58):**  It's a whole bio revolution that's happening.  Just a combination of confluence of so many trends and discovery.  So truly the pace of life science discovery, I'd say is at least an order of magnitude  
**[0:52:10-0:52:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:10):**  higher than 10 years ago or 20 years ago.  And that's because of access to obviously to genomics, you can sequence individual plants  or humans and really get a massive amount of data that gives you a lot of scientific  
**[0:52:21-0:52:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:21):**  insight.  We obviously want to engineer living systems, I think to help solve some of the greatest  challenges in the world, but a lot of that is being applied to microbes because it's  
**[0:52:29-0:52:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:29):**  easy, right?  I mean, it's easy to, to, to transform E. coli and manipulate them.  And we're learning a lot about their metabolic systems.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:36):**  Plants are much harder, right?  If you compare, like I would say like the synthetic biology of plants is still more  or less in the dark ages compared to where we're at with microbes.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:44):**  So that's just sort of a problem I'm thinking about.  No solutions are obvious or apparent today, but if you sort of break down the problem  of why, why can't you do all of these things you do for sort of high throughput engineering  
**[0:52:56-0:52:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:56):**  and microbes, how can you do that on plants?  I think is sort of an interesting question to think about.  Some great points there.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:03):**  You know, I think what has been so good about making this podcast is being able to follow  the journeys of innovators who come from all different backgrounds and then just see where  they end up.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:13):**  And I have to say you, Sarah, have been on a bit of a journey of discovery with this  podcast.  Now I've only been with the team for a bit over a year.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:21):**  So I wanted to ask you, why did you want to start Ag Tech?  So what in the first place?  We glad you did.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:27):**  I've got a job out of it, but why did you want to start it?  Yes.  And I have to thank you too, because one of the things that's been so great for me about  
**[0:53:34-0:53:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:34):**  making this podcast is having you on board to help.  So thank you for all your work behind the scenes.  But I really started the podcast and we did as a company and a team because there were  
**[0:53:43-0:53:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:43):**  so many untold stories that I was hearing about and meeting people that are really just  sometimes non-traditional innovators or folks kind of flying under the radar that I just  thought were worth telling the stories of and kind of shouting them from the rooftops.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:57):**  And really then it gave me an excuse to talk to them and to share those stories with other  people.  Given I love podcasts and didn't want to do anything with video, I thought it was really  
**[0:54:04-0:54:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:04):**  a good chance to do that.  But we've come a long way, not just changing the name of the podcast, like you said, but  taking on a bunch of feedback from our listeners to hopefully improve, which we really appreciate.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:14):**  One big one was our audio quality.  Another big one has been our intro and of course our name over the years.  Well, as I promised earlier, I found some of the original intro.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:26):**  It's from four years ago.  It's the music.  Here it is.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:31):**  Hi, everyone.  In this episode of The So What of AgTech, we'll bring you interesting things from interesting  people and I'm one of your co-hosts, Simon Mathewson.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:43):**  And I'm your other co-host, Sarah Nolet.  On this podcast, we will bring in leading speakers in technology, entrepreneurship,  investment, agriculture, science, and anything else you can think of and we can find in the  
**[0:54:54-0:54:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:54):**  world of ag tech.  We'll look to demystify it so that we're getting to the so what.  What does it really mean for farmers and for the broader agricultural industry?  
**[0:55:01-0:55:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:01):**  I'm farming and I grow it.  I'm farming and I grow it.  Sarah, it's all part of the iteration process you talk about.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:18):**  Yes.  Well, and part of iterating is failing and apparently being embarrassed.  So thank you for that, Kato.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:26):**  We also lost a bunch of, no, we also lost a bunch of the early episodes, but actually  I think maybe that's okay because the audio quality as our listeners constantly told us  was pretty crap.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:36):**  But really the best thing about the podcast is you, the listener.  And so we put a call out asking you to tell us about yourself, what ag tech you've tried  or what ag tech industry you're involved in and where you see the future of this industry  
**[0:55:48-0:55:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:48):**  going.  And this is what you said.  Jonathan Zettler with Fieldwalker Agronomy in Ontario, Canada, and really enjoyed the  
**[0:55:58-0:56:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:58):**  Ag Tech So What podcast mainly because you get your listeners like myself to ask better  questions as we try and explore this space.  And for myself this year, looking for remote sensing technology within this agronomy business,  
**[0:56:17-0:56:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:17):**  and it's enabled me to invest a percentage of our revenue and maybe take some calculated  risks to try and identify that.  But the podcasts that I've enjoyed the most focus on how to properly frame the problem  
**[0:56:30-0:56:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:30):**  and then look for solutions that address that and keep up the great work.  Really enjoy it.  Thanks.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:37):**  Hey guys.  Hey, my name is Marek.  I'm a founder of a small startup based in Brisbane called Terano.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:44):**  We are makers of long range soil moisture sensors.  So obviously the irrigation topic that you recorded was of particular interest to me.  And I can't agree more with what you described as the psychology of the farmers that's basically  
**[0:57:00-0:57:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:00):**  stopping the adoption of those new technologies.  We'll be trying to approach them in exactly that way.  So instead of trying to focus on technology and how good our devices are, we're basically  
**[0:57:14-0:57:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:14):**  looking at solving the problems and just proving that we have something that they will potentially  need and it will make an impact, measurable impact on something they own.  So thanks again guys.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:30):**  Keep up the good work.  Hello, this is Nick Seymour from Farmo.  We are an Australian ag tech company trying to solve problems on the ground for producers  
**[0:57:40-0:57:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:40):**  with ag tech.  The question posed in this podcast is where is ag tech going in the future?  In our opinion, it's going exactly where you want it to go.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:49):**  Ag tech is simply another tool in your toolkit to save you time and save you money when you  think you could be better off doing other things.  For instance, if you're like me and you hate getting a call from the Cavendish cop to tell  
**[0:58:02-0:58:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:58:02):**  you you've got cattle on the road because the solar energizer has gone down after a  few cloudy days, well, you can get some ag tech that's going to send a message to your  phone whenever the voltage drops on your electric fence line.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:58:17):**  One thing we haven't been able to do is invent a time machine, which is unfortunate because  one of the worst things we have to do in the agriculture industry is just drive these long  distances with hours and hours of boring miles in the car.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:58:33):**  And for that, we are very thankful for the technology of podcasts.  And today we're celebrating the ag tech, so what podcast reaching a hundred episodes,  which is an enormous achievement and so well done.  
**[0:58:48-0:58:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:58:48):**  It makes our driving these long distances just that little bit easier.  So great.  Thank you, Nick, Merrick and Jonathan for those messages.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:58:59):**  We so appreciate you taking the time to do that.  And Kirsten, thanks for joining and for embarrassing me.  And again, for all the hard work you do to make Ag Tech, so what possible.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:59:08):**  My pleasure.  And a big thank you to our guests, Mark Wooten, Stu Austin, Sarah Mauch and Derek Norman.  And of course, thank you for listening.

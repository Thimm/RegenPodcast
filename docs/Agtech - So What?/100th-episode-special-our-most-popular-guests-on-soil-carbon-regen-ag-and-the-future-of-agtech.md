**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to a very special episode of Ag Tech So What brought to you by the Ag  
**[0:00:07-0:00:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:07):**  Fenty Group.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:08):**  I'm Sarah Nolette.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:09):**  We're very pleased to say that this is our 100th episode and what a journey it's been  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:14):**  from idea to what I genuinely feel has become a global ag tech community.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:19):**  So for this episode, we're doing something different.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:21):**  We're going to hear from you, our listeners, about the future of the ag tech industry.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:25):**  We'll also hear from some of our most popular guests about what they've been up to and where  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:30):**  the future of the ag tech industry, in particular regenerative ag and soil carbon, is headed.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:36):**  Because while this podcast has grown, so too has the entire space.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:40):**  And that's what it's all about ultimately.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:42):**  Every conversation and story is about trying to move the needle.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:45):**  So have we?  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:48):**  My bullshit antennas even got even higher and at an even more attune than it was.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:53):**  As soon as I hear someone talking about mother nature, my antenna just starts to sparkle  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:00:58):**  up and I'm going, oh my God, what's coming behind this is something a bit dangerous.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:04):**  That is the thing that is becoming transformative is that people are striding into supply chains,  
**[0:01:11-0:01:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:11):**  striding into retail, striding into seed or chemical or these other big places and saying,  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:17):**  I'm smart and capable and an asset to this company and I'm going to hold them accountable  
**[0:01:22-0:01:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:22):**  to doing better.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:23):**  And to me, that's a super hopeful story.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:27):**  You just heard from Sarah Mock, agriculture journalist and author.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:30):**  And before that, Mark Wooten, known in Australia as the carbon neutral farmer.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:35):**  We'll be checking in on what's happened since we last spoke to them and where they think  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:39):**  ag tech is headed.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:40):**  We'll also hear from Stuart Austin from Wilmot Cattle Company, which has recently been in  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:44):**  the news for selling carbon credits to Microsoft.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:47):**  And we get an update from Derek Norman, VP of venture investments at Leaps by Bayer.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:53):**  I couldn't do all of this alone today or any other day.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:01:56):**  So it seems fitting to also bring in our producer Kirsten, or as we call her, Kdips.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:03):**  So where should we start Kdips?  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:04):**  Hey, happy 100th Sarah.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:07):**  Oh, that makes me feel old.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:10):**  You're not old, but you've been here from the beginning, which it's been a few years,  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:15):**  I think, since you began maybe four or five.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:18):**  And I'd actually like to ask you about the early days of the podcast later, just because  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:23):**  you're always talking about iterating.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:25):**  So I think 100 episodes is a pretty decent milestone.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:28):**  And I also thought it might be fun to pull out one of your early iterations.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:32):**  Oh, do we have to?  
**[0:02:34-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:34):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:37):**  There's an interesting intro that I think will be fun to play.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:40):**  The pod even had a different name when you started.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:42):**  Yes.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:43):**  It was called Bush Tech.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:44):**  Ah, yeah.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:45):**  Okay.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:46):**  But it was the intro music.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:47):**  I think that was absolute gold and we're going to share it at the end of the episode.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:51):**  Great.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:52):**  Well, looking forward to that.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:54):**  In the meantime, let's bring in Mark Wooten.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:02:57):**  He is a mixed farmer in Hamilton, Victoria, who has really been a pioneer for carbon neutral  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:02):**  farming, which is why his comments on regenerative ag last year on the podcast were so surprising.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:08):**  Well, I'm an atheist when it comes to regen ag.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:11):**  I think that that is an evangelical movement and I think that they need to come up with  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:17):**  the science and they keep coming and I keep saying, send me the science that shows me  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:21):**  peer reviewed science that shows me the outcome and not one of them has produced it yet.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:26):**  Not one.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:28):**  So what's changed?  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:29):**  Has he been sent the science?  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:31):**  I caught up with Mark to find out.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:33):**  Well, just on a practical level on the farm, we've had quite good seasons compared to other  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:38):**  parts of the world and we're producing and we've got probably record protein prices for  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:44):**  both most of our meat products.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:46):**  So lamb, mutton and beef.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:48):**  On another level, I've joined on the deputy chair of Victorian Agricultural Climate Change  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:53):**  Council, which is a state government based organisation.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:03:57):**  And we are looking across the whole ag sector in Victoria and trying to identify potential  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:02):**  issues coming up, but more importantly, in terms of climate change opportunities.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:06):**  And what's the conversation like in terms of climate advocacy?  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:09):**  Like I guess my sense is there's been a bit of a tipping point.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:12):**  I don't know if it's Covid and people have been doing more navel gazing or bushfires.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:16):**  Do you feel like things are accelerating?  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:20):**  I feel like on an individual, on a community, on a corporate basis, it definitely is moving.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:26):**  The recent IPCC report that just came out has just highlighted the fact that we're going  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:31):**  to get to where we didn't want to get to about 10 years earlier.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:36):**  That's just in broad language.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:37):**  We're going to hell in a handbasket and we need to actually start acting.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:41):**  So farmers are very, very attuned to risk and they're looking at this as an opportunity  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:48):**  to make sure that they minimise their risk.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:50):**  And it's a good space to be actually.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:52):**  I have very little debates about climate change and whether humans are causing it anymore.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:57):**  It's just virtually a non-topic.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:04:59):**  It's just, okay, let's not worry about that, but what can we do?  
**[0:05:02-0:05:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:02):**  It's all focused on future.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:03):**  That's super exciting.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:04):**  I mean, that's been my sense too, but I sometimes think I'm kind of preaching to the choir a  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:09):**  little bit.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:10):**  Are you seeing that around adoption of technology as well as people are less sceptical maybe  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:14):**  of climate and seeing this as a threat risk, but also an opportunity?  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:19):**  I think it's happening.

**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:27):**  energy reduction, which is a lot of it's about renewables and it's a $60 million program.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:33):**  So it's a useful one.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:34):**  It's oversubscribed and farmers have got to that point where they've got the neighbour  
**[0:05:38-0:05:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:38):**  or the case study up the road.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:40):**  They can go look at someone who's adopted, whether it's a more efficient irrigation pump  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:45):**  or they've moved into solar or they're looking at whatever the systems are they're operating  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:49):**  in and they're just taking it up.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:51):**  And it's a 50 50 scheme.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:52):**  So I have to put their half their own money in and the adoption in that it's just accelerating.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:57):**  Now they're going to run out of money again.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:05:59):**  So it's a good, it just shows you people are voting with their feet.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:04):**  Our view, and we covered this on the bonus podcast we've just put out and a blog we wrote,  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:09):**  the incentives don't fully align in terms of who benefits.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:11):**  And a lot of this will come from pull in the supply chain.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:14):**  If you've got a meat processor offering different grid prices for something that can prove certain  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:20):**  environmental outcomes, or if you've got incentives downstream in the supply chain to adopt technology  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:25):**  that makes you more efficient, et cetera, that can be another, I guess, leverage point,  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:29):**  not just kind of 50 50 matching from government.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:32):**  So hopefully we'll see more of those private sector and supply chain incentives coming  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:36):**  too.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:37):**  And I think that's the key.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:38):**  It can't be, it can't be, you know, the, the, the government can't involve themselves overly  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:44):**  in another actors lead, you know, and showed by example.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:47):**  And I think that, you know, you look at meat quality as an issue of purchasing, that's  
**[0:06:51-0:06:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:51):**  where it's happening.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:52):**  And that's what will happen.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:53):**  I think with the carbon footprint stuff and the meat processes of saying that the consumer  
**[0:06:57-0:06:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:57):**  wants to have eating quality.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:06:59):**  And so therefore they've set up the grid accordingly and the testing.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:02):**  So you can trace individual carcasses going through different plants and that's all just  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:07):**  taking off and people are going, Oh my God, I never realized that we could do this.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:12):**  And now there's momentum because people want to go and they, you know, you spending a lot  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:15):**  of money on a product.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:16):**  They want to have a guaranteed outcome when they put it into their own household situation.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:24):**  When you came on the podcast, Mark, I definitely don't think I expected this, but the episode  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:28):**  we did was one of the most popular episodes that we've ever done.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:31):**  Nothing against you, but I just wasn't sure how ready the market was for a focus on regenerative  
**[0:07:36-0:07:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:36):**  agriculture.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:37):**  And I was blown away by the response and your episode in particular, I think struck a chord  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:41):**  with people because of how you farm and who you are and your success and yet your skepticism  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:47):**  over the term regen.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:50):**  What was the response you received after coming on the podcast?  
**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:53):**  Did you get any feedback?  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:07:54):**  Well, if you were surprised Sarah, I was even more surprised because I had, there was a  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:00):**  climate chorus as I call them.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:02):**  They, they, they came forward and were very sympathetic and keen that we do things that  
**[0:08:08-0:08:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:08):**  we do.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:09):**  But I also had a number of anxious people.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:11):**  I'll put it that way, contacted me about some of the, that might have been a bit hard on  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:16):**  regen having to put some science behind their claims.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:20):**  And of those people who did contact me, if you did say they were going to send me data,  
**[0:08:24-0:08:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:24):**  and none have.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:25):**  So I'm still back where I was.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:28):**  There's a data vacuum in this spot.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:29):**  I've met my, to be crude with you, my bullshit antennas even got even higher and at an even  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:36):**  more attuned than it was.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:38):**  As soon as I hear someone talking about mother nature, my antenna just starts to sparkle  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:42):**  up and I'm going, oh my God, what's coming behind this is something a bit dangerous.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:48):**  And that doesn't mean I'm not looking at it critically.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:51):**  I mean, I'm not anti the concept of regenerative, that sort of like, it's a, you know, it's  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:57):**  a beautiful phrase.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:08:58):**  I just think it's been co-opted in different ways.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:01):**  I mean, it's, I think it's moved in a much more positive direction now though.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:05):**  I think there's a lot more data and people doing it.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:07):**  I think some of the cases that have come forward, unfortunately, like the Wilmon Ag where Microsoft  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:12):**  forwarded and stuff, unfortunately that seems to be a bit not properly verified.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:17):**  And there's, there's a whole scientific discussion going on about that.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:20):**  So I get papers on this as well.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:22):**  So I'm getting belted from all sides on it.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:24):**  The message I really would be like people to take home is that you're still better doing  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:30):**  something, even if it's not perfect than doing nothing.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:33):**  And that's why I would still, even with my bullshit antenna, very heightened, I still  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:39):**  would rather than be working in this space than going back and doing nothing.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:42):**  So I don't, I don't want to be as negative as perhaps I was in that podcast.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:47):**  Sarah, I feel like at this point, it would be really good to bring in Stuart Austin.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:51):**  He's the general manager of Wilmot Cattle Company, who Mark just actually mentioned  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:55):**  then.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:56):**  And you happen to also interview him for this podcast.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:09:59):**  Yes.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:00):**  Well, first I spoke to him back in 2019 and this year there's been some big news for Wilmot,  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:05):**  as I said before, where they announced that they're selling half a million dollars worth  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:09):**  of soil carbon credits to Microsoft in what was a pretty landmark deal.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:12):**  Yeah, it's huge.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:13):**  I mean, just to think a farm in New South Wales and granted, it's a very professional  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:19):**  operation.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:20):**  It's owned by the MacDoc group, but it means that farmers can actually sell carbon credits  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:25):**  to a company like Microsoft.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:28):**  It's a big deal.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:30):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:31):**  And that's where we started this conversation when I caught up again with Stu.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:34):**  There certainly has been a lot that's going on in the last couple of years.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:38):**  So it's been exciting.

**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:44):**  and kind of just some respects idling along waiting for the good times.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:49):**  And that all happened in January, February, 2020.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:53):**  Things changed considerably, started to rain and we really cranked things up and got back  
**[0:10:57-0:11:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:10:57):**  to business as usual, I suppose, in that 2020 year.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:04):**  And then towards the back end of 2020 was when things started to transpire around our  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:07):**  carbon credit deal.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:08):**  It was sort of all happening in the back end, I suppose.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:11):**  And then as you well know, early this year, that deal was announced through the Regen  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:16):**  Network with Microsoft.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:17):**  And so that led to the last, or the first six months of this year, my life was basically  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:22):**  consumed by soil carbon talking, a lot of talking and a lot of discussion and a lot  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:26):**  more talking, which was terrific.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:28):**  I mean, that was one of the big reasons we did that deal was, yes, there was a financial  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:31):**  gain in there for us, but it was also around the rubber hitting the road and someone getting  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:36):**  a deal done relating to soil carbon and the world recognising that soil carbon was a real  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:42):**  thing and very valuable and had a lot to offer in terms of opportunity for landholders, not  
**[0:11:47-0:11:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:47):**  only in Australia, but around the world.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:49):**  And how we need to consider integrating technology or the use of technology into soil carbon  
**[0:11:55-0:11:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:55):**  measurement.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:11:56):**  It was really exciting just to see how the whole conversation just escalated so dramatically  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:02):**  over the last six months in terms of, you know, now there's all kinds of players coming  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:06):**  into the market and all different fronts and people coming to market with different measurement  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:12):**  and modelling methods using technology.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:14):**  And I think it's just fantastic.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:15):**  Yeah, it's kind of one thing to be first, like the expression that comes to mind is  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:19):**  you want to be on the leading edge, not the bleeding edge.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:22):**  But some might argue that you're on the bleeding edge for some of this stuff in kind of an  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:26):**  experimental field.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:28):**  What do you say when others ask you, you know, is it ready?  
**[0:12:31-0:12:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:31):**  Should they get involved?  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:32):**  Can other farmers sell credits to Microsoft?  
**[0:12:35-0:12:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:35):**  Yeah, look, it is.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:38):**  And we do, I suppose, deflect to the ERF model as being, you know, when people are at the  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:43):**  start of the journey and there's a thought there in terms of the grazing management journey.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:47):**  So they just that practice time is just starting.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:51):**  You know, we say the best thing for you to do is yes, to talk to one of the carbon developers,  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:12:56):**  project developers and see, get them to do that desktop analysis and study and scoping  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:00):**  analysis on your farm, because every farm is different and see what opportunity there  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:04):**  might be, because once you start on the grazing management journey, then that's when the upside  
**[0:13:09-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:09):**  starts.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:10):**  So the more of that upside you can capture and the sooner you can start the project,  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:14):**  the sooner you'll be able to capture that upside.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:16):**  So that existing model is already there.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:18):**  What we did, yes, was the first, it was the first that Regen had ever done.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:21):**  It was the first soil carbon credit Microsoft had ever bought.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:24):**  It was the first significant soil carbon credit that had been traded at scale.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:29):**  In some respects, it's not necessarily a downside, but the downside to us now is that we're locked  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:33):**  into that.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:34):**  We're committed to that methodology, that program with the Regen network.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:39):**  You know, there's a whole bunch of complexities around the fact that even though we registered  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:43):**  these two farms for under the ERF model, now that we've sold carbon off these farms under  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:47):**  a different model, they have to be removed from that ERF project for a whole bunch of  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:52):**  different reasons.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:53):**  So in some respects, we've kind of tied our hands a bit, but on the plus side, it just  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:13:57):**  means that we work really closely with the Regen network to continue to improve the rigour  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:02):**  and the accuracy and the integrity of their methodology.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:05):**  Which means bringing in other technology, other models, et cetera, whatever we can get  
**[0:14:10-0:14:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:10):**  our hands on.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:11):**  One of the things you said is that you've now become a pretty hot commodity in terms  
**[0:14:15-0:14:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:15):**  of speaking about this stuff and getting asked to share your journey.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:18):**  What's that been like for you?  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:20):**  Do you ever feel like you're doing more talking than farming and do you like talking?  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:26):**  I think you're doing pretty well now, Sarah.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:28):**  I don't mind a yarn.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:30):**  I'm very passionate about sharing our story.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:32):**  And yes, by default, I've become kind of a MacBook ad group spokesperson, but I don't  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:38):**  know, I suppose I do it reasonably well and I do really enjoy it.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:43):**  And I really enjoy the fact that it helps other people, you know, when the messages  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:47):**  that I get or the phone calls that I get, you know, Stu can always have you only about  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:49):**  this.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:50):**  And I've got all the time in the world to do that because we don't do that enough as  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:53):**  an industry.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:54):**  We don't pick up the phone and ask him out for, you know, for some info or some help  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:58):**  or advice.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:14:59):**  So, yeah, it's been great.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:02):**  And as we've said all along, this is an additional revenue stream.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:05):**  We're not stopping food production and starting carbon production.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:09):**  We're continuing food production that carbon is still in our soil on this farm.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:14):**  We have just a major corporate business that needs to offset their emissions.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:17):**  As I said, we really like that story and the fact that you are taking that carbon out of  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:20):**  the atmosphere and we'd like to buy that credit from you.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:23):**  So we still get all the benefits from the carbon in our soil.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:25):**  So that's been a real positive.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:27):**  I think, you know, it was only in the last couple of months, I suppose, that that evolved.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:34):**  Back when you came on the podcast in 2019, we did talk about regenerative agriculture  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:38):**  and the kind of stigma that exists or existed and how it was moving, I guess, from witchcraft  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:44):**  to solid business practices.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:46):**  I guess does that stigma still exist?  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:48):**  No, I think the momentum is continuing to grow and particularly coming out of the drought,  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:54):**  there was a huge increase in interest, I suppose.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:15:57):**  I've always said that one of the greatest catalyst for change is pain.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:02):**  You know, you read anyone's miracle story, it was a bloody life threatening event that

**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:09):**  And so that's what happened to a bloody big portion of the industry.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:11):**  They came out of the drought and I went, holy shit, I did not ever want to go through that  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:14):**  again.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:15):**  Tell me a different way.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:16):**  Tell me how you got through it without feeling like we did or ending up like we did.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:20):**  So it has been fantastic.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:22):**  Everyone's got such a broad spectrum of theories around regenerative agriculture, what it is,  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:27):**  what it means, how you do it, practices versus principles, etc., etc.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:30):**  But certainly I think the recognition is growing as to how important it is that we focus on  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:36):**  soil health from a biological perspective.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:38):**  Yes, the carbon piece has certainly added some weight to that.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:41):**  People are kind of putting the two and two together a bit now.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:44):**  That's one thing that regen ag skeptics want to see is where's the data, where's the science  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:50):**  and what can you really point to in this space?  
**[0:16:53-0:16:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:53):**  How do you answer that question?  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:54):**  We've got it all and I'm more than willing to show people that, demonstrate that.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:16:59):**  There's certainly not much of our business that we haven't put out in the public forum.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:05):**  And the other thing that I try really hard not to do is create that really confrontational  
**[0:17:09-0:17:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:09):**  discussion around regen ag.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:11):**  Here's what we do.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:13):**  We're sharing this to help other people.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:14):**  Take it or leave it.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:15):**  I don't mind if you don't believe in it.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:16):**  That's fine.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:17):**  All the best.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:18):**  I'm surrounded by people who are, and I just don't get in those polarizing discussions.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:23):**  And when I do, I say, that's okay.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:25):**  No dramas.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:26):**  That's fine.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:27):**  You continue to manage the way you do that.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:28):**  I've got no qualms with that.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:29):**  And it comes back to you can't help those who don't want to be helped and people aren't  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:34):**  interested, but that's fine.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:36):**  You talked a little bit about it last time when you came on the podcast in terms of using  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:39):**  grazing management software with my grazing, any other tech that you've been using to collect  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:43):**  that data and do that, make sure it is rigorous.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:46):**  Well, the regen network stuff, that was all Sentinel imagery stuff that I still don't  
**[0:17:52-0:17:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:52):**  fully understand, but do to some extent.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:54):**  And we probably built on that, I suppose, with FarmLab with Sam Duncan.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:17:58):**  We've just started to use his platform, plugging all our data.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:01):**  We've got so much data, particularly soil data now, and it started to be measured by  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:07):**  Carbon Link and RCS took some samples.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:09):**  And so we've got all these soil samples and it has to this point been housed in a real  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:14):**  big beast of a spreadsheet of bats that can do all sorts of great things.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:18):**  And he can drive it and I can drive it and not many others can.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:21):**  But all that other data that we've also been collecting on, I wanted to put it in one place  
**[0:18:26-0:18:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:26):**  and then expand on that with some of that mapping capability.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:29):**  And that's what I think is exciting is being able to extrapolate data analysis out across  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:33):**  the whole farm using some of those different satellite imagery tools.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:38):**  You mentioned before that you're sort of being seen as a carbon farmer now, is there any  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:44):**  downside to being seen as a carbon farmer when again, that's just one aspect of your  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:48):**  business, as you said before, you're still producing food and even carbon is not your  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:52):**  main commodity?  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:53):**  Yep, it's interesting.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:18:54):**  One of the I've got somewhat of a template for a presentation nowadays and that is one  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:01):**  line in there is that we don't call ourselves carbon farmers.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:04):**  You know, our guys get out of bed every day to think about how they can grow more grass,  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:07):**  produce more kilos of beef and make more money from beef production.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:11):**  That's their primary focus.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:13):**  And that's why we always talk about this, the carbon credit as an additional revenue  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:17):**  stream and a kind of co-benefit of our beef production business.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:20):**  So yeah, plenty of people call us carbon farmers.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:23):**  I suppose that's where we, like I said earlier, where we're kind of building a bit of an understanding  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:29):**  of the difference between what we've done versus what, say guys in Western New South  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:34):**  or Western Queensland are doing with human induced reveg projects or those other sort  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:38):**  of carbon methodologies that are, that's where the majority of acues have been generated  
**[0:19:42-0:19:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:42):**  to this point.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:44):**  And for the most part, those guys are making more money from carbon than they are from  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:47):**  protein production, I suppose, where we're sort of saying, no, no, our production business  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:51):**  is still as it was.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:53):**  We're also relying on top of that an additional revenue stream through soil carbon credit.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:19:58):**  Well there's more than one way to skin a cat when it comes to carbon.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:02):**  Yeah, it's such an early field, but super exciting.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:05):**  And both Stuart and Mark Wooten are pioneers in what they're doing.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:08):**  While they do have a different approach, I'd say they probably have more similarities than  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:12):**  they do differences.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:13):**  Yeah, I'd agree with that.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:15):**  And they've really started a conversation that's just become more mainstream, certainly  
**[0:20:19-0:20:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:19):**  within Australia and beyond.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:21):**  I mean, after our podcast with Mark Wooten, he then appeared on a documentary done by  
**[0:20:27-0:20:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:27):**  the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:29):**  It was called Fight for Planet A.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:30):**  Yeah, so I actually asked him about this and he received an interesting response from the  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:36):**  public.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:37):**  Well, I foolishly said on that show, if you want to have a guilt free steak, we'll sell  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:44):**  you one.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:45):**  And we had a litany of very well-meaning, very thoughtful consumers that must have found  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:53):**  our web page and then wrote to us saying, where did we get a steak from you?  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:20:58):**  And we had to write back and say, that's not how we do it.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:02):**  This is not the scalable.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:03):**  But again, I'm hoping that I'm wrong on that.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:06):**  And in the future, we can.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:07):**  The supply chain and exactly what you're touching on before actually allows for market differentiation

**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:20):**  And we're getting rewarded accordingly.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:22):**  And hopefully the retailer gets rewarded accordingly too.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:27):**  And that's where we've got to make sure that we do it.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:30):**  Interestingly enough, going back to the Wilmont example, one of the key things that's happened  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:34):**  since that for me going forward is putting aside the whole debate about regen and verification  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:40):**  and permanence, which is a debate within.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:43):**  Let's just put all that to one side for the moment.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:45):**  I think farmers need to critically think about whether they are going to sell their carbon  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:49):**  credits to third party or they're going to keep them for their own product, particularly  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:54):**  at lower rates.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:55):**  I think that is a really commercial decision they have to focus on.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:21:58):**  And for some, it's a logical thing that they do it now.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:02):**  And for others like us, we're not selling.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:04):**  We're keeping it as we will not be able to say we have a carbon neutral product if we  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:09):**  sell them off to third parties to offset their own emissions.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:13):**  I mean, there's a big question there around I mean, the input companies now want to claim  
**[0:22:17-0:22:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:17):**  these offsets and do that through the farmers they supply.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:19):**  The downstream companies want to do it through the farmers they procure from.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:23):**  The farmers are going to have to claim some kind of carbon neutrality and like, you know,  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:27):**  there's only so many credits to go around.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:29):**  And then to your point about all the other risks, I'm not at all advocating for doing  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:32):**  nothing, but like you said, sort of thinking about this space and the evolution versus  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:36):**  maybe some of the people coming knocking on the door saying you can make a quick buck.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:40):**  It's pretty challenging to actually make a decision.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:43):**  And where do you draw the line?  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:45):**  We say our line is at our farm gate when the product leaves, because that's where our control  
**[0:22:49-0:22:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:49):**  ends.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:50):**  And that's the sheep's sustainability framework, which comes out as worked on that from an  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:54):**  animal welfare perspective.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:22:56):**  It's worked on that from a carbon, it's worked on it from an environmental point of view.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:00):**  That's the line, because then each the parties transport or the processes or the retail and  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:06):**  have to be responsible for their own element.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:08):**  That's a complicated story to say to consumers though.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:11):**  But people are getting their head around this, that if you do sell off your carbon credits  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:17):**  now to third parties, you can't sell it.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:18):**  It's barley, you can only sell your barley once, you can't sell it twice.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:22):**  And that's the analogy I use.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:25):**  The other thing, which is quite critical going forward in terms of farmers is that they need  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:30):**  to be conscious that as they get better at their production system and they lower their  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:35):**  footprint, maybe to carbon positive, they can sell some to third parties, but they need  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:41):**  to have better measurement within their own systems.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:44):**  And that's really challenging because of the vagaries of, the biggest thing with the carbon  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:49):**  soil change is predominantly you can really match it on rainfall levels.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:53):**  So those who have had good years, all of a sudden their carbon changes dramatically.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:23:57):**  And so it's terrifying because the market, the market know this and then consumers know  
**[0:24:03-0:24:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:03):**  that the risk is they'll go, this is all too hard.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:06):**  I'm not doing any of it because they're all crooks and we'll all be painted with the same  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:10):**  brush.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:11):**  And that's one of the reasons I'm probably quite critical of parties that are involved.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:14):**  It's my credibility could be attacked as being a farmer in general, if some farmers do dodgies  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:20):**  on the side.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:21):**  Yeah, I think that's right.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:22):**  We've talked about a few solutions.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:23):**  So technology, kind of supply chain incentives, government, what else needs to change in the  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:29):**  conversation in Australia or globally around ag and climate change?  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:33):**  Well, I think I still think the consumer has a really powerful position to play.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:39):**  If they demand of the retailer that they want this product, which is certified verifiable  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:45):**  going forward, then I think you'll find that you will have more that demand will drag it  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:51):**  through the system.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:52):**  People respond to price signals.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:54):**  They do.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:55):**  I mean, we won't be any different if there's a price signal.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:24:57):**  We've signed up with ZQ, the New Zealand bull brand, which is mainly based on the sportswear  
**[0:25:02-0:25:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:02):**  market, icebreaker and that type of product.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:04):**  And they've now got an RX part of it, which is regen and carbon side on it.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:09):**  And we've got that.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:10):**  And they're going to use our own brand to talk about our biodiversity and that whole  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:14):**  enviro story we've got, which is probably a significant, probably more significant to  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:19):**  us than the carbon side, to be honest with you.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:21):**  We just planted here physically.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:23):**  We just planted just over 24,000 trees into these linkages plantations just in the last  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:28):**  month.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:29):**  And as soon as you get people engaged in this space, they start my children and my, you  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:33):**  know, all of their friends all came out and volunteered in their own, their twenties.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:37):**  They wanted to actively be involved in solutions.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:41):**  There's a lot of goodwill in this space and we just need to make sure to give people hope.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:46):**  We don't want to just say the IPC reports, you know, we're heading to hell on a handbasket,  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:50):**  but you can't do anything about it.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:52):**  I mean, why would we keep doing what we're doing?  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:54):**  Why would you keep doing what you do?  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:25:56):**  I do love a philosophical question, Sarah, because that's often what it comes down to.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:02):**  And one guest we had last year, I think really spent her entire career asking, why am I doing  
**[0:26:08-0:26:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:08):**  what I'm doing?  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:09):**  Yes, Sarah Mock, who grew up on a farm in Wyoming.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:13):**  She's worked for some high profile ag tech startups like Farmers Business Network, but  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:17):**  has really made a name for herself as an ag journalist and an author with some pretty  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:21):**  provocative but well thought out perspectives.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:25):**  And the thing about Sarah Mock is like her whole reason for writing is led by a mission  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:30):**  to find out what's actually working in ag, what's making a difference, what's breaking  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:34):**  down some of those traditional barriers and just simply what is a good farm.

**[0:26:44-0:26:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:44):**  about ruffling any feathers.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:46):**  But like you said, in a thought out way.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:48):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:49):**  She's not afraid to make a statement and not afraid to back them up and, you know, genuinely  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:53):**  wants to move the conversation forward, all of which is pretty rare in this space.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:26:58):**  Since we last spoke to her, she's actually released a book called Farm and Other F-words,  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:02):**  which is all about what makes a small family farm work or not work so well.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:07):**  That's where I began my conversation with Sarah asking her how the book release went.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:12):**  It went amazing.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:13):**  I mean, I did a pre-release where I raised some funds to get to do the launch before,  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:19):**  you know, six months or so before I actually published and got a ton of support, which  
**[0:27:23-0:27:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:23):**  was very shocking and surprising to me.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:25):**  I'm still, I still live in the world day to day where I assume that it's mostly just my  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:28):**  parents reading everything I write.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:31):**  And when actual real people in the world show up to read it, it's very exciting.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:34):**  Well, congratulations.

**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:38):**  What's, what's something that's happened as a result of writing the book that you're excited  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:41):**  about?  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:43):**  I mean, so many people have just like reached out to me and wanted to chat more about what  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:48):**  they're working on, or I get asked a lot how farmers respond and react to the book because  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:54):**  there are some hot takes, I will say within its pages.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:27:58):**  And you know, the thing is I've been really surprised and excited to hear that a lot of  
**[0:28:02-0:28:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:02):**  farmers have actually been like, thank goodness that this book was written because I appreciate  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:08):**  this perspective a lot.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:09):**  And like, this is a part there's so much basically like weird patriotic, like jargon in the industry  
**[0:28:17-0:28:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:17):**  and not enough of talking about just like, yeah, but it's not just about being tough  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:24):**  and this being like a legacy business and it being about like feeding the world.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:29):**  It's also a business and it's also entrepreneurship and it's also tough and like all these other  
**[0:28:33-0:28:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:33):**  ways.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:34):**  And I think, you know, people in the book, people adjacent to the book read it and were  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:39):**  like, Oh my gosh, I feel so seen and validated.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:43):**  And that has been really great.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:45):**  And yeah, like they're more than just a symbol.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:50):**  I so appreciated the exploration of all the different kinds of farms.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:55):**  And I feel like it probably just cause it echoed a bit of my personal journey and like,  
**[0:28:59-0:29:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:28:59):**  what is a farm?  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:00):**  What is a good farm?  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:01):**  How do we think about these different farms?  
**[0:29:03-0:29:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:03):**  And I could sort of visualize you, like, I'm sure it didn't actually happen in the linear  
**[0:29:06-0:29:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:06):**  way that it sort of unfolds in each chapter.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:08):**  I mean, it sounds like a quest that many of us including yourself are kind of still on  
**[0:29:13-0:29:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:13):**  to figure out like, I mean, people talk about farmers.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:16):**  There's no one kind of farmer.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:17):**  There are many kinds of farms and our view of what a good farm is and can be is shifting.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:23):**  Has your view, like, where are you up to on your view of farms and good farms and big  
**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:28):**  farm team?  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:29):**  Oh man, that is such a hard question, especially as I get into working on the second half of  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:35):**  this book, that's going to come out in late spring 2022.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:39):**  You know, it was fun.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:40):**  I was just talking the other day about how I, the only reason I started doing journalism  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:43):**  and was basically because I had worked in the ag industry for a couple of years and  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:48):**  I had really mixed feelings about the work I was doing and about whether or not it was  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:51):**  impactful, whether or not it was the best use of my skills and about where the most  
**[0:29:55-0:29:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:55):**  important work in agriculture is.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:29:57):**  And I got into journalism to try and actually pay rent while I tried to answer those questions.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:03):**  And five years later, I don't know that I have great answers yet.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:09):**  And that's kind of discouraging because I just, one, like things are shifting really  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:13):**  fast and people like new ideas are coming up and being explored.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:17):**  Like the number of farms that have started and failed within the time that I have been  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:21):**  reporting on them is incredible and crazy and sad.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:26):**  And I have so many emotions about all of that.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:29):**  So where am I in my journey of what is a farm and what it looks like?  
**[0:30:32-0:30:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:32):**  I think I wrote the book and the big climax is just this idea of maybe farms could learn  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:40):**  some of the lessons that other places, entrepreneurial realms have learned.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:44):**  Things like your people are your most important asset or pursue profit, find opportunities,  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:50):**  that those kinds of ideas could be really transformative in agriculture and on farms  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:54):**  in particular.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:56):**  And in the second book, going out and trying to find people who are already putting those  
**[0:30:59-0:31:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:30:59):**  kind of big team farm ideas into practice, there's not that many, if there's any.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:07):**  People are doing parts of it.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:10):**  Different people are doing different parts and I think that's important.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:12):**  There's certainly people who are pursuing that kind of a really strong kind of human  
**[0:31:17-0:31:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:17):**  community or environmental ethic.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:19):**  There's certainly people who are out there working really hard to empower their employees  
**[0:31:22-0:31:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:22):**  and to make them part of their systems.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:23):**  And there's certainly people who are out there who are being economically successful, which  
**[0:31:28-0:31:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:28):**  I think is a really key piece.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:30):**  I haven't really found anyone or at least very few who are able to tie those three things  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:36):**  together.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:38):**  And I think that's been really important.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:40):**  It's been disappointing, I think, but also really important from a personal perspective  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:43):**  for me of just like people like me, I guess I'm like a bit of a theorist.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:47):**  And then also I think a lot of people who look to agriculture as a way to do social  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:51):**  impact work or a way to do social impact investing, want it to be all those things.  
**[0:31:56-0:31:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:56):**  And maybe it can't.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:31:58):**  Maybe it can't be all things to all people all the time.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:01):**  And maybe we need to have a really thoughtful conversation about what we give up when we  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:06):** ... What are the most important things and what might we actually be willing to give  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:10):**  up with or what might we be willing to pursue in a more limited way?  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:15):**  And yeah, I think that is not where I was when I had just finished writing the first  
**[0:32:19-0:32:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:19):**  book when I was like, no, big team farms are going to change everything and it's going

**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:23):**  It's totally fine.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:24):**  And I think I've at this point, having visited a bunch of farms that I had put in that category  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:29):**  before and had a lot of really tough conversations with folks, I'm in a little bit more of a  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:33):**  place of saying, paradigm shifts are hard, change is hard.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:37):**  It takes a lot of energy.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:38):**  And I think we have a long road ahead.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:40):**  Yes.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:41):**  And do you think we hold farms?  
**[0:32:43-0:32:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:43):**  I know this is a bigger question, but maybe quick comments to... And why if we do, like  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:50):**  different standards than other businesses, it strikes me there's lots of reasons we don't  
**[0:32:54-0:32:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:54):**  think of them as businesses in the traditional sense.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:56):**  And so we kind of hold them to a different standard.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:32:59):**  Totally.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:01):**  And I think that plays to their advantage and to their disadvantage at different times.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:05):**  I mean, I think part of it is just like the fact that there's such a strong interaction  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:09):**  with nature and impact on nature.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:10):**  I think that conversation gets really philosophical really fast of just like, maybe we can't harvest  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:16):**  food from nature without damaging it, even though we really want to not damage it.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:21):**  I think we also let farms off a lot on it.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:25):**  I think on the other side too, because of the way we've pastoralized and idealized farm  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:35):**  work, we also make a lot of exceptions for farm work, which it can be to farmer's advantage  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:39):**  a lot because we're like, oh, you don't need to be paid to do that.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:41):**  It's so fun.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:42):**  It's so easy.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:43):**  It's so natural.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:44):**  It's so human.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:45):**  But on the other side, it's also because of the economics of the farm system we've set  
**[0:33:48-0:33:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:48):**  up that assumed all of those first things, we've created a system where it's actually  
**[0:33:52-0:33:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:52):**  very hard to respectfully create work with dignity that pays people well, that also leads  
**[0:33:59-0:34:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:33:59):**  to a product that is affordable to people.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:02):**  And I think that is the third piece is, oh, how much food is allowed to cost is a whole  
**[0:34:09-0:34:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:09):**  part of this conversation.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:11):**  And that is a society-wide question for us about, is food a human right?  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:15):**  Should people be allowed to starve to death?  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:17):**  Or should food be something that we are entitled to?  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:21):**  But at the same time, in practice, a lot of times, because we realize those unrealistic  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:27):**  standards are there, we kind of just let farmers off the hook for everything because we're  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:31):**  just like, oh, we don't know where to put the bar with those super unrealistic standards.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:37):**  So we just put it down at like, are you a farmer?  
**[0:34:40-0:34:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:40):**  Then you must be good.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:41):**  Yes.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:42):**  I mean, the thing that comes to my head always is like good, fast, and cheap.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:46):**  And those aren't the three things that you're putting on the edge of those triangles, but  
**[0:34:49-0:34:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:49):**  you can't have all of them.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:50):**  And we accept that in other areas of business, but exactly that in farming, we haven't quite  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:54):**  figured out what is okay and what is the standard.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:34:57):**  When we spoke to you, I think it was your Twitter profile that said it, and we kind  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:00):**  of framed the episode as making windows in the walls around agriculture.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:04):**  Has anything changed?  
**[0:35:05-0:35:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:05):**  Are there more windows now?  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:08):**  Is ag as an industry shifting, more diverse, more able to be criticized or introspective?  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:14):**  You know, I'm just one person trying to like get a view of like this really enormous and  
**[0:35:20-0:35:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:20):**  complex thing.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:21):**  So from, I can only speak from my like very personal perspective, but the very cool thing  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:24):**  about this whole process of writing the book, putting out the book, and then starting on  
**[0:35:28-0:35:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:28):**  the research for the second book was having the number of conversations I've had with  
**[0:35:31-0:35:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:31):**  folks who are working right now in the conventional ag industry.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:35):**  And it's just like young to mid-career thoughtful folks who are working because we live in a  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:43):**  capitalist society where you have to work to buy food and take care of your family for  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:48):**  these industries, for these companies, for these organizations that like they know have  
**[0:35:53-0:35:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:53):**  done evil things in the past.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:35:56):**  And they are there and ready to work to say like, listen, I am here to hold this place  
**[0:36:01-0:36:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:01):**  accountable.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:02):**  I'm here to work and to do good things in the world.

**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:09):**  we're going to do, you know, we're going to set up a data program, but it's not going  
**[0:36:14-0:36:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:14):**  to be exploitative of farmers.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:16):**  There is this new wave or this wave of young people and workers in this space that I am  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:22):**  just meeting who are saying, yeah, well, I'm going to be like a thoughtful employee at  
**[0:36:26-0:36:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:26):**  this company and I'm going to hold them to that.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:28):**  And I'm going to like, I know that, you know, just because they write my, they sign my paychecks  
**[0:36:32-0:36:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:32):**  doesn't mean that they're like an infallible company and that the work I'm doing here is  
**[0:36:35-0:36:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:35):**  going to be good.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:36):**  But I'm not going to be responsible for taking advantage of farmers, taking advantage of  
**[0:36:41-0:36:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:41):**  consumers, creating false marketing, putting something out into the environment that's  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:45):**  not safe or creating a product that isn't backed by science that I trust.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:49):**  And in my mind, like, you know, regulations are important.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:53):**  Changing companies, you know, policies and principles are really important.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:36:57):**  But the only way to make all that stuff stick is to have people on the inside who believe  
**[0:37:01-0:37:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:37:01):**  in that stuff.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:37:03):**  And to me, that is the most, you know, that is the thing that is becoming transformative  
**[0:37:07-0:37:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:37:07):**  is that people are coming to work in agriculture, not just on like fun, tiny, sustainable farms  
**[0:37:14-0:37:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:37:14):**  or in little ways, but are striding into supply chains, striding into retail, striding into  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:37:22):**  seed or chemical or these other big places and saying, I'm smart and capable and an asset  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:37:27):**  to this company and I'm going to hold them accountable to doing better.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:37:31):**  And to me, that's a super hopeful story.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:37:35):**  There's also been a change of president in the US since we spoke.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:37:40):**  What are your thoughts about the Biden administration's approach to ag and tech and climate change?  
**[0:37:48-0:37:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:37:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:37:50):**  Biden is not actively rolling back environmental regulation, worker regulation.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:37:57):**  You know, President Trump, as he was leaving office, held wages for farm workers in the

**[0:38:03-0:38:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:03):**  You know, that kind of stuff that happens right at the end of a president's term is  
**[0:38:08-0:38:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:08):**  often overlooked, but can have like long lasting effects that are very detrimental to the industry  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:12):**  and to workers and to so many different people.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:16):**  But it's exciting that we have a new president.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:18):**  It's exciting that he is so focused on climate change and having a different kind of conversation  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:22):**  in that industry has really been cognizant of that, I think, and it's really kind of  
**[0:38:27-0:38:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:27):**  turning in a way to see that.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:30):**  But the Biden administration is still doing a lot, especially at USDA, still spending  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:35):**  a lot of time just trying to unwind some of the problematic, like, you know, the family  
**[0:38:39-0:38:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:39):**  food box program at USDA was a gigantic garbage fire.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:43):**  So you know, I think the focus on climate change will be good.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:46):**  I'm a little my biggest worry, I will say, is that the Biden administration is going  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:50):**  to move too quickly into a carbon market.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:52):**  I think the USDA has a role to play in establishing a standard, just like they have a role to  
**[0:38:57-0:39:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:38:57):**  play in establishing a standard across agricultural commodities.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:01):**  But if USDA goes straight to having a bank, or setting controls on things, I think that  
**[0:39:08-0:39:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:08):**  will be one, it will cement in place a program that as long as it's still controlled by the  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:14):**  private sector is agile and able to move and change and develop in ways that it really  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:19):**  still needs to, because the science is not ready yet.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:23):**  And yeah, as soon as USDA gets involved, it's stuck, right?  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:25):**  It's frozen, because whatever the policy is, is just like how people will change their  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:28):**  businesses and build their whole systems around exactly how the USDA program works.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:33):**  And the USDA isn't ready to build a program yet.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:35):**  So I'm hoping the Biden administration is hearing that feedback that I know a lot of  
**[0:39:38-0:39:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:38):**  people are telling them.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:39):**  I hope they are not rushing to send money out the door to provide this feedback.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:44):**  I hope they're thinking, they're spending time being thoughtful about how they can be  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:49):**  a regulatory party first and not a market creator first.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:54):**  You know, obviously, I would love to see USDA just ramp up some regulation, maybe that's  
**[0:39:58-0:39:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:58):**  EPA's role.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:39:59):**  But, you know, put some let's all decide together how farms should operate in a way that is  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:04):**  not actively, you know, you probably shouldn't be able to sell carbon credits if you're an  
**[0:40:08-0:40:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:08):**  emitter.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:09):**  So maybe let's help farmers stop being emitters, and then we'll be so ready for the carbon  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:13):**  market.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:14):**  Thank you.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:15):**  You know, Sarah, it's amazing how many roads seem to lead back to carbon.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:19):**  It's been such an incredibly popular topic on this podcast.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:22):**  Yeah, and it's because it's such an entirely new space and opening up new revenue streams,  
**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:27):**  especially for farmers, but also agribusinesses and big corporations in this space.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:32):**  And even though it's early, we do actually have to act quickly if we're going to move  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:35):**  the needle on climate change, which ultimately is what it's all about.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:39):**  We're looking hard at the evolving tech landscape and actually through our firm Tenacious Ventures  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:43):**  have made a couple investments in this space like Regrow and Nori.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:47):**  But we really wanted to include a corporate venture perspective too in this episode.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:50):**  So we brought back Derek Norman, VP of venture investment at Leaps by Bear, another one of  
**[0:40:55-0:40:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:55):**  our really popular guests.  
**[0:40:56-0:40:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:56):**  Yes, I remember the episode well.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:40:58):**  It was about 18 months ago.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:00):**  It was done as a live event with Tim Hammarich, who's the host of the Future of Agriculture  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:04):**  podcast and Jim Chambers from Trimble was in it too.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:09):**  So does Derek talk about Carbon too when you spoke to him this time?  
**[0:41:14-0:41:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:14):**  Yes, actually he does.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:16):**  And a lot of other exciting innovations in ag tech that are kind of coming out in this  
**[0:41:19-0:41:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:19):**  space around emissions reduction.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:22):**  Actually he started the conversation though with how much the COVID-19 pandemic as horrible  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:26):**  as it is, has actually sped up investment in ag tech.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:30):**  I think looking back when we spoke originally, it was still sort of fairly early in this  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:35):**  new era of COVID and sort of just changing the way we work.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:38):**  And I think one of the big questions then I think for all investors was sort of how  
**[0:41:44-0:41:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:44):**  that would continue.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:45):**  I think we all had investment pipelines at that time that were at fairly mature stages  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:50):**  and you could sort of see how you might move things that were in the end of that pipeline  
**[0:41:54-0:41:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:54):**  through to completion.  
**[0:41:56-0:41:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:56):**  But then after that, it became a little less clear.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:41:58):**  I think that was a big question mark, but I think now if you look back, I mean, obviously  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:02):**  I think everybody's talking about just the investment pace is extremely rapid.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:07):**  It hasn't slowed anything down at all.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:09):**  And I think if anything, it's really increased.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:12):**  I think many reasons for that.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:13):**  I think one maybe partially it's because there's no obligation to visit companies and now it's  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:20):**  coming back a little bit, but for a long time it was almost impossible to visit companies.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:24):**  So in some ways just shortens the process.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:26):**  And then I think sort of an unintended consequence of people not traveling is sort of freed up  
**[0:42:30-0:42:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:30):**  everybody's schedule.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:32):**  So it actually made it easier to pace projects more quickly and just sort of follow up quickly.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:38):**  And so I think it's just that plus capital markets, right?  
**[0:42:41-0:42:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:41):**  There's just sort of plenty of capital flowing, the stock market's done well and sort of everything  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:45):**  is trickled down and that extends to the venture capital markets where there's sort of a strong  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:50):**  appetite to continue investing and taking risk coupled with, sorry for the longer answer  
**[0:42:55-0:42:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:55):**  here.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:42:56):**  But then I think everybody now realized, like, look at, looks at big sort of dislocations  
**[0:43:01-0:43:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:01):**  that can happen.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:02):**  And we live in a very nonlinear world all of a sudden.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:04):**  So you look at COVID and then you might extend it to other things happening in the world.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:09):**  And so there's also very big problems that face us.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:11):**  And I think there's absolutely a greater awareness of it, not just awareness, but sort of a feeling  
**[0:43:18-0:43:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:18):**  of taking action by entrepreneurs and investors.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:22):**  There's a whole conversation there, but I will move on.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:24):**  So you, LEAPS has a focus on tech and innovation that, as you mentioned before, reduces the  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:29):**  environmental impacts of agriculture, that kind of mission focus that we're seeing more  
**[0:43:33-0:43:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:33):**  interest in, in the space.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:34):**  I've also heard you talk about, you know, paradigm shifts as kind of a concept.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:38):**  What are some of the paradigm shifts you're excited about in any of the technologies or  
**[0:43:43-0:43:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:43):**  specific startups, if you can say, that you think are kind of leading the way around these  
**[0:43:47-0:43:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:47):**  major paradigm shifts in ag?  
**[0:43:49-0:43:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:49):**  Sure.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:50):**  I could think of a couple of projects that maybe they're run through.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:53):**  You know, we've actually announced a couple of investments recently in an area that there  
**[0:43:57-0:44:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:43:57):**  are, you know, there's many companies, I think, taking approaches here and approaching the  
**[0:44:01-0:44:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:01):**  problem differently, but in the field of nitrogen fixation.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:04):**  So we've announced an investment in sound agriculture and in a company called Andy's  
**[0:44:09-0:44:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:09):**  Agriculture, and they each have quite complimentary approaches to sort of solving the problem  
**[0:44:13-0:44:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:13):**  of helping crops produce their own nitrogen, rather than requiring the use of synthetic  
**[0:44:18-0:44:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:18):**  nitrogen.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:19):**  I think each of them, right, so that there's obviously the paradigm in this case is the  
**[0:44:24-0:44:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:24):**  application of synthetic nitrogen.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:25):**  So how do you, how do you move beyond that?  
**[0:44:28-0:44:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:28):**  There's many different ways you could envision it.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:30):**  So sound is taking an approach of sort of developing essentially a bio based input that  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:35):**  can help the plants essentially recruit the microbes that are naturally present in the  
**[0:44:40-0:44:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:40):**  soil to fix nitrogen.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:42):**  So that's a, that's a really interesting approach.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:44):**  It sort of enables what's already there.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:46):**  And then the, you know, very interesting company, Andy's Agriculture, sort of in some ways,  
**[0:44:51-0:44:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:51):**  a complimentary approach, but sort of, they basically have a way of loading microbes onto  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:44:55):**  a seed in a really efficient way that allows for very high colonization rates that once  
**[0:45:01-0:45:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:01):**  again sort of allows for natural microbes that are found in the soil.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:05):**  Although in this case, they're pretreated on the seed to go on, precolonize the plant  
**[0:45:09-0:45:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:09):**  essentially by being loaded at really high levels into the seed.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:12):**  But I just use that to illustrate there's many different ways of solving this challenge.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:16):**  And I don't think a one size fits all approach will work across the globe.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:21):**  One of the other things we talked about was digital agriculture and the difficulties we've  
**[0:45:24-0:45:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:24):**  seen in that sort of taking off are, you know, adoption challenges, returns challenges.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:31):**  How are you seeing the digital ag space?  
**[0:45:33-0:45:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:33):**  Is it getting more traction than a couple of years ago?  
**[0:45:37-0:45:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:37):**  That's been a challenging place for, for companies to scale, to, to really scale to, you know,  
**[0:45:43-0:45:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:43):**  tens or hundreds of millions of acres, which is the scale of agriculture.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:46):**  I think there's probably many reasons for the challenges, but I heard a colleague describe  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:50):**  it well recently, which is distinguishing between features and solutions.  
**[0:45:55-0:46:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:45:55):**  And I think that's been one of the challenges and it's maybe not to criticize the development  
**[0:46:00-0:46:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:00):**  of features because that's sort of the essence of a product, like the first stage, but the  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:04):**  challenge has been the growers and the market is looking for this, you know, sort of the  
**[0:46:08-0:46:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:08):**  whole solution.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:10):**  And often it's not a one-off feature or even two that will solve a problem, especially  
**[0:46:15-0:46:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:15):**  in sort of a complicated set of activities like agriculture.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:18):**  So I think, I don't know, I thought that was a really helpful distinction and sort of helps  
**[0:46:22-0:46:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:22):**  diagnose part of the challenges and digital technologies gaining more traction.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:26):**  But one area, you know, I think the thing that's different now compared to a couple  
**[0:46:29-0:46:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:29):**  of years ago, I think, you know, everyone was focused on yield, which is good, but it's  
**[0:46:33-0:46:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:33):**  also, it's an area of declining marginal returns, I guess, if you're going after, you know,  
**[0:46:38-0:46:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:38):**  additional bushels per acre, I think there are other areas to look at.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:42):**  And certainly a lot of people have realized this, but especially with the advent of carbon  
**[0:46:46-0:46:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:46):**  marketplaces and the potential for growers to capture value through storing carbon or  
**[0:46:51-0:46:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:51):**  utilizing less greenhouse gases in their practices, opened up a whole new value stream for agriculture.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:46:57):**  But then that obviously is going to take a lot of different technology, which doesn't  
**[0:47:02-0:47:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:02):**  involve traditional agricultural inputs.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:04):**  And that technology does not yet exist.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:06):**  So if you just sort of look at the market size there of a couple hundred million acres  
**[0:47:10-0:47:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:10):**  and a couple of 10, 10 to a hundred dollars per acre, depending on how much carbon can  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:15):**  be stored, it's a pretty large market that really there's, that technology is really  
**[0:47:19-0:47:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:19):**  in its infancy there.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:21):**  That's something we've certainly seen in making this podcast, that there's a ton of interest  
**[0:47:24-0:47:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:24):**  and excitement, maybe even hype and skepticism around soil carbon.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:29):**  It's one of the most popular topics we've had on the podcast.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:32):**  It sounds like you're sort of bullish on this as an opportunity.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:35):**  I think so as a, as a market, there's obviously so many questions, but that's always true  
**[0:47:40-0:47:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:40):**  of new markets, I think.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:41):**  But you start to get into carbon storage and thinking about what does that mean and how  
**[0:47:45-0:47:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:45):**  does it work on agricultural land?  
**[0:47:47-0:47:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:47):**  And it's, it's sort of difficult, right?  
**[0:47:48-0:47:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:48):**  Because you're, you have to think about timescale and organic carbon and its life cycle throughout  
**[0:47:54-0:47:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:54):**  in the geochemistry of the soil.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:55):**  Like it's very complicated, very fast.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:47:58):**  And I don't think the science is quite up to being able to track that all.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:02):**  So then it gets a question of sort of how, how effective in some ways are those carbon  
**[0:48:06-0:48:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:06):**  credits?  
**[0:48:07-0:48:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:07):**  And what's on that versus greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, maybe nitrogen application  
**[0:48:12-0:48:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:12):**  and decarbonizing the inputs going into agriculture.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:15):**  So there's so many different ways it can go, but yeah, I think it's sort of a greenfield,  
**[0:48:19-0:48:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:19):**  no pun intended for, for agriculture.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:21):**  It's a totally new value stream growth area for the industry as a, frankly, as it may  
**[0:48:25-0:48:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:25):**  be as a scientist or as an investor, it's, it's interesting also, cause there's just  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:29):**  so many different technologies or capabilities that could be applied to the space from digital  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:34):**  to inputs, to looking at how you produce nitrogen to sort of how the plants are grown.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:39):**  So there's just so many different angles to pursue.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:41):**  I find that very exciting.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:43):**  A hundred percent, no shortage of areas to look at in this space, kind of changing gears  
**[0:48:47-0:48:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:47):**  a little bit, Derek, how do you see corporate venture arms like, like leaps by bear fitting  
**[0:48:51-0:48:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:51):**  in with the broader ag industry or kind of big ag.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:55):**  And I guess where my head's going is, you know, some of the big chem and seed companies  
**[0:48:58-0:49:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:48:58):**  didn't have amazing reputations 10, 20, whatever years ago.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:03):**  And there's still social license challenges around big ag today.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:07):**  Is that changing?

**[0:49:14-0:49:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:14):**  That's a good point on the social license, but I also say, you know, if you really want  
**[0:49:18-0:49:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:18):**  to have a huge effect, positive effect on the world, companies like Bayer that have  
**[0:49:24-0:49:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:24):**  a massive footprint you know, Corteva Syngenta and other, you know, essentially since any  
**[0:49:29-0:49:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:29):**  large companies actually are huge levers for change in a positive sense.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:34):**  And frankly, that's where they want to go, right?  
**[0:49:36-0:49:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:36):**  They may not be there today, but they know for the sustainability of their own business.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:40):**  You know, you look at what is, what is Bayer's or Syngenta's or Corteva's business model  
**[0:49:44-0:49:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:44):**  look like in 20 or 30 years, it will be very different.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:49):**  And the kinds of solutions it sells or offers will be very, very different.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:53):**  So I see, you know, I see corporate venture and this particular leaps by Bayer is sort  
**[0:49:57-0:50:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:49:57):**  of a bridge to help Bayer get from, from here to there, you know, taking advantage of paradigm  
**[0:50:02-0:50:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:02):**  shifting sort of breakthrough technologies that can solve problems for new markets.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:07):**  It sort of helps provide a stepping stone for, for a large corporation like this company  
**[0:50:12-0:50:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:12):**  to evolve into a different kind of business as the needs of society change over time.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:16):**  Otherwise, you know, society will leave in some ways, leave the companies behind.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:21):**  So I think that's a key role of corporate venture capital.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:24):**  It's not just insight into the future, but it's sort of strategically sort of setting  
**[0:50:28-0:50:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:28):**  up the company to, to be able to make the moves necessary to, to evolve its own business.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:33):**  And I just want to reiterate the point.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:35):**  I mean, I think companies like this with such a large footprint in the environment are actually  
**[0:50:39-0:50:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:39):**  great levers for change.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:41):**  So you think about nitrogen fixation and if you could offer even just through breeding,  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:45):**  for example, like marginally offer a plant that's you know, maybe a few pounds less of  
**[0:50:50-0:50:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:50):**  nitrogen per acre that would just have a fairly large effect, right?  
**[0:50:54-0:50:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:54):**  It's a thin effect, but spread out over a large acreage would, would be a pretty, pretty  
**[0:50:58-0:50:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:58):**  big change for the world.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:50:59):**  It's really interesting to say that.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:00):**  I mean, I think I've told you this before, my personal journey into ag was through like  
**[0:51:05-0:51:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:05):**  small organic, you know, vegetable production in a developing country.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:09):**  And I came at this like, you know, Monsanto is evil, these big companies, you know, watching  
**[0:51:13-0:51:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:13):**  all the documentaries and have ended up in a wait, timeout.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:16):**  If we want to really change the system, these companies don't want to do anything that's  
**[0:51:19-0:51:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:19):**  bad for the world.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:20):**  There's a lot of smart, well, many people in there.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:22):**  And by the way, if they do something and make a small change, you can turn that ship.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:25):**  You can really change the world.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:27):**  So that, that very much echoes my personal journey.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:29):**  And to your point before the kind of talent that wants to come into this space now and  
**[0:51:33-0:51:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:33):**  the opportunities at a big company, you know, a startup might only be hiring five or 10  
**[0:51:37-0:51:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:37):**  people, 15 people, 20 people a year, the kind of scale at which we can get smart people  
**[0:51:41-0:51:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:41):**  into this industry is, is unparalleled with big companies.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:45):**  When you look at ag tech and ag and kind of the next five years, what's most exciting  
**[0:51:50-0:51:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:50):**  for you?  
**[0:51:51-0:51:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:51):**  What's really going to move the needle?  
**[0:51:52-0:51:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:52):**  One thing I have been thinking about recently, you know, synthetic biology, buzzword, it's  
**[0:51:57-0:51:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:57):**  more than a buzzword, right?  
**[0:51:58-0:52:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:51:58):**  It's a whole bio revolution that's happening.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:01):**  Just a combination of confluence of so many trends and discovery.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:05):**  So truly the pace of life science discovery, I'd say is at least an order of magnitude  
**[0:52:10-0:52:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:10):**  higher than 10 years ago or 20 years ago.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:12):**  And that's because of access to obviously to genomics, you can sequence individual plants  
**[0:52:16-0:52:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:16):**  or humans and really get a massive amount of data that gives you a lot of scientific  
**[0:52:21-0:52:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:21):**  insight.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:22):**  We obviously want to engineer living systems, I think to help solve some of the greatest  
**[0:52:26-0:52:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:26):**  challenges in the world, but a lot of that is being applied to microbes because it's  
**[0:52:29-0:52:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:29):**  easy, right?  
**[0:52:30-0:52:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:30):**  I mean, it's easy to, to, to transform E. coli and manipulate them.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:33):**  And we're learning a lot about their metabolic systems.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:36):**  Plants are much harder, right?  
**[0:52:37-0:52:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:37):**  If you compare, like I would say like the synthetic biology of plants is still more  
**[0:52:40-0:52:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:40):**  or less in the dark ages compared to where we're at with microbes.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:44):**  So that's just sort of a problem I'm thinking about.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:46):**  No solutions are obvious or apparent today, but if you sort of break down the problem  
**[0:52:51-0:52:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:51):**  of why, why can't you do all of these things you do for sort of high throughput engineering  
**[0:52:56-0:52:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:56):**  and microbes, how can you do that on plants?  
**[0:52:58-0:53:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:52:58):**  I think is sort of an interesting question to think about.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:02):**  Some great points there.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:03):**  You know, I think what has been so good about making this podcast is being able to follow  
**[0:53:07-0:53:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:07):**  the journeys of innovators who come from all different backgrounds and then just see where  
**[0:53:12-0:53:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:12):**  they end up.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:13):**  And I have to say you, Sarah, have been on a bit of a journey of discovery with this  
**[0:53:18-0:53:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:18):**  podcast.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:19):**  Now I've only been with the team for a bit over a year.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:21):**  So I wanted to ask you, why did you want to start Ag Tech?  
**[0:53:25-0:53:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:25):**  So what in the first place?  
**[0:53:26-0:53:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:26):**  We glad you did.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:27):**  I've got a job out of it, but why did you want to start it?  
**[0:53:31-0:53:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:31):**  Yes.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:32):**  And I have to thank you too, because one of the things that's been so great for me about  
**[0:53:34-0:53:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:34):**  making this podcast is having you on board to help.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:37):**  So thank you for all your work behind the scenes.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:39):**  But I really started the podcast and we did as a company and a team because there were  
**[0:53:43-0:53:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:43):**  so many untold stories that I was hearing about and meeting people that are really just  
**[0:53:48-0:53:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:48):**  sometimes non-traditional innovators or folks kind of flying under the radar that I just  
**[0:53:53-0:53:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:53):**  thought were worth telling the stories of and kind of shouting them from the rooftops.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:53:57):**  And really then it gave me an excuse to talk to them and to share those stories with other  
**[0:54:00-0:54:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:00):**  people.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:01):**  Given I love podcasts and didn't want to do anything with video, I thought it was really  
**[0:54:04-0:54:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:04):**  a good chance to do that.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:06):**  But we've come a long way, not just changing the name of the podcast, like you said, but  
**[0:54:10-0:54:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:10):**  taking on a bunch of feedback from our listeners to hopefully improve, which we really appreciate.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:14):**  One big one was our audio quality.

**[0:54:21-0:54:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:21):**  Well, as I promised earlier, I found some of the original intro.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:26):**  It's from four years ago.

**[0:54:45-0:54:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:45):**  On this podcast, we will bring in leading speakers in technology, entrepreneurship,  
**[0:54:50-0:54:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:50):**  investment, agriculture, science, and anything else you can think of and we can find in the  
**[0:54:54-0:54:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:54):**  world of ag tech.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:55):**  We'll look to demystify it so that we're getting to the so what.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:54:58):**  What does it really mean for farmers and for the broader agricultural industry?  
**[0:55:01-0:55:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:01):**  I'm farming and I grow it.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:07):**  I'm farming and I grow it.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:12):**  Sarah, it's all part of the iteration process you talk about.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:18):**  Yes.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:19):**  Well, and part of iterating is failing and apparently being embarrassed.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:23):**  So thank you for that, Kato.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:26):**  We also lost a bunch of, no, we also lost a bunch of the early episodes, but actually  
**[0:55:30-0:55:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:30):**  I think maybe that's okay because the audio quality as our listeners constantly told us  
**[0:55:35-0:55:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:35):**  was pretty crap.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:36):**  But really the best thing about the podcast is you, the listener.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:39):**  And so we put a call out asking you to tell us about yourself, what ag tech you've tried  
**[0:55:44-0:55:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:44):**  or what ag tech industry you're involved in and where you see the future of this industry  
**[0:55:48-0:55:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:48):**  going.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:49):**  And this is what you said.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:51):**  Jonathan Zettler with Fieldwalker Agronomy in Ontario, Canada, and really enjoyed the  
**[0:55:58-0:56:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:55:58):**  Ag Tech So What podcast mainly because you get your listeners like myself to ask better  
**[0:56:05-0:56:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:05):**  questions as we try and explore this space.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:07):**  And for myself this year, looking for remote sensing technology within this agronomy business,  
**[0:56:17-0:56:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:17):**  and it's enabled me to invest a percentage of our revenue and maybe take some calculated  
**[0:56:22-0:56:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:22):**  risks to try and identify that.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:24):**  But the podcasts that I've enjoyed the most focus on how to properly frame the problem  
**[0:56:30-0:56:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:30):**  and then look for solutions that address that and keep up the great work.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:35):**  Really enjoy it.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:36):**  Thanks.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:37):**  Hey guys.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:38):**  Hey, my name is Marek.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:39):**  I'm a founder of a small startup based in Brisbane called Terano.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:44):**  We are makers of long range soil moisture sensors.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:48):**  So obviously the irrigation topic that you recorded was of particular interest to me.  
**[0:56:53-0:57:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:56:53):**  And I can't agree more with what you described as the psychology of the farmers that's basically  
**[0:57:00-0:57:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:00):**  stopping the adoption of those new technologies.  
**[0:57:03-0:57:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:03):**  We'll be trying to approach them in exactly that way.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:07):**  So instead of trying to focus on technology and how good our devices are, we're basically  
**[0:57:14-0:57:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:14):**  looking at solving the problems and just proving that we have something that they will potentially  
**[0:57:22-0:57:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:22):**  need and it will make an impact, measurable impact on something they own.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:28):**  So thanks again guys.  
**[0:57:30-0:57:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:30):**  Keep up the good work.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:31):**  Hello, this is Nick Seymour from Farmo.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:34):**  We are an Australian ag tech company trying to solve problems on the ground for producers  
**[0:57:40-0:57:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:40):**  with ag tech.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:41):**  The question posed in this podcast is where is ag tech going in the future?  
**[0:57:45-0:57:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:45):**  In our opinion, it's going exactly where you want it to go.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:49):**  Ag tech is simply another tool in your toolkit to save you time and save you money when you  
**[0:57:55-0:57:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:55):**  think you could be better off doing other things.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:57:58):**  For instance, if you're like me and you hate getting a call from the Cavendish cop to tell  
**[0:58:02-0:58:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:58:02):**  you you've got cattle on the road because the solar energizer has gone down after a  
**[0:58:08-0:58:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:58:08):**  few cloudy days, well, you can get some ag tech that's going to send a message to your  
**[0:58:12-0:58:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:58:12):**  phone whenever the voltage drops on your electric fence line.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:58:17):**  One thing we haven't been able to do is invent a time machine, which is unfortunate because  
**[0:58:22-0:58:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:58:22):**  one of the worst things we have to do in the agriculture industry is just drive these long  
**[0:58:28-0:58:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:58:28):**  distances with hours and hours of boring miles in the car.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:58:33):**  And for that, we are very thankful for the technology of podcasts.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:58:39):**  And today we're celebrating the ag tech, so what podcast reaching a hundred episodes,  
**[0:58:45-0:58:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:58:45):**  which is an enormous achievement and so well done.  
**[0:58:48-0:58:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:58:48):**  It makes our driving these long distances just that little bit easier.  
**[0:58:56-0:58:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/21/100th-episode-special#t=0:58:56):**  So great.

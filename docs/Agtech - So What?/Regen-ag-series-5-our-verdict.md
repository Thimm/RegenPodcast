### Agtech - So What?  (2020-09-23)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:00:00):**  Hey, Kristen.  Hey, Sarah.  How are you going?  
**[0:00:03-0:00:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:00:03):**  I need you to do something for me.  Yeah, sure.  What is it?  
**[0:00:06-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:00:06):**  Can you host the podcast?  Okay.  Yep.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:00:09):**  When?  Like, right now?  Now?  
**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:00:12):**  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Who am I talking to?  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:00:15):**  Well, I was thinking for the Regen Ag series, Matthew and I have been doing a bunch in this  space, and you know, you know, you can do a bunch of things.  I'm not going to do a bunch of things.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:00:25):**  I'm going to do a bunch of things.  Matthew and I have been doing a bunch in this space, and you know, you've got a background  in radio, and you're a farmer, so we might switch and you can host.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:00:34):**  What do you think?  Okay.  Okay.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:00:37):**  It might sound...  No, it'll be fine.  Okay.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:00:40):**  Yep, sure.  Hello, and welcome to Ag Tech So What.  I'm your host, Kirsten Diprose.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:00:47):**  Don't freak out.  Sarah will be back as host, but this time she is one of the guests along with her fellow  business partner at Agthentic, Matthew Pryor.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:00:57):**  Sarah doesn't usually share her opinion in the podcast, but given Matthew and Sarah have  extensive knowledge in benchmarking and data tools, as well as food supply chains, and  can speak from an investor perspective, they also happen to be founders of Tenacious Ventures,  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:01:13):**  which is an agri-food venture capital firm.  They might actually have something to say.  Look, sure, they're my bosses, so I guess I kind of had to say that.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:01:23):**  But what I just said is all true.  I'll tell you what I really think about them another time.  But this episode is all about the Regen Ag verdict.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:01:31):**  How do we move the data tools forward so we can better measure the big claims of Regen?  Who's wanting to invest in it?  And will Regen Ag ever break away from the emotionally charged debate over semantics?  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:01:43):**  Oh, and if you haven't listened to our other episodes in our Regen Ag series, I highly  recommend that you go back and listen now.  This episode will still make sense, but you'll get a lot more out of it if you've heard  
**[0:01:55-0:01:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:01:55):**  the rest of the series.  Let's first cast our minds back to the diversity of views we heard in the series.  This is Mark Wootten, the carbon neutral farmer who's also a Regen Ag skeptic.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:02:08):**  If we are going to feed 10 million people in the world and we are going to have to produce  protein for them, Regen Ag's not going to cut it.  We're going to have to look at some of the more intense systems being kinder to the environment,  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:02:22):**  having a higher level of social licence.  I'm an atheist when it comes to Regen Ag.  I think that that is an evangelical movement and I think that they need to come up with  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:02:33):**  the science and they keep coming and I keep saying, send me the science that shows me  peer reviewed science that shows me the outcome and not one of them has produced it yet.  We also heard from farmers on the other end of the Regen Ag spectrum like Sam Trethewey,  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:02:48):**  who's producing carbon positive beef.  If you're speculative about regenerative agriculture, you probably need to get out from underneath  your rock and stop looking through the world through a keyhole and open your mind.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:02:59):**  To be completely upfront, I get very defensive of it.  There's guys out there in New Zealand, America, mainland Australia running several thousand acres.  They've got input costs that are at 20 or 30% of what they used to be and they're producing  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:03:11):**  as much, if not more food. Their soils are incredible.  And we've heard from the big food corporations who are moving towards Regen Ag.  So let's get into this episode.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:03:22):**  First up is Matthew Pryor on why Regen Ag is an important Ag tech issue to be focusing on right now.  Yeah, yeah, like it's a fascinating topic.  I mean, we don't come at it from a Regen point of view specifically,  
**[0:03:37-0:03:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:03:37):**  but what we're really interested in in Agthene is what are the things that are going to drive significant levels of land use transition.  That transition can take all forms. But, you know, Regen is a really interesting kind of land use transition.  All the various guests we had on the pods brought out all these amazing variety of of conversations.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:03:59):**  But importantly, also in their kind of nuances of diving into, you know, how data driven it is, how customer focused it is.  That's the stuff that we really want to zero in on.  The reasons that drive change, the things that really scale something up from being niche or confined to a small number of people  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:04:18):**  to something that's really going to deliver impact and significant transition in agriculture.  Sarah Nolan, what interests you about Regen?  You've obviously done a lot of work in the supply chain space, in the business and growth space.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:04:33):**  What are the main aspects that really need honing in on when it comes to Regen Ag and the future of it?  Yeah, I guess where I kind of come from is I remember I spent a year in South America living on farms and was on a small organic vegetable farm  and saw the challenges they faced in trying to communicate to their consumers about how good their practices were  
**[0:04:55-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:04:55):**  and why it was different and how it was differentiated.  And next door was a large scale vineyard that was just fully conventional, pumping through equipment and selling into a very different supply chain  and living on one and next to the other.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:05:07):**  I came home and was like, okay, you know, this is the right way to do it.  You want to be small scale and you want, you know, hand picked.  And then you go to a grocery store in the States and you're just overwhelmed by choice.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:05:19):**  And I was literally paralyzed. Like, what do I buy?  And when I come at it now from the technology angle, what's exciting is now we have so many tools or increasingly a range of tools for producers to respond to the changing consumer preferences  and to say, you know, I want to produce something that gives the consumer this experience and I want to use these tools to actually prove that that's true.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:05:44):**  Instead of just have it be something I believe in or something I want to do, you can actually start to connect it all the way down the supply chain.  And that's where the future starts to get really exciting is going beyond just what we hope or think or can say at a small scale to being able to prove it's true all the way down the supply chain.  I guess part of the difficulty with regenerative agriculture as well is, I mean, they often refer to it as a journey and the journey is so different for everyone who's on it.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:06:10):**  I'd love to start with Sam Trethewey and we can hear a bit from him.  He's a farmer who's definitely all in when he comes to Regen Ag and he produces carbon positive beef on his farm in Tasmania.  Regenerative is a fairly loose term and what it actually means to certain people and producers kind of varies.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:06:30):**  But for us, it means that we follow a fairly regimented time controlled grazing system or cell grazing is more commonly known.  We also use a lot of multi species crops across our farm and we have also moved away from insecticides, fungicides, most herbicides and all synthetic fertiliser.  And yes, I mean, we think and, you know, Steph, my wife, when we were planning this business said, well, what's after grass fed?  
**[0:06:54-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:06:54):**  Like, what's the next thing? And for us, it was carbon positive beef or beef that's produced in a way that actually heals and encourages the environment to do what it's supposed to do.  So that was Sam Trethewey there. What are your thoughts on his business idea and business model? Sarah, we'll start with you.  Yeah, it's funny, actually, like Sam sort of is connected right into the hearts and minds of consumers.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:07:18):**  Like he's saying exactly what consumers want to hear.  And you can also imagine, you know, Mark Wooten or Will Vignall like cringing as he's saying that because it's exactly what drives them crazy.  And so what I what I love about what Sam's done and unabashedly so is said, we're thinking about our customer and we're producing and talking about it.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:07:39):**  Everything is about what the end consumer wants and starting to bring in some of the data underpinnings.  Although maybe that's where some of the disagreement might come in with with other producers and how they see it.  Matthew?  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:07:50):**  Yeah, I mean, it's hard to separate the medium from the message in Sam's case.  I mean, Sarah and I both know Sam pretty well and also his journey.  And it's no coincidence that his background includes both a deep understanding and advertising and brand development,  
**[0:08:07-0:08:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:08:07):**  as well as being really significant contributor to the creation of the agtech ecosystem here in Australia.  So I actually think it's Sam's perspective is fascinating in that way, because when we talk about who do we want to recruit into this journey,  we also talk so much about bringing people in from outside or people who have different perspectives.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:08:29):**  And whilst it's also true that Sam's heritage very much is tied up in agriculture, the kind of views that he's brought in from the tours of duty he's done elsewhere.  You can really see playing out in real time. It's a fascinating story and it'll be fascinating to watch over the coming years.  Let's hear from Sam again. This is more about his business model.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:08:50):**  How do you watch the startups be very effective at getting big heavy things off their balance sheet?  Because if you've got heavy things on your balance sheet, you've got to raise more money and therefore give away more equity.  Right. And I hate to use these cliched examples of Airbnb and Uber, but you've got, you know, biggest transport company in the world doesn't own a car.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:09:07):**  You know, that whole thing. How can we be a big beef producer and not own a cow?  So we actually put our high growth waggies into dairies. They don't want half their calf drop.  They actually kill them under a week old. And so they've got an animal welfare issue and we therefore pivot a waste product into a high value product.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:09:23):**  And we essentially breed cattle without owning cows.  I mean, I love that grab and it's there's so much insight and knowledge and experience packed into those couple of sentences and also the stuff Sam touches on in his typical way that he's not afraid of kind of tackling tough issues.  I mean, the whole issue of potty calves and, you know, I mean, dairies challenged in that way.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:09:48):**  So I think it's whether you can specifically replicate that exact example or I think the more the better way to look at it is it's a fantastic example of business model innovation.  So rather than thinking about duplicating exactly, the lesson to take out of what Sam's doing is, you know, taking a different business model approach.  So for sure, that could be scaled up. They can scale it up. There's lots of other opportunity there.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:10:13):**  I love the idea of getting livestock off your balance sheet.  The other thing he talks about there is the value of the brand.  And I see how that's playing out in a lot of the work we do when producers can control more of their own brand and have that direct brand into consumers, just how it shifts the control they have, the power they have.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:10:33):**  And with technology now, whether it's social media influencers and YouTube or, you know, the actual brand on the package, it totally changes the equation.  And we're seeing more and more producers want to tap into that and build that brand focus for what they do.  So most of it actually was marketing and branding, to be honest. It was that ability to stand by this data and say, look what we've done.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:10:53):**  The next part of it would have been, you know, I believe it's the right thing to do.  And if it's the right thing to do, I want to be able to prove to the world that we've done this and what better to use in this particular methodology.  And I suppose the last point was that was the carbon credit value, was the money.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:11:08):**  I mean, we might end up getting, I don't know, 13 to 16, 17 grand a year in carbon credits from about year three or four, once the soil's kind of got itself sorted.  That's not to be sneezed at. That's not too bad. But it's like whatever.  The value that that testing and that validation will present to us in the market at a meat and consumer levels far greater than 13 grand.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:11:31):**  So Sam Trethewey there, on that point you made there, Sarah, I mean, he doesn't walk away from the fact that it is all about marketing and branding.  But how dangerous an approach is that for a farming business, particularly if they're shifting from conventional methods to trying other business models or regenerative agriculture?  Yeah, I mean, any new practice and any new business approach can, of course, be risky.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:11:58):**  What I think is exciting, at least from a kind of tech, so what perspective is where technology can underpin some of that.  And Sam talks about it, you know, how can we prove that what we're doing is actually good, both for us in a farming system as in more productive outputs, etc.  But also prove that it is a better welfare outcome or environmental benefit.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:12:18):**  And right now that's really expensive in many cases. And so it is a bit of a leap of faith.  But when technology improves as it is, you start to close the gap and be able to actually prove that what you're doing does have the intended outcome.  I think the risk there is a casual listen, you might come away from that thinking that's kind of cynical.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:12:39):**  But really, when you dig in, Sam's actually saying, we're doing it for the brand value, but we stand behind the numbers.  And importantly, we pay a lot of attention to the fact that the methodology has international credibility.  It was interesting. I had two different conversations with listeners after that episode that called in and were like, you know, it's great that Sam's having a go.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:13:00):**  But let's see what he says in 20 years and let's see if he was doing it somewhere that doesn't have quite as high rainfall and isn't Tasmanian.  So I think interesting to hear pushback from various perspectives of other producers.  And certainly we got a lot of pushback from Will Bignall, who's also a Tasmanian mixed farmer, and he admires what Sam is doing in one sense, certainly.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:13:24):**  But he's also worried about some of the regen and the marketing and talks about how that regen really seems to favour the end consumer.  And that starting from the end consumers point of view could, in his view, endanger farmers.  I get really challenged by this idea because regen really invigorates the end consumer.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:13:45):**  The buy in is massive for it. It is such a clever word because what is the opposite of regen?  I'm a degenerative farmer. I'm not regenerative. I turn around and say 200 years in the same patch of dirt.  I irrigate, I use for, I drive tractors, I import nutrients and I export heaps.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:14:01):**  And I'm making money, I'm happy and I think my landscape looks good.  So I get very torn by the whole concept.  I wasn't in agriculture. Anyone who's smart and switched on is a good manager and a good business head on them is going to succeed in ag regardless.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:14:18):**  Especially if it's your own business, you've got that buy in.  And I, I put the fear of God in me that I'm watching people get really good at grazing, go and utilise a heap more feed, grow a heap more feed.  They can up their stocking rate because they've just learned to graze.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:14:34):**  Then you turn around and say, no, you don't need to put on phosphate.  Well, I can tell you now what happens after 15 years of drought and dry spells and diversification.  You can't grow anything. Yeah, to me, I just don't buy in.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:14:45):**  And I think that's the important thing. The consumers are buying in left, right and centre, but you don't see farmers buying in.  And to me, that raises alarm bells when a brand is holding the system up and say, this is it.  And you're not getting farmers buy in. I just smell a wrath.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:14:59):**  Anyone want to jump in on that?  Yeah, I mean, it's fascinating.  I mean, the first issue you can't, it's very hard to argue with Will because there's a lot of track record and a lot of hard fought and won experience and credible technical, agronomic, scientific opinion behind that.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:15:19):**  But I think you've got to pick it apart.  So there's the kind of reaction to the brandness of Regen and like that's pretty understandable in some ways.  I think it is a very important point that what we have to try very hard to work against is oversimplification, having unintended consequences.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:15:41):**  That's super important. I think the point is you've got to go to the data and it's got to be over a long enough period of time.  I think the one probably caution there really is on the consumer side that increasingly the ability for the consumer to make a more data driven decision will come out.  And so we will start to move away from that oversimplification risk.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:16:04):**  And you have to be prepared for that level of transparency to have the argument.  And actually, I think that relates to Jay and the General Mills podcast, because one thing I loved is they didn't just say we're doing Regen and so we'll slap the label on a few nice brands.  They took a pilot approach in different areas with different incentives and different testing and different thinking about the science and the advice and how it will work for the farmers and not just saying we're going to slap a label on it because it's what consumers want.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:16:34):**  I don't know the boots on the ground view of that and what farmers are saying and how much they do and don't buy in.  But I love that it's not oversimplifying the answer for consumers and actually starting with the farmers to say, how can we get buy in and what do you need?  Is it advice? Is it financial incentives? Is it market access? But what's actually going to move the needle for soil health if we believe that fundamentally that's good for production?  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:16:58):**  Let's hear from Jay Watson from General Mills.  And some of the pilots that we've announced publicly, it's more around supporting producers and their kind of evolution in their approach and mindset to managing farm.  And so it's more education, training and technical assistance, one on one coaching.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:17:15):**  And that's funded by General Mills. You know, that's that's something we can do now is to support that technical assistance as we see that as being a really key gap.  We hear from a lot of producers as, hey, you know what, I am energized. I just went to a soil health conference or learned about regenerative ag from someone and I got back to my farm and I'm just not sure where to start or what to do.  We're funding those producers in our programs for three years as part of our pilots.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:17:42):**  And so that's, you know, it's not a it's not a financial assistance play where we're providing cost share.  We are doing that in some places, but we really view one of the key barriers is this this understanding of how the ecosystem could function and an understanding of how to apply regenerative principles to unique operations.  Is that basically some of the problem is that farmers feel that they have to shoulder all the risk of trying out these new practices for the benefit of the end consumer?  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:18:13):**  Should we be looking at corporations or government to shoulder some of that risk? Matthew?  Yeah, I mean, I'm smiling because, yeah, like completely. I think there's I unpack two kind of major things out of Jay's grab there.  The first certainly is in a lot of these systems.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:18:32):**  So we talked about land use transition at the start. And when you know, when we think about how land use transition is going to take place, absolutely. The alignment of the investment and the reward would have to be the primary design element of the program.  So, you know, your question was about like, is it is it reasonable for producers to bear all this cost first and then get a benefit later?  Like, no, it is the case currently and degree to which that's true in organic or regen or anything else is going to vary.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:19:04):**  But that's one of the areas where technology and change will really take place.  I think that the second part is this is the future calling for sure. The role of the consumer facing food brands in extending services, agronomic training services directly to farmers.  I think we're only seeing the very early days of that.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:19:29):**  What do you think about General Mills and look, there are other companies that are doing similar training or similar uptake of regen practices or at least sustainability practices and helping farmers gain knowledge.  But I mean, Jay even said there that it wasn't about cost incentive so much. It's still about education. Do they need to go a step forward?  Where do you think this kind of corporate intervention is at the moment, Sarah?  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:19:56):**  It really depends in my experience from supply chain to supply chain and producer to producer.  And so, you know, whatever you want to call it, greenwashing or good business. There's a set of practices here that are what makes your farm profitable.  And that's what the best managers are doing. But other farmers do need that support or maybe don't have that that knowledge or understanding of how to implement these things when they are new or they are uncertain or it is taking a bit of a leap of faith.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:20:21):**  And we're seeing brands put in tiered supplier programs or you can look at New Zealand Marino and the tenure forward contracts or other kinds of incentives that go beyond just education, but to actual financial rewards to get the flywheel, so to speak, spun up to start using these practices.  Now, what's exciting is you can get started. And what's challenging is does it actually work?  And so there's a balance there to be struck of not incentivizing behavior or practices that aren't actually going to prove out to be better for the environment or, you know, in the worst case, worse for the producer.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:20:58):**  I found it ironic in some ways, listening kind of back and thinking about this chat to go all the way back to the Mark episode, because he did a lot of that quantification work and offered up jigsaw farms to support that and didn't pay for it because the researchers were paying for it.  And it was aligned with him wanting to get that data, wanting to see that science and with the practices he was already doing.  So in some ways, kind of enabling the transition away from evangelical into more data driven by being just an early adopter and having other drivers that drove why he did it, you know, that they like birds on the property, wanted trees for succession planning.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:21:35):**  It was a combination of drivers, but he actually was laying that groundwork to get some of that science and research done.  And Tim is a really interesting example, and he's a farmer in the southwest of Victoria in Australia.  Let's listen to how he became carbon neutral, how his farm started on this journey.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:21:56):**  Melbourne Uni actually approached us and we worked with them on doing a full audit of our carbon footprint in it using predominantly grass grow models.  It's quite exhausting, but it's actually been peer reviewed and published through CSIRO, the paper now, and we achieved carbon neutrality here in 2011.  And that's predominantly by having about 18 percent of the farms down to trees for floor logs or for permanent revegetation shelter belts.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:22:23):**  And the motivation was there, but we had to say, I think we're there and using some of the perhaps the simpler tools, but not quite as accurate tools.  We went through the full process. I would not encourage anyone to do it.  It's quite an arduous process and not necessarily a commercial reward one.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:22:42):**  I love that he's done it. But he then says it's got no commercial reward.  I don't encourage anyone to do it from the from the kind of idea that there's no money in it anyway.  But yeah, but that's that's the lesson there, right?  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:22:56):**  I mean, like Sarah was saying, you've got to also consider that this was a decent amount of time ago.  And so the participation he got from the research sector was because they were genuinely interested in working out how to do it more accurately, better, faster.  But, you know, when we kind of zoom back to the why do people do this stuff, behaviour change incentives, Mark's also pretty clear about what that you know, what those were.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:23:18):**  There were some commercial elements in the tree plantings, sure.  But the construction of the shelter belts and the native habitat and just the visceral experience of being in the land with the greater species diversity and all that kind of stuff.  But, you know, I think as we think about, OK, how that was going, like he said, it was arduous.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:23:38):**  I don't recommend it. Yeah, we've got to do better. But there are better methods.  There will be better ways to come along.  And so pushing toward everybody having understanding of their the emissions intensity of their production and the ability of their production to undertake sequestration activity as well.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:23:58):**  For sure, we want that. Then it's certainly people like Mark who are prepared to do it often for different reasons that push the high art forward.  He goes on to say that there has been an economic reward and he's running a very successful business.  This is more of what he has to say about being carbon neutral and how that's impacted productivity.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:24:22):**  Well, we're in a strong position, really.  If we do like to actually sell our product through a carbon neutral scheme, which is a scalability is our issue because, you know, how do you do it?  We're in a strong position where we can put our hands and our hearts and quite legitimately say, well, here's a study that Syro is peer reviewed.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:24:39):**  There's rigour in the system. But there's also, you know, you sleep pretty good at night, you know, and we produce in these, you know, in Australian context,  about 10 percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by ruminant animals. Sheep are about four percent of the total footprint.  And in that context, it's it's a really useful thing that we you know, we can say, well, we've got part of the solution worked out.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:24:59):**  Although I should say, I think the solution for most people isn't isn't the trees.  I think most of it's going to be about feed efficiency and looking at a ruminant change going forward,  whether that's using feeds or whether it's using some of the inhibitor or some of the injections that you could use going forward.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:25:16):**  What are some of your reflections on that, Sarah?  He did the study 10 years ago and now he's looking at carbon credits.  Yeah, I mean, I guess I start to wear the investor hat that we also wear through Tenacious Ventures and start to see and get excited about some of the investment areas we've looked at, you know,  
**[0:25:37-0:25:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:25:37):**  whether it's technologies that enable feed efficiency, that unlock farmer rewards through those carbon markets in different ways.  That's verification and validation that decreases the cost of some of these measurements.  You know, that just starts to be really exciting times for ag tech and for investment and innovation in some of these areas as technology advances.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:25:58):**  There's more than one way to skin a cat as well, really, isn't there?  I love that he zooms out, though, on that. So he basically says, look, yeah, we do trees and there were a bunch of reasons for them.  But in reality, you've got to look at that total picture. And so for a lot of people, there will be enteric commissions, you know,  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:26:14):**  won't be sequestration activity through vegetation or subsurface, you know, subsoil.  That'll be the significant move for them to make first. And I think that's also really important.  That kind of goes beyond the regen or not regen discussion to just say, well, look, in the end, it's about measuring an impact.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:26:35):**  It's got to be financial, got to be profitable in the first instance.  And then, you know, beyond that, what sort of changes are we prepared to make?  I think Richard Leesk has a really good view on this because he's someone who got an Uffield scholarship last year and investigated regen ag and how it could be used in the wine industry.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:26:54):**  So kind of taking those various things and putting them into his industry.  So he has a winery in South Australia in McLaren Vale. And this is how he is looking at regen to solve some of the challenges that his industry has.  We know that we've got some challenges coming up around, whether it be market around herbicide or whether we've already got challenges around resistance to herbicide in vineyards.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:27:19):**  So that's not a feasible thing going forward. You know, if you don't have a plan B for that, you're going backwards.  And we know that cultivation isn't the answer either because it's costly.  Every time you do it, it's costing you money. And again, at 100 bucks a hectare, you can't go from one herbicide or two herbicides to three cultivation plants.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:27:38):**  Because it's costing you more money and it's doing more damage to your soil. So this is where the regen bit comes in for me.  Now, I just don't think we need to get tied up in the in the term too much.  If we're doing something that is beneficial for the landscape, I think we can all agree on that more plants, more diverse, more cover ticks a lot of boxes.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:27:59):**  That's better than less plants cultivation and bare ground.  I like your simple assessment.  The notes I have for Richard were questioning inquisitive pragmatist.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:28:10):**  I mean, it's just like I love the way that he's come at that.  I mean, you know what he said about herbicides, both from the kind of social license point of view, but also just the fact of multi herbicide resistance.  So, you know, that's great because there's two significant challenges that they're facing.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:28:28):**  So, yeah, I just love the kind of inquisitive but, you know, data driven approach that they're taking.  It gets me thinking, listening to all these clips, like how different their views actually are.  Like, I keep coming back to the fact that they're all saying they disagree with each other, but actually kind of saying the same thing.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:28:47):**  Like good business practices get closer to the consumer.  Don't do things that don't have evidence behind them prove that it's true, but you have to innovate in any business and get on with good practices.  That makes sense.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:29:01):**  And so I don't know, I keep thinking that they all don't actually disagree, but they keep emailing and texting me and saying how much who they align with and who they disagree with.  And so do the listeners.  So it is such a polarizing term, but at its foundations, I'm just not sure it's that different.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:29:16):**  Why do you think it is so polarizing?  Why is there so much emotion involved in regen ag?  And it seems to as soon as you say it, it just charges people up.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:29:25):**  I'd love to hear both of your opinions on that.  I think Will's point is a good one.  The value judgment that it places on it.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:29:32):**  And there's a regen good, not regen bad.  And if you don't subscribe to that label, then you're automatically a bad farmer.  And so I think that the term almost itself is polarizing and therefore there's some pushback to it.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:29:48):**  And I also think the lack of, there's no clear you have to do this, which I actually think is one of the benefits of regen over organic because it's more about the outcomes you want to achieve.  But in the current state or in, as we've talked about, we don't have the science to specifically say in these cases you do this and this is how you'll make more money and have better environmental outcomes.  We just don't know all of that information yet.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:30:10):**  So it is a bit squishy for those that want a more clear answer and then easy to poke holes in.  Yeah, it kind of feels like the flavor of the month.  That's been one of the big pushbacks is, oh, it used to be used to be cell grazing.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:30:22):**  It used to be organic and now it's regen and this is just the flavor of the month.  And until we get more rigor around it, just let it go.  It's another trend.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:30:31):**  So, Matthew, what's your reaction to all of this from an investor point of view?  Well, we've spent a fair bit of time talking about whether it is or is not and the degree to which it's motivating people to look at things differently or undertake different practices.  And I think from the investor point of view, that's where we get really interested.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:30:54):**  What are the current constraints that prevent people from moving in these directions and what might be the kind of innovations that will remove those constraints?  Actually, in Mark's thing, he talks, we mentioned, he said he wouldn't recommend it.  It was arduous.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:31:15):**  We don't want phrases like that used about products that are supposed to be enabling.  Investing is about working out how to replicate something that somebody's done lots and lots of times through delivery of a product or a service.  So that measurement and validation side, we see a really fertile area for investment there.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:31:36):**  There's a range of different approaches that are going to become relevant.  Clearly, satellite and remotely sense stuff is already being used, but as the precision and accuracy and spectral depth of those satellites improve, being combined with the ability to predict forward the application of statistical machine models and these sorts of things, a very big area.  There's a lot of chemical kind of compositions, so when you talk about soil and soil health and condition and carbon levels, how are they tested?  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:32:10):**  Wet chemistry where you're digging up soil and setting it off to a lab.  We see a lot of potential for change and disruption there, different ways of testing the chemical composition of things.  Then we talked also from the brand's point of view, how is it that we establish that what was supposed to have happened did happen?  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:32:32):**  We almost touched on organic a little bit.  This is one of the areas where I have a favourite phrase of saying that organic is the most disruptable brand on the planet.  It's mismatched in the exact same way that you pointed out.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:32:48):**  There's a lot of heavy lifting being done by the producer to get going.  The lifting that's done by the consumer is lifting up the package to look at a green label on the back.  The degree to which you can prove in any meaningful way that something that's supposed to be organic really is a bit limited in our digital world.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:33:10):**  When you think about all of those elements, it's just such a fertile area for investment.  Very exciting for us.  Toby Grogan from Impact Ag was also part of the meetup.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:33:21):**  They are natural capital specialists and asset managers.  He really took to that point, that defence of that point that Sarah made earlier about how Regen is often seen as the latest fad.  We're not a business that has appeared last week and decided we're Regen and we're going to save the world.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:33:42):**  We're a business that is built on a decade of data that demonstrates that we can, with lower inputs, certainly not no inputs, but lower inputs, with management change, increase productivity, increase returns.  The other thing I would say is from an investor point of view, the climate change and being able to invest, whether it's a small family investor that we deal with or a large corporate,  being able to invest their money into something that can demonstrate that it is a low impact or it is carbon positive investment is increasing exponentially.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:34:18):**  And as an industry, I think we are pretty well positioned to present ourselves as being a low carbon investment and in the best case scenarios, a carbon positive investment.  So Toby Grogan, they're really looking to the future.  How big an incentive do you think that will be, Matt, we'll start with you, in the next five, 10 years about having low carbon impact, about climate change, about having to prove those credentials should producers and people along the supply chain be thinking like that now?  
**[0:34:49-0:35:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:34:49):**  Well, Toby's, I thought the new point he introduced to our discussion today was the source of capital. So he specifically referred to the appetite amongst investors and we hear this continually, especially international investors interest in Australia is largely being driven by their interest in low impact and kind of climate positive solutions as they see them.  So that's an interesting conundrum, right? Because on the one hand is what are the sources of capital?  And then we've spent most of our time today talking about kind of the downstream side, what consumers think and how that drives.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:35:30):**  But increasingly those two things come together.  You know, the idea that farmers amongst many other things are the custodians of much of the natural capital and we've got to find ways that proper profitable incentives are created for the long term custodianship of that natural capital.  It kind of goes all the way back to the point of Sam and like new perspectives in this space, like we're seeing new capital want to come into agriculture driven by the opportunity to have climate resilience impact and climate change impact and drive the system towards outcomes they want to see.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:36:10):**  And we can push back and say, oh, but there isn't data or oh, but we don't know exactly how to do it yet. Or I guess we can say, like Jason, we don't exactly know how to get there, but we need rigor around what we can measure. We need to keep building those under underlying technologies.  And we can see this as a massive opportunity to shift the system in ways that consumers want and ways that are beneficial to producers and use it as a let's welcome these new perspectives and new sources of capital because it helps us drive to an outcome that I think in the end all of us really want to see.  I think from a producer perspective as well, Toby Grogan touches on this issue of inputs and he's sort of saying low inputs, you know, not no inputs and Will Bignall spoke to that as well, talking about how he uses all the inputs that you can get.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:37:00):**  And while he's into measuring soil carbon and doing other practices that look after the land, he is into inputs very much. How do we strike that balance, especially if you're starting on the road of regen?  I think that's probably a point for many farmers that they are fearful of trying to do something year after year with little or no inputs.  Yeah, actually one of the grabs from Mark, I think he used the phrase, kinder intensive production, which is an awesome way of saying the same thing, right, which is demonstrably using just the amount of resource that's needed.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:37:37):**  So, you know, to take fertilizer as an example, on the one hand, is it needed for soil function and for plant function and are we taking a careful approach about how we're applying it, like, you know, variable rate and modelling to know the right amount put down.  But also there are secondary concerns there too, which is can some of that run off? To what extent is it, you know, potentially also polluting waterways and other things like that?  There are multiple reasons for wanting to see lower intensity in inputs. So I think that's, you know, that's where we see the big trends, lower chemical intensity, so long as it's not compromising the long term viability of that as, you know, productive and sustainable land.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:38:26):**  Just seems like it's got to be good for everybody.  I love it because it goes beyond this temptation we all have as humans to just have it be black and white, like chemicals or no chemicals, regen or degenerative. And it's like, that's not how natural systems work.  And farmers more than anyone know that. And so whether we call it kinder intensive production or lower emissions intensity, it's that gray area that we have to all get comfortable with, because that's how nature works.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:38:50):**  Yes, there's always the greatest variable of every farmer's life, which is the weather, you know, and that impacts how things are going, you know, every day.  Matthew and Sarah, do you have any examples of success stories, whether it's from the technology side or from a corporate or startup side that has successfully employed an aspect of regen ag and is coming up with meaningful data, meaningful change  that, you know, can be seen right across a supply chain?  
**[0:39:22-0:39:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:39:22):**  Well, yeah, it depends a little bit on what sort of example that you mean, but I think we probably take a bit more of an enabling pathway approach to it.  So we talked a lot about chemical use, input use.  One of the big challenges that actually Richard talked about was not just consumer acceptance of levels of herbicide, but the fact that a lot of plants are becoming increasingly multi herbicide resistant.  
**[0:39:52-0:40:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:39:52):**  So the actual tool chest is kind of getting smaller. But then, you know, you think on the other side, when we start to look at autonomy, and you think about the ability for an autonomous vehicle to go out and deal with weeds, you know, swarm farm robotics can can send a platform out there and they can mechanically chip a weed.  Like if it crawls out there and has to spend all night going from one emerged weed to another and mechanically chipping it away, that's exactly what the platform is designed for.  I mean, one of the big announcements recently in Australia was the Soil Carbon Company.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:40:27):**  And that kind of opens up a whole space of upstream biological, microbial, biostimulant, like there's a whole world of alternative inputs, biological inputs and other approaches to pest disease nutrition management upstream that's getting a lot of attention and a lot of activity.  And I expect we'll continue to see that to give farmers more options for how they manage towards soil health and productivity.  I think we're going to have to wrap it up here. We've had so many insights from you both, Sarah and Matthew.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:41:00):**  I'd love to get just your final thoughts and your final observations or even a verdict on Regen Ag.  I know you, Sarah, you just said it's not black or white, but we'll start with you, Sarah.  Can you tell me what are your thoughts on Regen? You know, you've done a lot of work in the field.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:41:16):**  We've just had this series. Where is it at now and where is it going to head?  I wonder if regenerative will be the term that we use in the future, but I have no doubt that the trends will keep moving towards a things that consumers want and be having to prove that what practices we're doing and the outcomes we're having are true.  And so I think agriculture has one of the biggest benefits of any industry in the world in that consumers, the end consumer genuinely cares and increasingly cares about what's happening upstream.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:41:50):**  And the more we can tap into that and respond to it, the better relationship we have with our customer. It's kind of business 101.  And so it's really exciting whether it's called Regen or not is the ability to underpin that with proof and not just have it be a thing we say we do or a label we slap on there, but actually proving that the outcomes our end customers want are actually what we're doing and doing it profitably.  Matthew? Well, you kind of changed me that conflict, right? So I think I love Regen from maybe that perspective most of all is that it's encouraging a really good conversation sometimes degrades into kind of opinion and belief.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:42:29):**  But the more we can center the conversation around evidence, we just got to kind of keep trying to push the conversation into the center of saying, great, sounds plausible. Look forward to seeing the data.  Matthew Pryor, Sarah Nollet, thank you for joining us for the Regen wrap up. And thanks, Sarah, for letting me take over just for a day and sitting in the hot seat for once.  Awesome. It was fun.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/9/23/regen-ag-series-5-our-verdict#t=0:42:56):**  And that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What. Thank you for listening. If you like what you've heard, please give us a five star review and tell your friends. We finished our focus on Regen Ag, at least for now.  But we'll be back with an exciting new topic next episode to dig into more of the So What of Ag Tech. I'm Sarah Nollet. Catch you next time.

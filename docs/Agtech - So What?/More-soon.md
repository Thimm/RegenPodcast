### Agtech - So What?  (2018-25-27)
**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357336#t=0:00:00):**  Hey, Bush Tech listeners.  Sarah here.  With episode 26, I can't believe we have done 25 episodes so far.  And I just want to thank you so much for your support, for listening, for sharing the podcast,  for commenting on social media.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357336#t=0:00:15):**  And for those of you who have been guests, it's been really awesome.  After 25 episodes, Simon and I are really excited to take on board your feedback.  So we're going heads down for the next couple weeks to record more episodes, to find more  awesome guests, and to make some improvements in terms of our audio quality, in terms of  how we ask questions, the research we do beforehand.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357336#t=0:00:36):**  So have some exciting things coming up for you guys over the next couple weeks.  And we'd love to keep hearing your feedback, both on how we can do better, on what kinds  of guests we should be having, what kinds of questions we should be asking, and how  we can get the word out about Bush Tech.  So really appreciate all of your support so far.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357336#t=0:00:51):**  Keep the feedback recommendations and energy coming.  And until then, we'll see you in a couple weeks.  Thanks so much.

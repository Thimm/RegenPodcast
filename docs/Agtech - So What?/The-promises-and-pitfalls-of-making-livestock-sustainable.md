### Agtech - So What?  (2021-03-10)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Ag Tech So What, brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  I'm Sarah Nolet.  We often hear that there's a simple way to solve agriculture's contribution to climate  
**[0:00:12-0:00:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:12):**  change.  Just don't eat meat.  But that's certainly not the route our next two guests are taking in tackling the issue  
**[0:00:18-0:00:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:18):**  of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock.  I also have people who don't like me to work with agriculture.  They say, well, anybody who works with agriculture cannot be trusted.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:30):**  What are you talking about people?  What are you talking about?  Guess what you are eating?  
**[0:00:35-0:00:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:35):**  I don't care what you eat, whether you are a vegan or a carnivore or anything in between.  We all need food and guess who produces that?  That's Frank Mitloner.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:46):**  He's a professor at UC Davis and an air quality specialist who studies enteric emissions or,  well, cow burps.  He's developed quite a social media following by using his research to argue that the role  
**[0:00:58-0:01:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:58):**  of red meat in climate change, while real, is often way overblown and that the science  of how methane works in the atmosphere is often misunderstood.  You'll also hear from Carrie Ann Coker, CEO of Viteli, an ag tech startup using genetics  
**[0:01:13-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:13):**  to breed more feed efficient cows.  I think we've done a good job of really meeting the industry right where it's at on a really  important issue because we can't wait for the industry to consolidate, to take genetic  
**[0:01:25-0:01:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:25):**  progress into hands.  Both Frank and Carrie Ann in different ways are taking a producer led view and finding  answers through innovation.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:34):**  Let's start by getting to know Carrie Ann, who grew up on a farm in Iowa.  My first experience was I got to spray off the udder as my dad was knocking cows.  I was, I wasn't in school yet.  
**[0:01:45-0:02:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:45):**  And so that was really my first agriculture experience that I can remember.  And from there, the operation changed and evolved over my time at home.  And we eventually went into the dairy whole herd buyout, transitioned to more fed cattle,  
**[0:02:00-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:00):**  fed livestock in general, we had swine as well.  And then also brought some mama cows into the picture and always had diversified grain.  So corn, soybeans, hay, alfalfa, oats, etc.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:13):**  You know, sometimes you ask people how, you know, how they get into agriculture.  Well, I guess I never knew that I was out of it or in it.  To be honest with you, I always joke like, I didn't make the choice.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:24):**  I guess this is what it was.  I went to Iowa State University, which is the ag school there and in the state and majored  in agriculture education.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:33):**  So it just made sense that I would go into agriculture.  I just didn't know that there was other options out there.  And I have a true passion and love for it and always have.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:42):**  After college, Carrie Ann went into sales in animal health, or as she calls it, she  became a turkey drug dealer.  My first role was with Elanco Animal Health.  
**[0:02:52-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:52):**  So I sold medicines for turkeys, which is, there's probably five of us in the world that  have really done that at scale.  So it's a pretty niche part of the animal health industry, but spent three years doing  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:03):**  that.  Hilarious.  Even in Australia, I don't know that we have very many turkeys here.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:09):**  At least we don't eat many.  I don't think you do.  Yeah, it's a super niche market, you know?  
**[0:03:16-0:03:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:16):**  And I'm like, when I say to people, I was a turkey drug dealer.  I mean, there's, like I said, there's literally hardly anyone that has been able to say that  they've done that.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:24):**  But what's really kind of cool about it is that growing up in agriculture, I think you  can assume that you know a lot just because you've had lots of different experiences.  Well, not very many have had that kind of experience.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:35):**  So it forced me to really start from the ground up and be curious about how do you raise turkeys?  I don't know.  I've never seen this before.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:42):**  But you can see it at scale and at grand scale, you know, it's a fully integrated business.  The value chain is 100% integrated.  And so you've got to see a different part of agriculture in that role that I'm really  
**[0:03:53-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:53):**  grateful for because it really taught me right off the bat of like, you know nothing and  don't ever assume that you do.  It also taught Carrie-Anne to take a customer-centric view, which meant showing producers the economic  
**[0:04:05-0:04:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:05):**  value or ROI of animal health.  Because there's lots of players and I only had five customers, individual customers,  but had over 150 influencers to the five decisions that I needed to get in that role.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:20):**  So it really forced me to navigate the customer and the entire customer, I guess structure,  so that we could influence that decision.  And that I replicated that learning not only in turkeys, but I continued to move into swine  
**[0:04:35-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:35):**  and cattle and global swine and poultry on the broiler side, and then even into the cattle  and dairy industry.  And I think there's always opportunity to be more customer focused.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:46):**  I don't think we can ever be too customer focused.  And at that time when you were working those industries, was there this kind of same amount  of pressure on animal agriculture, I guess around whether it's antibiotics or greenhouse  
**[0:04:59-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:59):**  gas emissions, or you name any of these pressures?  Did you kind of feel that acutely in the work you were doing at that time?  Yeah, it's a great question because it's evolved significantly.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:10):**  But my very first product that I was responsible for selling was an ionophore antibiotic.  And one of the large poultry companies here in the United States were claiming that they  were antibiotics free.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:22):**  And that's the first time that they had really made a market claim that included or didn't  include a production practice, if you will.  And so that was a new trend that they were really trying out.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:36):**  Similar to, I mean, you've probably heard in poultry where they were making the claims  of no hormones.  Well, there's no hormones that have ever been approved for use in poultry, but yet every  
**[0:05:45-0:05:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:45):**  poultry package in the world says no hormones on it, right?  So this was taking the next step and taking that into antibiotics, which they thought,  you know, the company at the time thought that they were going to really gain a market  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:58):**  advantage.  They ended up getting sued and there was a huge lawsuit.  And so it really came to the forefront.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:05):**  And the product that I was selling at the time was right in the middle of it and a critical  product for production in poultry.  In fact, every bird that's raised in the world has coccidiosis and gets treated some way  
**[0:06:18-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:18):**  for it.  So it was a really critical health tool that producers needed.  And yet here we are like now starting to differentiate for the consumers demand or what would precede  
**[0:06:30-0:06:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:30):**  consumer demand was at the time.  You know, my 15 years, fast forward 15 years, I mean, we've taken it to a whole nother level,  you know, where we're looking at every production practice and how can we differentiate based  
**[0:06:42-0:06:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:42):**  on production practices.  And sometimes that's dangerous and sometimes it's a real opportunity.  So what does Carrie-Anne mean by that?  
**[0:06:51-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:51):**  Well, ever thought about how meat is being marketed to you?  These are intentional decisions by companies about what to put or not put on packaging.  Sometimes these decisions are genius, but other times they can backfire for the entire  
**[0:07:04-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:04):**  industry.  I think there's some things that you, the industry has chosen in general to not differentiate  or market differences on, for example, on food safety.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:17):**  That is one that you haven't seen a whole lot of differentiation.  My food is safer than your food.  My chicken is safer than your chicken.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:25):**  You don't see that.  And that's an unspoken agreement, right?  The truth of the matter is there's probably some that do it better than others, but they've  
**[0:07:33-0:07:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:33):**  agreed to not differentiate on that because that's bad for the whole.  When we come to different production practices where there's potential choices or a competitive  advantage that could be gained, whether you're using antibiotics or not using antibiotics  
**[0:07:45-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:45):**  or a production practice that allows for, I don't know, outdoor raising of pigs or indoor  raising of pigs.  I mean, those are all kind of niche choices that you can make, but I think the industry  
**[0:07:56-0:08:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:56):**  has learned that there's some things that you don't want to differentiate on.  And I think a great example of that is hormones.  In poultry, a company came out and said, we don't use hormones.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:08):**  Well, nobody uses hormones, right?  And so now everybody thinks that the chickens have hormones in it.  Well, that was a bad decision that hurt the entire industry.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:18):**  And a similar outcome would be if we started differentiating on things like food safety.  So I think the industry has learned from that and I think has been more thoughtful with  it.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:28):**  And I do feel that we're now on a path where we're really trying to meet real consumer  demand for these elements and not just trying to find a leg up for a short period of time.  These days, after 15 years working for large animal health companies, Carrie-Anne is in  
**[0:08:43-0:08:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:43):**  the thick of the startup world, working on bovine IVF and data capture and analytics  to unlock genetic improvements.  I think this is a great example though of where my passion lies as a customer.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:56):**  And I thought, well, wow, yeah, I hear you on that capability, but you have this one  over here.  And do you know that the two of them can be just this much more valuable to a producer  
**[0:09:05-0:09:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:05):**  and that customer insight or that customer nuance that I think that I really gained a  lot of experience in my time in animal health is just kind of in the forefront.  And it really allowed me to, I guess, ask those questions that created this opportunity.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:19):**  And it's just been a real ride for sure.  I'm sure.  So this kind of gets us back to the industry structure point you were speaking about before,  
**[0:09:27-0:09:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:27):**  where in some of the livestock industries, poultry, especially in NUSPINE to some degree  are incredibly integrated.  And so the ability to kind of pass through different changes, whether that's on the medicine  
**[0:09:39-0:09:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:39):**  side or whether that's animal health or genetics are much higher.  Whereas in cattle, that's not really true.  Maybe tell me about why it's so unique that you guys are this kind of integrated tech  
**[0:09:51-0:10:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:51):**  platform, even though the industry itself isn't as integrated.  Yeah, it's a great point.  So, just like you said, the poultry industry, the pork industry, the crop aquaculture, all  
**[0:10:03-0:10:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:03):**  major ag industries from a genetic point of view have a fairly tight or integrated kind  of genetic nucleuses that are really driving the genetic priorities for those industries.  And that's just not the case for the global cattle industry.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:18):**  So if we think about poultry, you have two major genetic companies that really are driving  genetic priorities.  And they have prioritized, for example, feed efficiency over many years.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:29):**  In fact, they've made 250% improvement in feed efficiency over the last 50 years.  So it's hard to believe that a chicken ate nearly as much as the cow does today to gain  the same amount of weight.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:41):**  And now today, it's five times less than that.  So it's pretty remarkable what genetics can do when you have a concerted priority for  the industry.  
**[0:10:51-0:11:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:51):**  The cattle industry, however, isn't really different.  And it really is driven by the structure of the industry.  And that structure is quite fragmented.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:00):**  You have a seed stock industry that's really focused on quote selling genetics.  But the genetics that they're selling are live animal genetics.  So we're talking about an industry that has historically relied on natural reproduction  
**[0:11:16-0:11:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:16):**  as the primary method of reproduction.  And it happens to have the longest life cycle ever.  So of all industries, cattle is the longest life cycle.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:25):**  So you combine just those two facts together, genetic progress is going to take you decades.  And so what we've been able to do in building the integrated technology platform is meet  the industry right where it's at.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:40):**  So we're not betting that the industry consolidates.  We're not betting that that is going to happen and allow for genetic progress to happen.  We needed to meet producers right where they are.  
**[0:11:54-0:12:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:54):**  And so what we've done is we brought three core capabilities together that are absolutely  critical in making genetic progress.  And we've made them accessible to all aspects of the value chain that really drive genetic  
**[0:12:07-0:12:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:07):**  gain.  So when we think about how genetic gain actually happens, we're talking about phenotype data  capture.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:14):**  So you've got to be able to select the right animals for reproduction.  You've got to do that with some level of accuracy.  And you need to shorten or speed up the genetic interval when possible.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:24):**  And so we've put together a phenotype data capture capability, coupled that with a genetic  analytic engine that allows us to do mating selection much more accurately.  And then we've lastly combined that with in vitro fertilization, which is the fastest  
**[0:12:39-0:12:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:39):**  reproduction method available in cattle.  So those three capabilities work together to really offer producers a faster way of  reproduction or genetic gain.  
**[0:12:50-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:50):**  And producers can choose one of them or they can choose all three, but all three will advance  the process for the entire industry every single time it's used.  And so I think we've done a good job of really meeting the industry right where it's at on  
**[0:13:04-0:13:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:04):**  a really important issue, because we can't wait for the industry to consolidate, to take  genetic progress into hands.  It's one of the most largest impacting effects that you can have on an industry over time.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:15):**  And we've seen that in every other species and every other part of agriculture that exists.  And can you maybe walk me through an example?  I don't know if you have a particular customer in mind that kind of brings that process to  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:28):**  life.  Yeah.  So I think a good example would be a seed stock producer.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:33):**  So their primary business is to sell, let's just say at the beef seed stock producer,  primary business is to sell bulls.  Bulls that are more feed efficient.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:43):**  And they get paid a premium when they sell more feed efficient genetics, they're bulls.  So they want to produce the most feed efficient bulls on the fewest number of cows, right?  That's like an efficient method for their business.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:56):**  So a couple of places where we interact, the first one is, well, how do we know if they're  feed efficient bulls?  And so we have a phenotype data capture system that allows us to measure feed intake and  
**[0:14:10-0:14:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:10):**  weight gain at scale in pen and collect that information kind of hands-free that really  allows us to identify the elite performing animals for the poor performing animals.  And what we see is just wide variation.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:24):**  So when we even select based on pedigree or history of an animal's performance or progeny,  performance of feed efficiency, we don't always get it right.  And so having information that allows us to select the elite performing animals is just  
**[0:14:41-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:41):**  critical.  And we see it, like I said, a huge variation, up to 25% variation of these individual animals  on how well they perform on feed efficiency.  
**[0:14:49-0:15:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:49):**  Well, that's significant.  And if you pick the wrong one, you're making a 10 year genetic decision.  And so that's one place that we interact with the producer that is selling feed stock bulls.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:00):**  The second thing is that they want to produce more bulls.  The more bulls they produce, the more opportunity they have for sale.  But they also, historically, more bulls equal more cows.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:11):**  Well, what we're able to do with in vitro fertilization is we're basically able to make,  after we've identified those elite animals, we're able to multiply that mating tenfold.  So almost like pigs, when you think about pigs and they're born in a litter, we can  
**[0:15:26-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:26):**  actually make a litter of cattle, right?  So out of one mating.  So instead of having one calf per cow, we can have 20, 30, 40, 50, however many you  
**[0:15:36-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:36):**  need that really allows us to replicate those genetics much faster.  And so that's another place that they'd interact.  And then the other thing is mating selection.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:45):**  How do we choose which cow to mate to which bull?  And that's where our genetic analytic engine comes in.  And we're able to take tools that the industry uses today, like phenotype data capture or  
**[0:15:59-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:59):**  pedigree or history or genomics, and we're able to combine all that information and do  an analysis that allows us to more accurately predict the outcome of genetics that genetics  will have on performance.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:14):**  And so that really is that accuracy piece that comes to play.  So we're able to kind of come into those three different spaces.  If that feedstock producer starts using IVF, we've made genetic progress.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:26):**  If they start using our phenotype data capture, they've made genetic progress.  If they use our genetic analytic engine and they become more accurate, they've made genetic  progress.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:35):**  If they use all three, they're going to make a heck of a lot more.  And so that's kind of how we can come into play for a feedstock producer.  Carrie-Anne has some pretty ambitious goals, but she argues that if enough producers focus  
**[0:16:46-0:16:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:46):**  on genetics, we can have both productivity and environmental benefits, like more feed-efficient  cows that then reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the industry.  But this is certainly not a silver bullet solution.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:57):**  It's just one of the emerging technologies, along with feed additives, changes to stocking  rates, and even biological controls.  But before we dive into more solutions, let's take a step back and understand the role that  
**[0:17:08-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:08):**  methane actually plays in global warming.  Here's Frank.  What people don't understand is that methane is different from other greenhouse gases.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:19):**  Different because methane is not just produced, but methane is also destroyed.  So there's a process in the atmosphere, in the air, that takes down methane in about  one decade.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:30):**  So the other greenhouse gases are only produced, but methane is not just produced, but also  destroyed.  And that changes the math around methane drastically.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:39):**  So it is true that livestock produces methane and other greenhouse gases, but as long as  the herds are constant, meaning as long as they don't increase and you don't have increasing  methane over time by growing your herd, let's say from a million to one and a half million  
**[0:17:58-0:18:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:58):**  or so, as long as you don't grow your herds, but have constant sources of methane, the  amount of methane produced and the amount of methane destroyed are in balance.  Meaning constant herds of livestock do not add, and this is now important, do not add  
**[0:18:14-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:14):**  additional methane to the atmosphere.  And hence they don't cause additional warming.  They do cause warming, but not additional warming.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:25):**  And tell me a little bit more about this destruction process.  So I think people are pretty familiar with the emitting process, but tell me more about  the destruction process.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:33):**  Okay.  So there's a molecule in the air called a radical, a hydroxyl radical.  So you find methane in the air and you find these radicals in the air.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:45):**  And these radicals, they take the hydrogen away from methane, converting it into CO2.  Methane chemically is CH4.  Methane is CH4.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:56):**  So that C is CH4 in the methane.  That carbon has an interesting past.  The methane carbon originates from the atmosphere.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:07):**  And here photosynthesis plays a role.  So what do plants need to grow?  Plants need sunlight.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:14):**  Plants need fertilizers.  Plants need water.  And plants need a source of carbon.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:21):**  The carbon is what these plants make carbohydrates from, like cellulose or starch.  Where does that carbon come from?  The carbon comes from the atmosphere in form of CO2.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:34):**  During photosynthesis, the plants take on CO2 from the air, suck it in, and convert  it into cellulose and into starch.  That carbon is now contained in the carbohydrate.  
**[0:19:48-0:20:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:48):**  A cow comes along, eats the plant material, and then a portion of that carbohydrate is  converted into methane gas.  So that's approximately 10% of the energy that an animal eats, that a ruminant eats,  
**[0:20:03-0:20:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:20:03):**  is converted into methane.  And then that methane is belched out, and some more methane is coming off the animal's manure.  Then that methane is in the air for 10 years, and during that time it meets a so-called  
**[0:20:19-0:20:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:20:19):**  hydroxyl radical.  That hydroxyl radical destroys the methane and converts it back into its original form, CO2.  So it is a carbon cycle, it is actually a short carbon cycle from atmospheric CO2 to  
**[0:20:37-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:20:37):**  plant carbohydrates such as cellulose and starch, to belch out methane or methane that  comes from the animal's manure, and then back into atmospheric CO2.  It then goes back into the atmospheric pool of CO2 from which plants can pull carbon again  
**[0:20:55-0:21:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:20:55):**  for photosynthesis.  So this is a short-lived carbon cycle.  It's called the biogenic carbon cycle.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:03):**  How is that different or similar to, let's say, the carbon that is generated when we  burn fossil fuels, such as oil, coal, and gas?  Well, it's actually very different.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:15):**  And the way it's different is that oil, coal, and gas, pure forms of carbon, were stored  in the ground for millions of years.  Originally, these were plants and animals, and hundreds of millions of years ago, these  
**[0:21:28-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:28):**  animals and plants died, they decayed, they fossilized, and that fossilized carbon was  then stored in the ground for a very long time.  Until 70 years ago, humans started extracting it from the ground.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:45):**  And up until today, we are at a point where we have extracted half of all fossil carbon  from the ground.  That's an enormous amount of carbon that we have dug out of the ground or pumped out of  
**[0:21:57-0:22:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:57):**  the ground, and what did we do with that carbon?  We burned it.  And every time we burn that carbon, we add new carbon, in this case, ancient carbon,  
**[0:22:08-0:22:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:08):**  to the existing stock that's already in our atmosphere.  So that is not a cycle.  That is a one-way street from the ground up into the air.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:17):**  So people comparing cows versus cars or so, most likely intentionally make that error.  In many cases, it's the same people who previously criticized animal agriculture on different  basis, basis of animal welfare, animal rights, blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:34):**  So now it's the climate.  Now this is a massively complex topic, not only the science, but also the politics and  really the whole system.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:43):**  And there are certainly other challenges with some forms of intensive livestock production,  like animal welfare.  But we're excited about a world with many forms of sustainable protein, including livestock.  
**[0:22:53-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:53):**  And so for this podcast, we're focusing on solutions to some of the challenges, like  ways to reduce emissions.  And Frank is all for reducing the emissions from cows.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:01):**  Much of his research is on how best to do this.  He's been looking at feed additives and certainly right now, seaweed and asparagopsis, largely  produced from Australia, is having its time in the sun.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:13):**  But Frank says, while there are some good options out there, there are several concerns  as well.  There are approximately 100 feed additives out there right now.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:26):**  Most of them are not commercially available, but various companies claim that these feed  additives have some kind of methane reducing function.  We have tested about 100.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:36):**  Of the 100, 95 we found not to be effective.  5 were effective, some more than others.  We found reductions anywhere from 10% methane reduction to well over 50, 60%.  
**[0:23:52-0:24:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:52):**  The most effective one was seaweed.  And that, I think, is a very interesting approach.  It has also some unintended consequences.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:02):**  Unfortunately, seaweed has some positives, which is a great effect on reducing the pathogens.  But the unintended consequence is that the active ingredient, bromoflur, is a well-known  carcinogen.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:17):**  And so we need to make sure that ingesting that will not have any negative impact on  either meat or milk of the animals that eat it.  Secondly, a big challenge is the palatability.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:31):**  Cattle don't like to eat it.  So if you want to get seaweed into cattle, then you have to kind of mix it into some  kind of molasses so that the animals will eat it.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:41):**  Because we've done trials with this and I can tell you they don't like it.  It might be the smell because when they approach this and they smell it, they will not touch  the feed.  
**[0:24:51-0:25:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:51):**  So we have been able to get it into them by putting it into molasses and so forth.  So palatability is the second challenge.  The third challenge is availability.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:01):**  So if I were to do a research trial and I were to need two tons of this stuff, it would  take an act of God to get it.  It's very difficult to receive at this point.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:11):**  And I'm not sure at what point it can be produced to scale to really achieve major reductions  of enteric methane in areas like the United States or Canada.  So we would have to have tens of thousands of tons of that stuff.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:28):**  And so how do we get that?  That's the next major challenge.  And so there are a couple of these challenges.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:35):**  There are other feed additives.  One of them is already available.  It's an essential oil.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:40):**  It's available on the market.  It doesn't reduce methane as much as asparagopsis, but it reduces methane by 10% and it has very  good effects on performance.  
**[0:25:52-0:26:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:52):**  So there are some options there.  You know, part of the challenge here is how do you actually measure what cows are producing  and how do you do the research around these kinds of products?  
**[0:26:02-0:26:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:02):**  So can you describe a little bit about the kind of process of capturing the methane data  and even maybe what this device looks like?  Yeah.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:10):**  So imagine a see-through head chamber, okay?  So a box that's made of plexiglass.  So it's see-through and it's large.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:20):**  And on the one side, you have a sleeve and the animal's head can go through the sleeve  and kind of sit snug around its neck.  The animal's head is inside the head box.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:31):**  So the cow can look out and see her buddies, which are also in the same predicament, so  to say.  And so they can see each other eating and drinking and they don't miss each other's  
**[0:26:44-0:26:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:44):**  company, so to say.  It's not that they are in a non-see-through kind of box.  They can look out and they don't seem to care, but they can't walk around with it.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:54):**  So they will have their head in the head box.  They can stand.  They can lie.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:59):**  They can eat.  They can drink at will.  And they can burp.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:02):**  And that's what we really want.  We want them to burp.  And that is then measured very precisely.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:09):**  We can measure just about any gas that comes off the digestive tract through the mouth.  These are head chambers, as I said, for enteric emissions.  I also have available to me large environmental chambers that are roughly the size of your  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:24):**  garage at home.  And they are totally sealed.  There's one air inlet, one air outlet.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:30):**  One coming here, we measure outgoing air.  And then last but not least, I have built very large buildings.  So they are about 30 meters long, 15 meters wide, and eight meters tall.  
**[0:27:46-0:28:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:46):**  And people call them the bovine bubbles.  And I have built eight of those.  So inside those bovine bubbles, I can have group housed cattle, 14 cattle per bovine  
**[0:28:01-0:28:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:01):**  bubble.  And here again, I have one air inlet and one air outlet.  And the animals can be in there for several months.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:09):**  And I can measure the emissions from animals, from animal manure, from animal feed, you  name it.  The only facility of its kind in the world that's also certified by the Food and Drug  
**[0:28:20-0:28:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:20):**  Administration of the United States as a facility to test feed additives.  As a professor, Frank doesn't have to worry about commercializing and scaling his findings.  It's about testing and finding what works.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:32):**  For Carrie-Anne, though, she needs both the science and the economics to be right to have  an impact.  We have to meet the triple challenge, which is we have to continue to have an industry  
**[0:28:42-0:28:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:42):**  that meets the global demand for protein.  We need to do it more sustainably and we need to do it where producers make money.  And so those three kind of mandates stood in front of us as we really developed the  
**[0:28:51-0:28:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:51):**  vision for Vitelle.  So as we think about greenhouse gas emissions, we think about the different factors that  really drive that.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:59):**  And feed efficiency is one of the key ones.  Yield, fertility are core components that really drive the impact that you can have  on emission intensity.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:10):**  And so when we think about R specially, we happen to have the largest phenotype database  in the world for feed efficiency and feed intake based on our phenotype data capture  tool that we have.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:23):**  And so we really sit at a place that allows us to be that priority setter for the cattle  industry and say, hey, here's what good looks like.  How do we meet that?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:34):**  We're able to use that data to help drive those mating selection decisions and bring  tools to producers that allow them to make those selections much better and much faster.  And so one of the, I guess, the kind of mantras that we have is we're looking to make genetic  
**[0:29:50-0:30:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:50):**  progress five times faster.  We're looking to have a over 30 percent improvement in feed efficiency over the next five years.  Today, the industry does about one percent a year.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:30:02):**  So we're looking to go five times faster than that, which results in a greenhouse gas emission  reduction of almost half a gigaton if we were applied to every single animal in our market,  which is a pretty significant and lasting impact that we can have on greenhouse gases.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:30:19):**  Now I think there's some practicality to that that needs to come into play.  And I think genetics is probably the most compounding, long lasting solution to really  getting some traction around producing more sustainable bees.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:30:37):**  One of the complaints we hear a lot in ag tech is that solutions aren't integrated.  They solve one part of the problem for a producer, but not all of it.  Carrie-Anne has spent a lot of time thinking about how to overcome this challenge.  
**[0:30:49-0:31:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:30:49):**  Yeah, I think we are a little bit on the leading edge of convergence here.  So like you said, there's a ton of tools that exist today that all will one, help you make  a reduction in greenhouse gases or improve feed efficiency or maybe even make genetic  
**[0:31:03-0:31:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:03):**  progress.  The bottom line is that they each come with their own individual value proposition.  They're not integrated.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:10):**  They're really hard to bring into actual producers production practices because they're independent  use cases, if you will.  We need to be integrated into one system that really allows us to one, meet producers where  
**[0:31:27-0:31:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:27):**  they are, but two, make this technology accessible and meaningful.  And so there's no doubt that if you choose IVF, that is going to be a faster way to reproduce  genetics.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:39):**  If you're reproducing bad genetics, you didn't make much progress.  So then that led us to, well, we've got to reproduce the right genetics.  Okay, so how do we decide the right genetics?  
**[0:31:49-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:49):**  Well, we need to pick out the right animals that we need to reproduce.  Well, that's phenotype data capture.  Okay, well now we have that.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:57):**  Well, how do we predict how they're going to perform?  Well, you need a genetic analytic engine.  And so that's how we came about this is thinking about it from a producer's perspective.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:07):**  At the end of the day, genetic decisions are high stake decisions for producers.  And if we really boil down, there's two decisions that producers make.  One, what is my mating selection?  
**[0:32:18-0:32:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:18):**  Which I breed them to?  And two, how should I get that done?  Mating selection and reproduction method.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:24):**  And we've said we need to be at the forefront of answering those two questions.  One challenge that comes with tackling such complex problems for both Carrie-Anne and  Frank is communicating about both the issues and the potential solutions.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:39):**  Methane and people did not understand that until recently, is not a super pollutant as  many describe it.  But methane is a super opportunity because if we manage to reduce it, it will decrease  
**[0:32:53-0:33:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:53):**  warming, it will decrease warming.  So any kind of methane reduction will have a very good impact on our climate.  So that puts animal agriculture, agriculture in general, along with forestry into the only  
**[0:33:10-0:33:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:33:10):**  categories of sectors of society that have the ability to not just produce but also reduce  greenhouse gases, be a thing.  So any reduction of methane will have a really good impact on our climate, whether that's  
**[0:33:28-0:33:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:33:28):**  through feed additives or dairy digesters, covered lagoons or composting or so.  All of these things can have a really advantageous effect in reducing methane, which leads to  negative warming, a fancy word for cooling.  
**[0:33:46-0:34:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:33:46):**  But in addition to that, if you have animals on pasture and you do it well, for example,  by using rotational grazing and so on, if you do it well and you increase the soil carbon  to a large extent, to a sizable extent, then that means you will trap a lot of atmospheric  
**[0:34:06-0:34:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:34:06):**  carbon in your soils.  And let's not forget this.  One third of all anthropogenic carbon that was produced through fossil fuel use and so  
**[0:34:16-0:34:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:34:16):**  on, one third of that is stored in our soils.  And who has control over soils?  It's forestry and it's agriculture.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:34:27):**  We need to incentivize farmers to invest into zero tillage, no tillage practices to make  sure that the carbon that's pulled into the ground stays there.  And I have to tell you that I'm very optimistic that our farmers are actually buying into  
**[0:34:44-0:35:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:34:44):**  it as soon as they understand what this is all about.  We have so many people who are so negative, so negative around farmers, particularly animal  agricultural farmers, that many farmers have turned their ears off and shut their eyes  
**[0:35:00-0:35:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:00):**  and said, we don't believe in any of this, leave us alone with that and so on.  That's very negative.  We need to turn the tides and need to educate farmers of what the opportunities are that  
**[0:35:11-0:35:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:11):**  they have and how we can use their skills in order to get the societal issue under control.  They can be a very significant solution provider.  Yeah, and one of the ways I guess to do this education and raise awareness of these solutions  
**[0:35:26-0:35:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:26):**  is through the research.  Another, of course, is through communications and social media, which is something that  you've been dabbling in more recently, growing your Twitter following especially.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:38):**  Can you tell me a little bit about how you got involved in speaking about this stuff  on social media and what that journey has been like?  I have to tell you, it's one thing to do research and publish in the period literature.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:51):**  Of course, I do that extensively.  It's very important to get grants, all of that.  That's the stuff that we do.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:57):**  But if that research that we do doesn't make it into the real world, then it's not really  of use to our society in the same way that I'm experiencing now.  After I really got involved in social media and educated farmers about what their true  
**[0:36:16-0:36:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:36:16):**  contributions are, and I'm very blunt about it, I tell them exactly what I find.  Sometimes they like it, sometimes they don't.  But at the end of the day, they're always appreciative of getting the real info because  
**[0:36:29-0:36:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:36:29):**  then they can make decisions that are based on facts and not based on some propaganda  or some myths that are out there in mass.  About one and a half years ago, I established a center here at UC Davis.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:36:45):**  It's called the Clear Center.  And I established that center because I wanted various stakeholders to learn more about the  environmental footprint of livestock and means of further reducing those impacts to the largest  
**[0:36:58-0:37:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:36:58):**  extent possible.  And we have a lot of impact.  A lot of impact.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:04):**  My Twitter account alone has about three million impressions a month, which for an academic  is quite sizable.  I'm not a musician or so, obviously, but I'm talking about livestock and environmental  
**[0:37:19-0:37:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:19):**  stuff and there's a lot of interest in that.  And how have you found that personally?  I'm sure you get positive support, obviously, with those followers, but maybe you also get  
**[0:37:27-0:37:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:27):**  some hate mail or pushback?  Yeah, I have to say that overall, the vast majority of interactions I have are very positive.  I get emails, I get tweets and some direct messages from places like yours, Australia,  
**[0:37:42-0:37:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:42):**  Canada, South Africa, Uruguay, all over the world.  I also have people who don't like me to work with agriculture.  They say, well, anybody who works with agriculture cannot be trusted.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:55):**  What are you talking about, people?  What are you talking about?  Guess what you're eating.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:01):**  I don't care what you eat, whether you are a vegan or a carnivore or anything in between.  We all need food and guess who produces that.  So how can people be resentful to scientists working with farmers, with the farming community,  
**[0:38:17-0:38:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:17):**  to get solutions done in that area?  How is that possible?  I can tell you, I've had some really negative interactions recently.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:28):**  One outlet that wrote a hit piece about not what I do and the research I do, but about  me personally.  And that's where I draw the line.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:37):**  I mean, if you don't like what I have to say or what I'm saying, you disagree scientifically  or so, say so.  But I'm not okay when attacks are going to this personal direction.  
**[0:38:51-0:39:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:51):**  That's just not okay.  There are people who try to blemish your reputation because they feel that you are in their way.  And that's just the way it is.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:02):**  For Carrie-Anne, you'd think explaining advanced genetics would be difficult.  And she says it is, except when it comes to speaking with producers.  When we talk to our customers, this is obvious.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:12):**  This is the game that they play and they're like, finally, this is a one stop shop that  can be meaningful.  And I want to see how this plays with this and this plays with that.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:21):**  And these are the decisions that they're making and it's so hard to make these decisions.  So when we go and talk to customers, it's just obvious.  And that's been the, I think that's an anchor point for me is that when it becomes un-obvious,  
**[0:39:34-0:39:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:34):**  then we got a whole other issue.  When it comes to the investors and I think other partners that we've made in the industry,  we have varying degrees of understanding of how these decisions are made today.  
**[0:39:47-0:40:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:47):**  And so it's a great opportunity to communicate and show how these decisions are made today  and how we can impact them.  So I think to your point, it can be as complex or as simple as you want to make it.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:40:00):**  At the end of the day, it takes a bull and a cow and you make a calf.  And if you pick the wrong bull and you pick the wrong cow, you're going to have a bad  calf.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:40:10):**  And that's a three year decision right there.  And so if I can impact those two decisions and shorten that time, it's just that simple.  And that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.

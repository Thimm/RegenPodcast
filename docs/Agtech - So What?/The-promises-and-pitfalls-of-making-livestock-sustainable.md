### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 19:01:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Ag Tech So What, brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:06):**  I'm Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:07):**  We often hear that there's a simple way to solve agriculture's contribution to climate  
**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:12):**  change.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:13):**  Just don't eat meat.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:14):**  But that's certainly not the route our next two guests are taking in tackling the issue  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:18):**  of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:21):**  I also have people who don't like me to work with agriculture.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:26):**  They say, well, anybody who works with agriculture cannot be trusted.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:30):**  What are you talking about people?  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:32):**  What are you talking about?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:34):**  Guess what you are eating?  
**[0:00:35-0:00:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:35):**  I don't care what you eat, whether you are a vegan or a carnivore or anything in between.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:41):**  We all need food and guess who produces that?  
**[0:00:45-0:00:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:45):**  That's Frank Mitloner.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:46):**  He's a professor at UC Davis and an air quality specialist who studies enteric emissions or,  
**[0:00:52-0:00:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:52):**  well, cow burps.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:53):**  He's developed quite a social media following by using his research to argue that the role  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:00:58):**  of red meat in climate change, while real, is often way overblown and that the science  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:04):**  of how methane works in the atmosphere is often misunderstood.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:08):**  You'll also hear from Carrie Ann Coker, CEO of Viteli, an ag tech startup using genetics  
**[0:01:13-0:01:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:13):**  to breed more feed efficient cows.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:15):**  I think we've done a good job of really meeting the industry right where it's at on a really  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:20):**  important issue because we can't wait for the industry to consolidate, to take genetic  
**[0:01:25-0:01:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:25):**  progress into hands.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:27):**  Both Frank and Carrie Ann in different ways are taking a producer led view and finding  
**[0:01:32-0:01:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:32):**  answers through innovation.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:34):**  Let's start by getting to know Carrie Ann, who grew up on a farm in Iowa.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:39):**  My first experience was I got to spray off the udder as my dad was knocking cows.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:44):**  I was, I wasn't in school yet.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:45):**  And so that was really my first agriculture experience that I can remember.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:49):**  And from there, the operation changed and evolved over my time at home.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:01:55):**  And we eventually went into the dairy whole herd buyout, transitioned to more fed cattle,  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:00):**  fed livestock in general, we had swine as well.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:04):**  And then also brought some mama cows into the picture and always had diversified grain.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:10):**  So corn, soybeans, hay, alfalfa, oats, etc.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:13):**  You know, sometimes you ask people how, you know, how they get into agriculture.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:16):**  Well, I guess I never knew that I was out of it or in it.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:21):**  To be honest with you, I always joke like, I didn't make the choice.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:24):**  I guess this is what it was.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:25):**  I went to Iowa State University, which is the ag school there and in the state and majored  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:32):**  in agriculture education.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:33):**  So it just made sense that I would go into agriculture.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:36):**  I just didn't know that there was other options out there.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:38):**  And I have a true passion and love for it and always have.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:42):**  After college, Carrie Ann went into sales in animal health, or as she calls it, she  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:46):**  became a turkey drug dealer.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:49):**  My first role was with Elanco Animal Health.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:52):**  So I sold medicines for turkeys, which is, there's probably five of us in the world that  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:57):**  have really done that at scale.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:02:59):**  So it's a pretty niche part of the animal health industry, but spent three years doing  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:03):**  that.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:04):**  Hilarious.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:05):**  Even in Australia, I don't know that we have very many turkeys here.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:09):**  At least we don't eat many.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:11):**  I don't think you do.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:12):**  Yeah, it's a super niche market, you know?  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:16):**  And I'm like, when I say to people, I was a turkey drug dealer.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:19):**  I mean, there's, like I said, there's literally hardly anyone that has been able to say that  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:23):**  they've done that.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:24):**  But what's really kind of cool about it is that growing up in agriculture, I think you  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:28):**  can assume that you know a lot just because you've had lots of different experiences.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:32):**  Well, not very many have had that kind of experience.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:35):**  So it forced me to really start from the ground up and be curious about how do you raise turkeys?  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:40):**  I don't know.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:41):**  I've never seen this before.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:42):**  But you can see it at scale and at grand scale, you know, it's a fully integrated business.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:46):**  The value chain is 100% integrated.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:48):**  And so you've got to see a different part of agriculture in that role that I'm really  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:53):**  grateful for because it really taught me right off the bat of like, you know nothing and  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:03:57):**  don't ever assume that you do.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:00):**  It also taught Carrie-Anne to take a customer-centric view, which meant showing producers the economic  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:05):**  value or ROI of animal health.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:07):**  Because there's lots of players and I only had five customers, individual customers,  
**[0:04:13-0:04:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:13):**  but had over 150 influencers to the five decisions that I needed to get in that role.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:20):**  So it really forced me to navigate the customer and the entire customer, I guess structure,  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:28):**  so that we could influence that decision.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:29):**  And that I replicated that learning not only in turkeys, but I continued to move into swine  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:35):**  and cattle and global swine and poultry on the broiler side, and then even into the cattle  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:41):**  and dairy industry.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:42):**  And I think there's always opportunity to be more customer focused.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:46):**  I don't think we can ever be too customer focused.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:49):**  And at that time when you were working those industries, was there this kind of same amount  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:54):**  of pressure on animal agriculture, I guess around whether it's antibiotics or greenhouse  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:04:59):**  gas emissions, or you name any of these pressures?  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:02):**  Did you kind of feel that acutely in the work you were doing at that time?  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:06):**  Yeah, it's a great question because it's evolved significantly.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:10):**  But my very first product that I was responsible for selling was an ionophore antibiotic.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:17):**  And one of the large poultry companies here in the United States were claiming that they  
**[0:05:21-0:05:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:21):**  were antibiotics free.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:22):**  And that's the first time that they had really made a market claim that included or didn't  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:30):**  include a production practice, if you will.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:33):**  And so that was a new trend that they were really trying out.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:36):**  Similar to, I mean, you've probably heard in poultry where they were making the claims  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:39):**  of no hormones.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:41):**  Well, there's no hormones that have ever been approved for use in poultry, but yet every  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:45):**  poultry package in the world says no hormones on it, right?  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:49):**  So this was taking the next step and taking that into antibiotics, which they thought,  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:54):**  you know, the company at the time thought that they were going to really gain a market  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:58):**  advantage.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:05:59):**  They ended up getting sued and there was a huge lawsuit.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:03):**  And so it really came to the forefront.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:05):**  And the product that I was selling at the time was right in the middle of it and a critical  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:10):**  product for production in poultry.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:12):**  In fact, every bird that's raised in the world has coccidiosis and gets treated some way  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:18):**  for it.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:19):**  So it was a really critical health tool that producers needed.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:23):**  And yet here we are like now starting to differentiate for the consumers demand or what would precede  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:30):**  consumer demand was at the time.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:32):**  You know, my 15 years, fast forward 15 years, I mean, we've taken it to a whole nother level,  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:37):**  you know, where we're looking at every production practice and how can we differentiate based  
**[0:06:42-0:06:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:42):**  on production practices.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:43):**  And sometimes that's dangerous and sometimes it's a real opportunity.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:48):**  So what does Carrie-Anne mean by that?  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:51):**  Well, ever thought about how meat is being marketed to you?  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:06:54):**  These are intentional decisions by companies about what to put or not put on packaging.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:00):**  Sometimes these decisions are genius, but other times they can backfire for the entire  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:04):**  industry.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:05):**  I think there's some things that you, the industry has chosen in general to not differentiate  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:12):**  or market differences on, for example, on food safety.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:17):**  That is one that you haven't seen a whole lot of differentiation.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:21):**  My food is safer than your food.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:24):**  My chicken is safer than your chicken.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:25):**  You don't see that.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:27):**  And that's an unspoken agreement, right?  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:29):**  The truth of the matter is there's probably some that do it better than others, but they've  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:33):**  agreed to not differentiate on that because that's bad for the whole.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:37):**  When we come to different production practices where there's potential choices or a competitive  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:41):**  advantage that could be gained, whether you're using antibiotics or not using antibiotics  
**[0:07:45-0:07:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:45):**  or a production practice that allows for, I don't know, outdoor raising of pigs or indoor  
**[0:07:52-0:07:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:52):**  raising of pigs.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:53):**  I mean, those are all kind of niche choices that you can make, but I think the industry  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:07:56):**  has learned that there's some things that you don't want to differentiate on.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:01):**  And I think a great example of that is hormones.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:04):**  In poultry, a company came out and said, we don't use hormones.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:08):**  Well, nobody uses hormones, right?  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:10):**  And so now everybody thinks that the chickens have hormones in it.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:14):**  Well, that was a bad decision that hurt the entire industry.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:18):**  And a similar outcome would be if we started differentiating on things like food safety.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:23):**  So I think the industry has learned from that and I think has been more thoughtful with  
**[0:08:27-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:27):**  it.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:28):**  And I do feel that we're now on a path where we're really trying to meet real consumer  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:33):**  demand for these elements and not just trying to find a leg up for a short period of time.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:39):**  These days, after 15 years working for large animal health companies, Carrie-Anne is in  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:43):**  the thick of the startup world, working on bovine IVF and data capture and analytics  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:47):**  to unlock genetic improvements.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:50):**  I think this is a great example though of where my passion lies as a customer.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:08:56):**  And I thought, well, wow, yeah, I hear you on that capability, but you have this one  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:00):**  over here.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:01):**  And do you know that the two of them can be just this much more valuable to a producer  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:05):**  and that customer insight or that customer nuance that I think that I really gained a  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:12):**  lot of experience in my time in animal health is just kind of in the forefront.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:15):**  And it really allowed me to, I guess, ask those questions that created this opportunity.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:19):**  And it's just been a real ride for sure.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:22):**  I'm sure.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:23):**  So this kind of gets us back to the industry structure point you were speaking about before,  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:27):**  where in some of the livestock industries, poultry, especially in NUSPINE to some degree  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:32):**  are incredibly integrated.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:34):**  And so the ability to kind of pass through different changes, whether that's on the medicine  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:39):**  side or whether that's animal health or genetics are much higher.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:44):**  Whereas in cattle, that's not really true.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:46):**  Maybe tell me about why it's so unique that you guys are this kind of integrated tech  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:51):**  platform, even though the industry itself isn't as integrated.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:55):**  Yeah, it's a great point.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:09:57):**  So, just like you said, the poultry industry, the pork industry, the crop aquaculture, all  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:03):**  major ag industries from a genetic point of view have a fairly tight or integrated kind  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:09):**  of genetic nucleuses that are really driving the genetic priorities for those industries.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:15):**  And that's just not the case for the global cattle industry.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:18):**  So if we think about poultry, you have two major genetic companies that really are driving  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:23):**  genetic priorities.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:25):**  And they have prioritized, for example, feed efficiency over many years.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:29):**  In fact, they've made 250% improvement in feed efficiency over the last 50 years.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:34):**  So it's hard to believe that a chicken ate nearly as much as the cow does today to gain  
**[0:10:39-0:10:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:39):**  the same amount of weight.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:41):**  And now today, it's five times less than that.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:44):**  So it's pretty remarkable what genetics can do when you have a concerted priority for  
**[0:10:50-0:10:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:50):**  the industry.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:51):**  The cattle industry, however, isn't really different.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:54):**  And it really is driven by the structure of the industry.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:10:57):**  And that structure is quite fragmented.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:00):**  You have a seed stock industry that's really focused on quote selling genetics.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:06):**  But the genetics that they're selling are live animal genetics.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:10):**  So we're talking about an industry that has historically relied on natural reproduction  
**[0:11:16-0:11:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:16):**  as the primary method of reproduction.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:19):**  And it happens to have the longest life cycle ever.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:22):**  So of all industries, cattle is the longest life cycle.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:25):**  So you combine just those two facts together, genetic progress is going to take you decades.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:32):**  And so what we've been able to do in building the integrated technology platform is meet  
**[0:11:38-0:11:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:38):**  the industry right where it's at.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:40):**  So we're not betting that the industry consolidates.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:44):**  We're not betting that that is going to happen and allow for genetic progress to happen.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:51):**  We needed to meet producers right where they are.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:54):**  And so what we've done is we brought three core capabilities together that are absolutely  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:11:58):**  critical in making genetic progress.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:01):**  And we've made them accessible to all aspects of the value chain that really drive genetic  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:07):**  gain.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:08):**  So when we think about how genetic gain actually happens, we're talking about phenotype data  
**[0:12:13-0:12:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:13):**  capture.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:14):**  So you've got to be able to select the right animals for reproduction.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:18):**  You've got to do that with some level of accuracy.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:20):**  And you need to shorten or speed up the genetic interval when possible.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:24):**  And so we've put together a phenotype data capture capability, coupled that with a genetic  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:30):**  analytic engine that allows us to do mating selection much more accurately.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:35):**  And then we've lastly combined that with in vitro fertilization, which is the fastest  
**[0:12:39-0:12:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:39):**  reproduction method available in cattle.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:41):**  So those three capabilities work together to really offer producers a faster way of  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:48):**  reproduction or genetic gain.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:50):**  And producers can choose one of them or they can choose all three, but all three will advance  
**[0:12:56-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:56):**  the process for the entire industry every single time it's used.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:12:59):**  And so I think we've done a good job of really meeting the industry right where it's at on  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:04):**  a really important issue, because we can't wait for the industry to consolidate, to take  
**[0:13:09-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:09):**  genetic progress into hands.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:10):**  It's one of the most largest impacting effects that you can have on an industry over time.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:15):**  And we've seen that in every other species and every other part of agriculture that exists.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:21):**  And can you maybe walk me through an example?  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:23):**  I don't know if you have a particular customer in mind that kind of brings that process to  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:28):**  life.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:30):**  So I think a good example would be a seed stock producer.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:33):**  So their primary business is to sell, let's just say at the beef seed stock producer,  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:37):**  primary business is to sell bulls.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:40):**  Bulls that are more feed efficient.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:43):**  And they get paid a premium when they sell more feed efficient genetics, they're bulls.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:47):**  So they want to produce the most feed efficient bulls on the fewest number of cows, right?  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:53):**  That's like an efficient method for their business.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:13:56):**  So a couple of places where we interact, the first one is, well, how do we know if they're  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:02):**  feed efficient bulls?  
**[0:14:03-0:14:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:03):**  And so we have a phenotype data capture system that allows us to measure feed intake and  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:10):**  weight gain at scale in pen and collect that information kind of hands-free that really  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:16):**  allows us to identify the elite performing animals for the poor performing animals.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:21):**  And what we see is just wide variation.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:24):**  So when we even select based on pedigree or history of an animal's performance or progeny,  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:32):**  performance of feed efficiency, we don't always get it right.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:36):**  And so having information that allows us to select the elite performing animals is just  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:41):**  critical.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:42):**  And we see it, like I said, a huge variation, up to 25% variation of these individual animals  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:47):**  on how well they perform on feed efficiency.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:49):**  Well, that's significant.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:51):**  And if you pick the wrong one, you're making a 10 year genetic decision.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:14:55):**  And so that's one place that we interact with the producer that is selling feed stock bulls.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:00):**  The second thing is that they want to produce more bulls.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:03):**  The more bulls they produce, the more opportunity they have for sale.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:07):**  But they also, historically, more bulls equal more cows.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:11):**  Well, what we're able to do with in vitro fertilization is we're basically able to make,  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:18):**  after we've identified those elite animals, we're able to multiply that mating tenfold.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:22):**  So almost like pigs, when you think about pigs and they're born in a litter, we can  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:26):**  actually make a litter of cattle, right?  
**[0:15:29-0:15:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:29):**  So out of one mating.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:31):**  So instead of having one calf per cow, we can have 20, 30, 40, 50, however many you  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:36):**  need that really allows us to replicate those genetics much faster.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:41):**  And so that's another place that they'd interact.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:43):**  And then the other thing is mating selection.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:45):**  How do we choose which cow to mate to which bull?  
**[0:15:50-0:15:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:50):**  And that's where our genetic analytic engine comes in.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:52):**  And we're able to take tools that the industry uses today, like phenotype data capture or  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:15:59):**  pedigree or history or genomics, and we're able to combine all that information and do  
**[0:16:06-0:16:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:06):**  an analysis that allows us to more accurately predict the outcome of genetics that genetics  
**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:13):**  will have on performance.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:14):**  And so that really is that accuracy piece that comes to play.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:18):**  So we're able to kind of come into those three different spaces.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:22):**  If that feedstock producer starts using IVF, we've made genetic progress.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:26):**  If they start using our phenotype data capture, they've made genetic progress.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:30):**  If they use our genetic analytic engine and they become more accurate, they've made genetic  
**[0:16:34-0:16:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:34):**  progress.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:35):**  If they use all three, they're going to make a heck of a lot more.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:37):**  And so that's kind of how we can come into play for a feedstock producer.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:42):**  Carrie-Anne has some pretty ambitious goals, but she argues that if enough producers focus  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:46):**  on genetics, we can have both productivity and environmental benefits, like more feed-efficient  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:51):**  cows that then reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the industry.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:55):**  But this is certainly not a silver bullet solution.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:16:57):**  It's just one of the emerging technologies, along with feed additives, changes to stocking  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:02):**  rates, and even biological controls.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:04):**  But before we dive into more solutions, let's take a step back and understand the role that  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:08):**  methane actually plays in global warming.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:11):**  Here's Frank.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:13):**  What people don't understand is that methane is different from other greenhouse gases.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:19):**  Different because methane is not just produced, but methane is also destroyed.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:24):**  So there's a process in the atmosphere, in the air, that takes down methane in about  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:29):**  one decade.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:30):**  So the other greenhouse gases are only produced, but methane is not just produced, but also  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:35):**  destroyed.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:36):**  And that changes the math around methane drastically.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:39):**  So it is true that livestock produces methane and other greenhouse gases, but as long as  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:46):**  the herds are constant, meaning as long as they don't increase and you don't have increasing  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:53):**  methane over time by growing your herd, let's say from a million to one and a half million  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:17:58):**  or so, as long as you don't grow your herds, but have constant sources of methane, the  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:03):**  amount of methane produced and the amount of methane destroyed are in balance.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:08):**  Meaning constant herds of livestock do not add, and this is now important, do not add  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:14):**  additional methane to the atmosphere.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:17):**  And hence they don't cause additional warming.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:20):**  They do cause warming, but not additional warming.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:25):**  And tell me a little bit more about this destruction process.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:27):**  So I think people are pretty familiar with the emitting process, but tell me more about  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:31):**  the destruction process.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:33):**  Okay.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:34):**  So there's a molecule in the air called a radical, a hydroxyl radical.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:40):**  So you find methane in the air and you find these radicals in the air.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:45):**  And these radicals, they take the hydrogen away from methane, converting it into CO2.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:52):**  Methane chemically is CH4.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:55):**  Methane is CH4.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:56):**  So that C is CH4 in the methane.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:18:58):**  That carbon has an interesting past.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:02):**  The methane carbon originates from the atmosphere.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:07):**  And here photosynthesis plays a role.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:10):**  So what do plants need to grow?  
**[0:19:12-0:19:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:12):**  Plants need sunlight.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:14):**  Plants need fertilizers.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:17):**  Plants need water.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:18):**  And plants need a source of carbon.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:21):**  The carbon is what these plants make carbohydrates from, like cellulose or starch.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:28):**  Where does that carbon come from?  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:29):**  The carbon comes from the atmosphere in form of CO2.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:34):**  During photosynthesis, the plants take on CO2 from the air, suck it in, and convert  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:41):**  it into cellulose and into starch.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:45):**  That carbon is now contained in the carbohydrate.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:48):**  A cow comes along, eats the plant material, and then a portion of that carbohydrate is  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:54):**  converted into methane gas.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:19:58):**  So that's approximately 10% of the energy that an animal eats, that a ruminant eats,  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:20:03):**  is converted into methane.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:20:05):**  And then that methane is belched out, and some more methane is coming off the animal's manure.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:20:13):**  Then that methane is in the air for 10 years, and during that time it meets a so-called  
**[0:20:19-0:20:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:20:19):**  hydroxyl radical.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:20:22):**  That hydroxyl radical destroys the methane and converts it back into its original form, CO2.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:20:30):**  So it is a carbon cycle, it is actually a short carbon cycle from atmospheric CO2 to  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:20:37):**  plant carbohydrates such as cellulose and starch, to belch out methane or methane that  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:20:44):**  comes from the animal's manure, and then back into atmospheric CO2.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:20:49):**  It then goes back into the atmospheric pool of CO2 from which plants can pull carbon again  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:20:55):**  for photosynthesis.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:20:57):**  So this is a short-lived carbon cycle.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:00):**  It's called the biogenic carbon cycle.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:03):**  How is that different or similar to, let's say, the carbon that is generated when we  
**[0:21:09-0:21:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:09):**  burn fossil fuels, such as oil, coal, and gas?  
**[0:21:12-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:12):**  Well, it's actually very different.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:15):**  And the way it's different is that oil, coal, and gas, pure forms of carbon, were stored  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:21):**  in the ground for millions of years.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:24):**  Originally, these were plants and animals, and hundreds of millions of years ago, these  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:28):**  animals and plants died, they decayed, they fossilized, and that fossilized carbon was  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:34):**  then stored in the ground for a very long time.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:38):**  Until 70 years ago, humans started extracting it from the ground.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:45):**  And up until today, we are at a point where we have extracted half of all fossil carbon  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:51):**  from the ground.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:52):**  That's an enormous amount of carbon that we have dug out of the ground or pumped out of  
**[0:21:57-0:22:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:21:57):**  the ground, and what did we do with that carbon?  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:00):**  We burned it.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:01):**  And every time we burn that carbon, we add new carbon, in this case, ancient carbon,  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:08):**  to the existing stock that's already in our atmosphere.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:11):**  So that is not a cycle.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:13):**  That is a one-way street from the ground up into the air.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:17):**  So people comparing cows versus cars or so, most likely intentionally make that error.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:24):**  In many cases, it's the same people who previously criticized animal agriculture on different  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:30):**  basis, basis of animal welfare, animal rights, blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:34):**  So now it's the climate.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:36):**  Now this is a massively complex topic, not only the science, but also the politics and  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:41):**  really the whole system.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:43):**  And there are certainly other challenges with some forms of intensive livestock production,  
**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:47):**  like animal welfare.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:48):**  But we're excited about a world with many forms of sustainable protein, including livestock.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:53):**  And so for this podcast, we're focusing on solutions to some of the challenges, like  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:56):**  ways to reduce emissions.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:22:58):**  And Frank is all for reducing the emissions from cows.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:01):**  Much of his research is on how best to do this.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:04):**  He's been looking at feed additives and certainly right now, seaweed and asparagopsis, largely  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:10):**  produced from Australia, is having its time in the sun.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:13):**  But Frank says, while there are some good options out there, there are several concerns  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:17):**  as well.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:18):**  There are approximately 100 feed additives out there right now.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:26):**  Most of them are not commercially available, but various companies claim that these feed  
**[0:23:31-0:23:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:31):**  additives have some kind of methane reducing function.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:34):**  We have tested about 100.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:36):**  Of the 100, 95 we found not to be effective.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:40):**  5 were effective, some more than others.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:45):**  We found reductions anywhere from 10% methane reduction to well over 50, 60%.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:52):**  The most effective one was seaweed.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:23:54):**  And that, I think, is a very interesting approach.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:00):**  It has also some unintended consequences.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:02):**  Unfortunately, seaweed has some positives, which is a great effect on reducing the pathogens.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:09):**  But the unintended consequence is that the active ingredient, bromoflur, is a well-known  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:16):**  carcinogen.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:17):**  And so we need to make sure that ingesting that will not have any negative impact on  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:22):**  either meat or milk of the animals that eat it.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:26):**  Secondly, a big challenge is the palatability.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:31):**  Cattle don't like to eat it.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:33):**  So if you want to get seaweed into cattle, then you have to kind of mix it into some  
**[0:24:38-0:24:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:38):**  kind of molasses so that the animals will eat it.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:41):**  Because we've done trials with this and I can tell you they don't like it.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:46):**  It might be the smell because when they approach this and they smell it, they will not touch  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:50):**  the feed.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:51):**  So we have been able to get it into them by putting it into molasses and so forth.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:56):**  So palatability is the second challenge.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:24:58):**  The third challenge is availability.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:01):**  So if I were to do a research trial and I were to need two tons of this stuff, it would  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:05):**  take an act of God to get it.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:07):**  It's very difficult to receive at this point.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:11):**  And I'm not sure at what point it can be produced to scale to really achieve major reductions  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:18):**  of enteric methane in areas like the United States or Canada.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:22):**  So we would have to have tens of thousands of tons of that stuff.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:28):**  And so how do we get that?  
**[0:25:29-0:25:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:29):**  That's the next major challenge.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:32):**  And so there are a couple of these challenges.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:35):**  There are other feed additives.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:37):**  One of them is already available.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:38):**  It's an essential oil.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:40):**  It's available on the market.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:42):**  It doesn't reduce methane as much as asparagopsis, but it reduces methane by 10% and it has very  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:50):**  good effects on performance.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:52):**  So there are some options there.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:54):**  You know, part of the challenge here is how do you actually measure what cows are producing  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:25:59):**  and how do you do the research around these kinds of products?  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:02):**  So can you describe a little bit about the kind of process of capturing the methane data  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:06):**  and even maybe what this device looks like?  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:10):**  So imagine a see-through head chamber, okay?  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:14):**  So a box that's made of plexiglass.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:17):**  So it's see-through and it's large.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:20):**  And on the one side, you have a sleeve and the animal's head can go through the sleeve  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:26):**  and kind of sit snug around its neck.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:29):**  The animal's head is inside the head box.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:31):**  So the cow can look out and see her buddies, which are also in the same predicament, so  
**[0:26:37-0:26:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:37):**  to say.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:38):**  And so they can see each other eating and drinking and they don't miss each other's  
**[0:26:44-0:26:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:44):**  company, so to say.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:45):**  It's not that they are in a non-see-through kind of box.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:49):**  They can look out and they don't seem to care, but they can't walk around with it.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:54):**  So they will have their head in the head box.  
**[0:26:57-0:26:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:57):**  They can stand.  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:58):**  They can lie.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:26:59):**  They can eat.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:00):**  They can drink at will.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:01):**  And they can burp.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:02):**  And that's what we really want.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:03):**  We want them to burp.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:06):**  And that is then measured very precisely.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:09):**  We can measure just about any gas that comes off the digestive tract through the mouth.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:15):**  These are head chambers, as I said, for enteric emissions.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:18):**  I also have available to me large environmental chambers that are roughly the size of your  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:24):**  garage at home.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:26):**  And they are totally sealed.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:27):**  There's one air inlet, one air outlet.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:30):**  One coming here, we measure outgoing air.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:32):**  And then last but not least, I have built very large buildings.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:37):**  So they are about 30 meters long, 15 meters wide, and eight meters tall.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:46):**  And people call them the bovine bubbles.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:51):**  And I have built eight of those.  
**[0:27:53-0:28:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:27:53):**  So inside those bovine bubbles, I can have group housed cattle, 14 cattle per bovine  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:01):**  bubble.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:02):**  And here again, I have one air inlet and one air outlet.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:06):**  And the animals can be in there for several months.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:09):**  And I can measure the emissions from animals, from animal manure, from animal feed, you  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:14):**  name it.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:15):**  The only facility of its kind in the world that's also certified by the Food and Drug  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:20):**  Administration of the United States as a facility to test feed additives.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:25):**  As a professor, Frank doesn't have to worry about commercializing and scaling his findings.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:30):**  It's about testing and finding what works.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:32):**  For Carrie-Anne, though, she needs both the science and the economics to be right to have  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:36):**  an impact.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:37):**  We have to meet the triple challenge, which is we have to continue to have an industry  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:42):**  that meets the global demand for protein.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:44):**  We need to do it more sustainably and we need to do it where producers make money.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:47):**  And so those three kind of mandates stood in front of us as we really developed the  
**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:51):**  vision for Vitelle.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:53):**  So as we think about greenhouse gas emissions, we think about the different factors that  
**[0:28:58-0:28:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:58):**  really drive that.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:28:59):**  And feed efficiency is one of the key ones.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:02):**  Yield, fertility are core components that really drive the impact that you can have  
**[0:29:08-0:29:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:08):**  on emission intensity.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:10):**  And so when we think about R specially, we happen to have the largest phenotype database  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:17):**  in the world for feed efficiency and feed intake based on our phenotype data capture  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:22):**  tool that we have.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:23):**  And so we really sit at a place that allows us to be that priority setter for the cattle  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:30):**  industry and say, hey, here's what good looks like.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:33):**  How do we meet that?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:34):**  We're able to use that data to help drive those mating selection decisions and bring  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:39):**  tools to producers that allow them to make those selections much better and much faster.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:44):**  And so one of the, I guess, the kind of mantras that we have is we're looking to make genetic  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:50):**  progress five times faster.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:52):**  We're looking to have a over 30 percent improvement in feed efficiency over the next five years.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:29:58):**  Today, the industry does about one percent a year.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:30:02):**  So we're looking to go five times faster than that, which results in a greenhouse gas emission  
**[0:30:06-0:30:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:30:06):**  reduction of almost half a gigaton if we were applied to every single animal in our market,  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:30:13):**  which is a pretty significant and lasting impact that we can have on greenhouse gases.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:30:19):**  Now I think there's some practicality to that that needs to come into play.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:30:23):**  And I think genetics is probably the most compounding, long lasting solution to really  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:30:31):**  getting some traction around producing more sustainable bees.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:30:37):**  One of the complaints we hear a lot in ag tech is that solutions aren't integrated.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:30:41):**  They solve one part of the problem for a producer, but not all of it.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:30:45):**  Carrie-Anne has spent a lot of time thinking about how to overcome this challenge.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:30:49):**  Yeah, I think we are a little bit on the leading edge of convergence here.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:30:53):**  So like you said, there's a ton of tools that exist today that all will one, help you make  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:30:59):**  a reduction in greenhouse gases or improve feed efficiency or maybe even make genetic  
**[0:31:03-0:31:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:03):**  progress.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:04):**  The bottom line is that they each come with their own individual value proposition.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:09):**  They're not integrated.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:10):**  They're really hard to bring into actual producers production practices because they're independent  
**[0:31:18-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:18):**  use cases, if you will.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:21):**  We need to be integrated into one system that really allows us to one, meet producers where  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:27):**  they are, but two, make this technology accessible and meaningful.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:32):**  And so there's no doubt that if you choose IVF, that is going to be a faster way to reproduce  
**[0:31:38-0:31:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:38):**  genetics.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:39):**  If you're reproducing bad genetics, you didn't make much progress.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:44):**  So then that led us to, well, we've got to reproduce the right genetics.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:47):**  Okay, so how do we decide the right genetics?  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:49):**  Well, we need to pick out the right animals that we need to reproduce.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:54):**  Well, that's phenotype data capture.  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:56):**  Okay, well now we have that.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:31:57):**  Well, how do we predict how they're going to perform?  
**[0:32:00-0:32:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:00):**  Well, you need a genetic analytic engine.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:01):**  And so that's how we came about this is thinking about it from a producer's perspective.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:07):**  At the end of the day, genetic decisions are high stake decisions for producers.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:12):**  And if we really boil down, there's two decisions that producers make.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:15):**  One, what is my mating selection?  
**[0:32:18-0:32:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:18):**  Which I breed them to?  
**[0:32:19-0:32:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:19):**  And two, how should I get that done?  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:21):**  Mating selection and reproduction method.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:24):**  And we've said we need to be at the forefront of answering those two questions.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:29):**  One challenge that comes with tackling such complex problems for both Carrie-Anne and  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:33):**  Frank is communicating about both the issues and the potential solutions.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:39):**  Methane and people did not understand that until recently, is not a super pollutant as  
**[0:32:45-0:32:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:45):**  many describe it.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:47):**  But methane is a super opportunity because if we manage to reduce it, it will decrease  
**[0:32:53-0:32:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:53):**  warming, it will decrease warming.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:32:56):**  So any kind of methane reduction will have a very good impact on our climate.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:33:03):**  So that puts animal agriculture, agriculture in general, along with forestry into the only  
**[0:33:10-0:33:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:33:10):**  categories of sectors of society that have the ability to not just produce but also reduce  
**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:33:20):**  greenhouse gases, be a thing.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:33:22):**  So any reduction of methane will have a really good impact on our climate, whether that's  
**[0:33:28-0:33:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:33:28):**  through feed additives or dairy digesters, covered lagoons or composting or so.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:33:36):**  All of these things can have a really advantageous effect in reducing methane, which leads to  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:33:42):**  negative warming, a fancy word for cooling.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:33:46):**  But in addition to that, if you have animals on pasture and you do it well, for example,  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:33:52):**  by using rotational grazing and so on, if you do it well and you increase the soil carbon  
**[0:33:58-0:34:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:33:58):**  to a large extent, to a sizable extent, then that means you will trap a lot of atmospheric  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:34:06):**  carbon in your soils.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:34:08):**  And let's not forget this.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:34:10):**  One third of all anthropogenic carbon that was produced through fossil fuel use and so  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:34:16):**  on, one third of that is stored in our soils.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:34:21):**  And who has control over soils?  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:34:24):**  It's forestry and it's agriculture.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:34:27):**  We need to incentivize farmers to invest into zero tillage, no tillage practices to make  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:34:35):**  sure that the carbon that's pulled into the ground stays there.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:34:39):**  And I have to tell you that I'm very optimistic that our farmers are actually buying into  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:34:44):**  it as soon as they understand what this is all about.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:34:48):**  We have so many people who are so negative, so negative around farmers, particularly animal  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:34:54):**  agricultural farmers, that many farmers have turned their ears off and shut their eyes  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:00):**  and said, we don't believe in any of this, leave us alone with that and so on.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:04):**  That's very negative.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:05):**  We need to turn the tides and need to educate farmers of what the opportunities are that  
**[0:35:11-0:35:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:11):**  they have and how we can use their skills in order to get the societal issue under control.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:18):**  They can be a very significant solution provider.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:21):**  Yeah, and one of the ways I guess to do this education and raise awareness of these solutions  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:26):**  is through the research.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:28):**  Another, of course, is through communications and social media, which is something that  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:33):**  you've been dabbling in more recently, growing your Twitter following especially.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:38):**  Can you tell me a little bit about how you got involved in speaking about this stuff  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:42):**  on social media and what that journey has been like?  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:46):**  I have to tell you, it's one thing to do research and publish in the period literature.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:51):**  Of course, I do that extensively.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:53):**  It's very important to get grants, all of that.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:55):**  That's the stuff that we do.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:35:57):**  But if that research that we do doesn't make it into the real world, then it's not really  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:36:04):**  of use to our society in the same way that I'm experiencing now.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:36:09):**  After I really got involved in social media and educated farmers about what their true  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:36:16):**  contributions are, and I'm very blunt about it, I tell them exactly what I find.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:36:21):**  Sometimes they like it, sometimes they don't.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:36:23):**  But at the end of the day, they're always appreciative of getting the real info because  
**[0:36:29-0:36:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:36:29):**  then they can make decisions that are based on facts and not based on some propaganda  
**[0:36:35-0:36:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:36:35):**  or some myths that are out there in mass.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:36:41):**  About one and a half years ago, I established a center here at UC Davis.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:36:45):**  It's called the Clear Center.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:36:47):**  And I established that center because I wanted various stakeholders to learn more about the  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:36:52):**  environmental footprint of livestock and means of further reducing those impacts to the largest  
**[0:36:58-0:37:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:36:58):**  extent possible.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:00):**  And we have a lot of impact.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:02):**  A lot of impact.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:04):**  My Twitter account alone has about three million impressions a month, which for an academic  
**[0:37:10-0:37:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:10):**  is quite sizable.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:12):**  I'm not a musician or so, obviously, but I'm talking about livestock and environmental  
**[0:37:19-0:37:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:19):**  stuff and there's a lot of interest in that.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:21):**  And how have you found that personally?  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:24):**  I'm sure you get positive support, obviously, with those followers, but maybe you also get  
**[0:37:27-0:37:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:27):**  some hate mail or pushback?  
**[0:37:30-0:37:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:30):**  Yeah, I have to say that overall, the vast majority of interactions I have are very positive.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:37):**  I get emails, I get tweets and some direct messages from places like yours, Australia,  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:42):**  Canada, South Africa, Uruguay, all over the world.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:46):**  I also have people who don't like me to work with agriculture.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:51):**  They say, well, anybody who works with agriculture cannot be trusted.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:55):**  What are you talking about, people?  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:58):**  What are you talking about?  
**[0:37:59-0:38:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:37:59):**  Guess what you're eating.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:01):**  I don't care what you eat, whether you are a vegan or a carnivore or anything in between.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:06):**  We all need food and guess who produces that.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:09):**  So how can people be resentful to scientists working with farmers, with the farming community,  
**[0:38:17-0:38:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:17):**  to get solutions done in that area?  
**[0:38:20-0:38:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:20):**  How is that possible?  
**[0:38:22-0:38:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:22):**  I can tell you, I've had some really negative interactions recently.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:28):**  One outlet that wrote a hit piece about not what I do and the research I do, but about  
**[0:38:33-0:38:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:33):**  me personally.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:36):**  And that's where I draw the line.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:37):**  I mean, if you don't like what I have to say or what I'm saying, you disagree scientifically  
**[0:38:43-0:38:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:43):**  or so, say so.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:45):**  But I'm not okay when attacks are going to this personal direction.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:51):**  That's just not okay.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:52):**  There are people who try to blemish your reputation because they feel that you are in their way.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:38:59):**  And that's just the way it is.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:02):**  For Carrie-Anne, you'd think explaining advanced genetics would be difficult.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:05):**  And she says it is, except when it comes to speaking with producers.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:09):**  When we talk to our customers, this is obvious.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:12):**  This is the game that they play and they're like, finally, this is a one stop shop that  
**[0:39:17-0:39:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:17):**  can be meaningful.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:18):**  And I want to see how this plays with this and this plays with that.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:21):**  And these are the decisions that they're making and it's so hard to make these decisions.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:26):**  So when we go and talk to customers, it's just obvious.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:29):**  And that's been the, I think that's an anchor point for me is that when it becomes un-obvious,  
**[0:39:34-0:39:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:34):**  then we got a whole other issue.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:35):**  When it comes to the investors and I think other partners that we've made in the industry,  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:43):**  we have varying degrees of understanding of how these decisions are made today.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:47):**  And so it's a great opportunity to communicate and show how these decisions are made today  
**[0:39:54-0:39:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:54):**  and how we can impact them.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:39:56):**  So I think to your point, it can be as complex or as simple as you want to make it.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:40:00):**  At the end of the day, it takes a bull and a cow and you make a calf.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:40:04):**  And if you pick the wrong bull and you pick the wrong cow, you're going to have a bad  
**[0:40:08-0:40:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:40:08):**  calf.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:40:10):**  And that's a three year decision right there.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:40:12):**  And so if I can impact those two decisions and shorten that time, it's just that simple.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/3/10/making-livestock-sustainable#t=0:40:21):**  And that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.

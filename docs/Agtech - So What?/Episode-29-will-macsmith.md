### Agtech - So What?  (2019-01-06)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly changing  the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting started.  But there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between ag and  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:00:35):**  ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring you the  story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where ag and tech  meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:00:59):**  Today my guest is Will McSmith, who is a farmer and also a bit of a tech entrepreneur. When  we spoke, he was in the middle of joining Youse and it was a convenient excuse, I think,  for him to come in and get out of the wind and have a chat with me. But I was really  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:01:13):**  grateful for him to take a break and do that. In the episode, we talk about his journey  into the tech world and some lessons he's learned from building technology that's solving  a problem for him on farm and trying to push the industry forward and what he's learned  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:01:29):**  and what challenges he's had in exploring that tech world. He also, at the end of the  episode, told me a great story. And so I had to switch on the recorder again and capture  that around adoption. And one of the things that gets talked about a lot is the different  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:01:44):**  age of farmers and what role that plays in technology adoption. So Will had a great story  about that as well. Without further ado, today's episode with Will McSmith.  Hey, Will, welcome to the podcast. Thanks for joining us.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:02:06):**  Thank you. Thanks for having me. So I'd love to start with a little bit of  your background and tell me a little bit about your farm.  Okay. So I grew up here on Family Farm and went to school in Orange and then I went over  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:02:29):**  to Canada for a year and worked on a grain cropping property over there and then came  back and went to UNE in Armidale and did a Bachelor of Agribusiness. And after that I  went up to Central Queensland and worked in a feedlot up there for AA Cove. I did a couple  
**[0:02:54-0:03:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:02:54):**  of stints up there and then came home for six months I suppose and then went back to  Emerald and worked on a grains research project up there for 18 months working for the Queensland  DPI. And then after that, I travelled for probably eight months overseas and then came  
**[0:03:21-0:03:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:03:21):**  back again home and have been home ever since and we had least some extra country when I  came home then. And so I've been home probably since probably 2009 I think. So yeah, nearly  10 years. All right. So a couple of questions there.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:03:41):**  What did you do on the feedlot? What kind of jobs did you have?  I did a stint on the livestock side, so the animal husbandry stuff, induction and penwriting,  those sort of things. And then did a stint in the feed crew as well, so everything to  
**[0:04:03-0:04:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:04:03):**  do with preparing feeds to bring them out. So yeah, it was a sort of, I think it was  about a 20,000 head feedlot at the time there, so it was quite a big setup and quite interesting  to see how it all was run.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:04:20):**  Yeah. When you were studying at UNE, did you know you kind of wanted to go into the feedlot  world? Did you know you wanted to do stuff in sheep or was it kind of a, it sounds like  you've done some stuff in cropping as well, like what were you certain of what you wanted  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:04:34):**  to do or were there a bit of indecision along the way?  I think there was plenty of indecision. I probably liked a lot of young guys. The cropping  side was more attractive maybe earlier on. We had a merino stud here at the time and  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:04:52):**  sheep certainly weren't really my interest then. So yeah, cropping's probably been a  big interest, but that filled a gap in some uni holidays when we didn't have any crop  to harvest. And then yeah, I just found it quite interesting trying to maximize the outputs  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:05:09):**  out of there by what they were doing with their controlled feeding. So it was interesting  just to be part of that at the ground level, I suppose, and just get a bit of an understanding  how the cattle side of things worked anyway.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:05:23):**  Yeah. So tell me about controlled feeding. You know me a bit in my naive questions here.  So what would the alternative be? Just putting stuff out there and not controlling amounts?  Is that the kind of difference?  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:05:37):**  I think they were playing around with timings a bit. And so it was bunk reading and that  was probably more just a management thing trying to give as much feed out as possible  without any wasteage sort of thing. So you were managing what their estimated intake  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:05:55):**  would be for a day and no more or no less type thing. But also just from a confined  feeding point of view, so obviously higher cost, having them on a total fed diet, so  minimizing the cost associated with that and maximizing the output. So trying to playing  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:06:12):**  around with different feeds, but also just trying to... It's quite tight margins, I suppose,  so it's making sure that everything's done as best as possible.  Yeah. And is there kind of technology involved in that? How does that actually get done in  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:06:28):**  practice? Are you weighing it? Or is there digital stuff? How does that work?  Yeah. So when I was there, they had just purchased, and this is a while ago now, I suppose, so  I'm sure there's a lot more done in the cattle stuff since then, but they were using batch  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:06:46):**  boxes then. So that was just an efficiency point of view for labor, but we were just  feeding in trucks every day into bunks. And so the feed was prepared on a daily basis,  steamflaked. So there's an efficiency in usage, I suppose, from managing the grain like that.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:07:06):**  But yeah, it was mainly about labor efficiency, I suppose, that they were really trying to,  I guess, get hold of at that point. Well, not mainly, but that's the part that I really  saw. They were just trying to make it as fast as possible to do the job and get the most  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:07:23):**  output from the cattle from what they were being fed.  Yeah. Interesting. And so you said some research in the grain space as well. What kind of research  were you doing or what kind of questions were you trying to answer?  
**[0:07:37-0:07:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:07:37):**  Yeah, so that was a local grains research project through Queensland DPI at the time  funded by GRDC. But it was a producer-driven group. There was, I think there was eight  separate groups within central Queensland. And each group, each sort of focus group,  
**[0:08:02-0:08:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:08:02):**  we would go to every few years, I think, and they would find the most relevant issues at  the time and then find a common theme amongst those groups and then undertake trial work  to help find solutions to those issues. So I was really producer-driven and I thought  
**[0:08:24-0:08:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:08:24):**  it was, I've kind of remembered that going forward in the stuff that we're doing now.  A lot of the big research stuff, while it's very interesting, there's probably a lot of  more pressing issues sometimes that farmers sort of like to think, oh, I'd like that,  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:08:47):**  but this is my bigger issue at the moment. So for them at a time when I was up there,  Feather Top Roads was a grass that started to become really difficult to control. And  so out of nowhere it became a real issue across all those groups. So we undertook trial work  
**[0:09:04-0:09:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:09:04):**  to sort of help write a best management practice on how to best control that. So it was really,  the producers were all seeing that issue and so we tried to find a solution for them for  that locally. And that, it doesn't really, it's not really an issue. It's not an issue  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:09:20):**  at all where we are here. So it was really focused as Central Queensland and those guys  up there, which was good because it helped quite quickly. You could find this is the  best way to deal with it and we could move on from there.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:09:34):**  Yeah, interesting. I think the challenge that the research organizations have and folks  like DPI is that balance of being kind of reactive to an issue that is happening right  now. Like how do you find a solution to something that's a big problem now versus like proactive  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:09:49):**  about the issue that's going to come up in the next two, three, five, 10 years? And how  do you kind of balance that, like those different timelines? I imagine that's really hard to  do, especially when something is pressing today. But if you don't kind of do the research  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:04):**  for the bigger things that are coming down the track, then you don't have those solutions  when those things become issues.  Yeah, definitely. I think they, yeah, I guess they both have to be run concurrently. While  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:17):**  your pressing issue is this grass, you can't lose sight of that there are bigger picture  issues that need to be maintained along the way too. So yeah, you don't want to get too  focused on one particular weed for one particular area that is only around for one particular  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:32):**  time of the year. And just completely write off everything else that's important. But  yeah, it was, it's the big issues that are definitely, you don't want to lose sight of  some of those sorts of things. And I guess the trial work for them runs probably longer  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:46):**  than some of the trial work we were doing on some of those shorter sort of issues.  Yeah. So you've spent a bit of time in Canada, you said, and then traveled a bit as well.  Any observations or anything you found interesting about different kind of production systems  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:11:01):**  overseas versus Australia? Did you bring any learnings back or anything on the other side  that you said, we're definitely not going to do that because we do it way better here?  From the cropping side in Canada, it's just the thing that I found really interesting  
**[0:11:18-0:11:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:11:18):**  for them is they were just, when you go, when the windows open, it's flat out until it's  done. And then when the next window opens, so if it was planning, as soon as you get  on the ground, you would go, it was such a short growing season from a time point of  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:11:35):**  view, but long days, we were quite a long way north. So everything happened, you just  finish sewing and turn around and spray everything. It's more staggered here and more controlled.  But in saying that, I think we've gotten to the point now when you have to take the opportunities  
**[0:11:53-0:12:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:11:53):**  for different reasons. Our rainfall was a lot more limiting than what they had at the  time up there. They had subsoil moisture coming out of winter, obviously, and so they would  have good planning conditions as soon as they could get on the ground. Whereas we've really  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:12:11):**  got a timing still really crucial here for us and making sure that as soon as the windows  open for something, we need to be able to go. So if that means starting all the way  back at harvest with residue management and making sure that we've got a good ground cover  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:12:26):**  and good water storage over our summer. So when I want to plant that crop, I can plant  it sort of thing. And within reason, obviously, if it doesn't rain, there's not a lot you  can do but giving yourself the best chance to get a crop away on time as soon as possible.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:12:43):**  Yeah, certainly that timeliness that they had, they had such small windows to get things  right and so when they were going, everything had to be perfect. So it was quite interesting.  It was just such a short period of time. It was from sort of, I think it was late April,  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:12:58):**  early May, and then sort of a month off in July sort of thing and then basically started  harvest after that and everything basically had to be done by, I think it was sort of  late October or you didn't get it off until the following year. So which I think looks  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:13:15):**  like this year they're having some trouble in the north. I think they're back on there  now but I saw some photos of canola in windrows that look pretty covered in snow. So it didn't  look fun. Yeah, and do you, when you say you saw some photos, was that on like social media?  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:13:31):**  Like do you kind of keep track of different farms overseas or do you have contacts there?  Like is that something you still kind of pay attention to on social media or how do you  do that? Yeah, I stay in touch with the guy I worked for over there but also I'm new to  
**[0:13:48-0:13:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:13:48):**  Twitter but I like seeing a lot of, those guys seem to just, maybe they've got so much  time in their machines they sit on Twitter taking photos but I do like seeing their crops  are so different than what we grow here, a lot of corn and soybeans and stuff so I find  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:14:08):**  it quite interesting and working out their yields and stuff for dry land sort of thing  that blows me away what they can grow. Those North American guys can grow on dry land crops  over there compared to what we could. Yeah, when they're wind about. Oh, go ahead. I was  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:14:27):**  watching some guys saying, oh it's the driest year ever, we've only had 22 inches or something  and that was for their growing season and I was thinking 22, we're at like what, six  maybe for the year? I don't know. Yeah, that's pretty crazy. I was gonna tease and ask if  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:14:43):**  you're one of those guys that's on Twitter as like an anonymous bot or whatever that  just follows people but you know we don't actually know who you are and don't know that  you're lurking around or are you actually participating? I'm a participant, very, I'm  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:15:00):**  more of an observer but I think the more, especially with the work that we're doing  now needs to be, like I think it's interesting to be part of and part of some of the conversations  that go on. Yeah, I think from the most part I see that it's quite interesting the sharing  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:15:16):**  of knowledge and people suggesting, oh you know someone poses a question and 20 random  people answer it and it's all different ways. Yeah, it's quite interesting. So I think I've  only been on for about two months so you can probably cut me some slack for being anonymous  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:15:31):**  at the moment. Alright, fair enough. So you mentioned a couple times what you guys are  up to now but tell us about that, kind of what's keeping you busy these days, where's  your head at? Yeah so I guess when I came home we had a strong cropping focus and last  
**[0:15:52-0:16:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:15:52):**  year our lease on a lot of the country we had ended and we'd sort of been ramping up  the livestock side again, our sheep side of things so and over that period of time we'd  been starting Hamish who's my business father who's Crown, he's an animal nutritionist and  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:16:15):**  I'm constantly asking questions about why, what about this, why not this. My sheep knowledge  was pretty limited and having a strong cropping focus you have a really good handle on inputs  and outputs to the dollar, to the egg, to the hectare, whatever it is and year on year.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:16:34):**  A lot of data and from our sheep side which is mainly wool is a lot of output data, like  we measure a lot of things, measure as much as we can but it's all output stuff we don't  really know aside from our operating costs what it costs to get that and feed being a  
**[0:16:57-0:17:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:16:57):**  huge part of that we're just making assumptions and about and even yeah so we started to think  about that and look into that a bit further and which sort of led on to us building a  facility I guess over a two-year period which measures individual feed intake and live weight  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:17:21):**  at the same time and that's all real time so every time an animal leaves the stall where  they feed from that piece of information gets sent to the cloud and allocated against that  individual animals tag number so it was sort of playing in that feed efficiency conversion  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:17:40):**  space at the moment and for a few reasons I mean there's a few aspects to that there's  feed I suppose so there's looking at better ways or different types of feed to feed and  then there's the environmental side which is what effect does shearing have on animal  
**[0:17:58-0:18:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:17:58):**  performance and intake production I suppose and then or water or heat and so we can look  at cost benefits of ways to manage that and then there's the genetic side which is okay  these animals are inherently more efficient let's select for them and try to reduce I  
**[0:18:18-0:18:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:18:18):**  guess our inputs and whilst maintaining you know or increasing our outputs I guess.  Right so take me back to the you know sort of seeing this problem or seeing that there  wasn't enough data to drive some of these decisions like that's makes sense that you  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:18:36):**  might observe that given your background but then the decision to go build a bunch of technology  and a whole system to measure this stuff like how did you make that decision I can imagine  just saying oh like I wish we knew it or someone else should do it or we'll see what kind of  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:18:49):**  techs out there like why did you decide to build it all yourself?  Yeah well I think the advent of GPS and smartphones sitting in tractors for as long as I was gives  you plenty of time to be able to think about things and look at things so we but we had  
**[0:19:07-0:19:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:19:07):**  sheep in the feedlot here and we would have varying levels of performance and and using  growth rate as an indicator for performance I thought was pretty flawed given it's growing  fast but what does that tell you it just tells you that it's you know it'll be gone sooner  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:19:25):**  but I don't know how much it's costing me to do that like it's it's performing better  but is it eating more to do that or is it is it more efficient in doing that so we we  looked at that and and also supplementing use and I guess the advent of well I was not  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:19:44):**  aware of a lot of the technology that's coming out and just started googling and playing  around and thought oh microcontrollers are cheap I'll buy some and see if I can hook  something together that'll that can measure these things so I'd looked into some units  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:20:00):**  for measuring feed efficiency and was blown away by the cost and went sort of thought  well nothing's going to get done if it's that expensive sort of thing to do it so we just  play I hooked up some some micro controls together and got the peripheral devices to  
**[0:20:18-0:20:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:20:18):**  do the basic job of what I was trying to do so and animals present yes readers tag yes  measure the feet type thing so we got the load cells and all those sort of things working  and then it got well beyond me and we got to go on board this sort of who managed to  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:20:39):**  get that process functional for us but I guess it really stems from the question that you  have animals in a phase lot and you have no idea how much they're eating and so what that  cost of gaining it's purely you can do it as a mob base but I wanted to know what the  
**[0:20:56-0:21:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:20:56):**  variation was within that and whether some of those you know we could select I guess  the bigger vision was if I set up a feedlot and I could set parameters for for cost of  gain that way I think it could be profitable every day of the year regardless of feed costs  
**[0:21:14-0:21:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:21:14):**  you might you might have less animals making the cut but I if I said if an animal's in  there it has to be growing at 250 grams a day for turnover and it has to be doing it  at a conversion of less than four to one which at those framers will make me $15 a head $20  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:21:36):**  head whatever it is but if you're comfortable with that profit margin per head then you  could you could comfortably finish lambs a percentage of those lambs that went into the  feedlot and then ones that didn't make that cut went back out on grass which was a lot  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:21:51):**  cheaper to finish them sort of thing so it was just looked at looking at trying to do  that probably. And how's it going have you been able to kind of crack that nut do you  get to just set the parameters and then go off and watch watch the magic work or is it  
**[0:22:07-0:22:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:22:07):**  still a bit of a work in progress? Yeah so the idea was good it's it's turned probably  so the system we've got up there at the moment's got 500 head capacity 80 individual stalls  in four pens at the moment we can split it up to eight pens but I think the cost of building  
**[0:22:31-0:22:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:22:31):**  that system at the moment probably outweighs the benefits gained from being able to make  a bigger margin per head by selecting those animals so until we can sort of get that system  cost down a little bit it'll probably be more research focused at the moment but it's certainly  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:22:51):**  currently as it is we could do what I'd set out to do but I don't think the benefits of  pure feedlotting at the moment would would justify having such an expensive system there.  Yeah and do you think that if you like you mentioned getting a guy in to help you could  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:23:09):**  you build it cheaper is it a expertise thing you know if you had sold this idea or concept  to a company that was expert in hardware and software do you think it would make the difference  or is it more just that the value proposition just really isn't there from an economic standpoint  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:23:24):**  yet?  It's probably a bit of both there I think the labor in the construction side of things  is is just a huge cost for us at the moment the steel isn't too bad the electronics aren't  
**[0:23:41-0:23:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:23:41):**  too bad but I think if it's per stall I think labor in the construction as in the welding  of those stalls and putting together of all that maybe makes up half of the total cost  so and that leaves you with steel, fencing, electronics, power it'll it's just a big cost  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:24:02):**  that we in Australia anyway we can't probably get around and I don't think that it's overly  expensive the way that we're getting it done at the moment it's just that's the cost of  getting things built in Australia I suppose so potentially if it was built on a larger  
**[0:24:18-0:24:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:24:18):**  scale we could we've run some scenarios now after having put bigger numbers of sheep through  and getting a better understanding of what the breakup is of animals that would make  the cut and whether that's enough to justify the expense and it's probably close I guess  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:24:37):**  the unknown is how much cheaper could we build it if it was built overseas probably which  is a bit of a shame to have to do that potentially but at the end of the day if you could make  it a lot more viable then it would be yeah there's so much information that can get captured  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:24:57):**  along the way too which benefits other things as well.  That's what I was going to ask about like have you talked to other producers or studs  or others that would want to kind of use this in different ways like for the data or you  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:25:09):**  mentioned genetics like are there other kind of ways that you could use this system to  help people out and maybe there's a business model in there for you is that something you've  looked at?  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:25:21):**  Yeah so probably currently at the moment there's a few different avenues of interest there's  feed companies who are looking at testing their products and variations of their own  products and competitors I guess so and so looking at performance improving we've just  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:25:39):**  done a trial for a feed company comparing two products so yeah there's certainly some  R&D stuff from the feed company side looking at improving performance and then there's  a lot of interest at the moment with the genetic side so either from breed societies or soil  
**[0:25:57-0:26:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:25:57):**  evaluation sites looking at the feed efficiency side of things and starting to gather some  sort of benchmarking data I guess to look at well where are we now and what does it  mean sort of thing so from a if I take it from a Marino point of view if I went and  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:26:18):**  selected or if I collected information on feed efficiency of my use where does that  sit for me given that or who am I comparing against which is probably nobody at the moment  but if we can do some soil evaluation sites and we get a lot of different size from a  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:26:37):**  lot of different parts around the country then you can start to get some data to go  okay well my sheep sit at this compared to this person and so we can then start to build  a database that then gives people more incentive to use it from a genetic point of view to  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:26:53):**  and I guess there's a little bit of an issue in the fact that it's just another trait that  needs to be measured along with a lot of them and it's not something that you'll purely  select for and then that becomes quite expensive trait to measure and how is that cost benefit  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:27:10):**  weighed up as well compared to something like safely swipe or micron which can be tested  really cheaply compared to feed efficiency I suppose yeah interesting so there's a lot  of startups and tech companies looking at the kind of individual animal measurement  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:27:27):**  and I'm curious like if you've are there other things out there that you've seen that kind  of look good that you could partner with work with or I mean you've obviously know the industry  and our producer yourself and so you've gone on this journey of really knowing and understanding  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:27:42):**  the problem whereas some of these startups maybe don't know the problem as well are they  is there stuff out there that's kind of targeting this area but missing the mark just too early  to tell like what's the kind of broader tech I guess landscape of solutions in this space  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:27:56):**  and is there anything kind of of interest yeah I think there's a lot out there at the  moment in terms well I guess there's a lot of software stuff being done and that I find  that really hard to know which one would suit me the best from a from a data capture point  
**[0:28:15-0:28:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:28:15):**  of view I suppose in terms of management stuff I guess that falls back under and I guess  only as good as the data you collect and I'm probably not the best person at manually collecting  a lot of data so if it was automatically collected then in that can become quite useful so then  
**[0:28:36-0:28:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:28:36):**  that comes back to the devices that can do that sort of stuff for you and so some of  the things we've seen maybe based around cameras or and using cameras more than just an image  using them to do more detailed work I suppose maybe we can ground truth them through our  
**[0:28:58-0:29:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:28:58):**  facility so if they're asking questions about animal behavior or something and you use the  camera and then we can actually track the actual that actual animal performance which  then you may be able to use cameras to detect animal behavior and say okay an animal that  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:29:14):**  behaves like this generally performs like this maybe maybe you know it's just an idea  but maybe some of those things that are being presented can be ground truth in the facility  like we've got but we're sort of in the process of expanding the the Wi-Fi capability across  
**[0:29:34-0:29:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:29:34):**  our place which will then facilitate like the internet we've only really had the NBN  for probably 18 months and that's just opened up a whole new bunch of opportunities for  us here and so being able to spread that across the place now I think then creates a heap  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:29:54):**  more opportunity for a lot of the emerging sort of tech stuff that seems to be coming  through.  Yeah, why do you think it is well that you like I talked to a lot of producers and you  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:30:05):**  know we hear this a lot that you know farmers are busy and they might have these problems  in the tech space but until there it's kind of a really clear return on investment you  know not going to go spend a bunch of time or money but it sounds like you you kind of  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:30:17):**  did the opposite like you didn't know if there'd be a return but you still went and have spent  a bunch of time and money on this why do you think that is that you've kind of wanted to  explore this space more even though it wasn't kind of clear exactly how it would end up.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:30:32):**  Yeah and I probably learned that that's probably not the best thing to do we're probably lucky  that yeah it's probably best to find out how solid that problem is before you actually  go and start building things but I guess the early part of it is inexpensive it's probably  
**[0:30:49-0:30:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:30:49):**  only my time that it fell under it's not not not you know when you can use microcontrollers  and weld your own things up it's it's not too expensive but yeah I guess we had we had  a pretty strong I guess we're relatively confident that it's an issue that needs some answers  
**[0:31:10-0:31:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:31:10):**  to and if we could I guess just build something small to give us some data to then know whether  so we built a system that was five stalls which is about we basically put about five  sheep per stall so pretty small capacity but straight away we were seeing the variation  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:31:31):**  within and thought geez there's something something in this wire some of these so far  one way in a performance point of view and or a cost of gain point of view and some so  far the other way so that sort of gave us a little bit to expand upon and then we also  
**[0:31:48-0:31:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:31:48):**  applied for some funding which we which we got with MLAs producer innovation fast rate  program so that's helped probably continue on with with a bigger scale I guess yeah and  so what do you what if anything would you do differently kind of knowing what you know  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:32:09):**  now and whether that's around like how you'd work with a software engineer or what you  would test first like what would you if anything do differently yeah I think I think what we're  saying before is you would really just test the market in terms of asking questions to  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:32:28):**  lots of people and people you don't know and really find out whether the issues that you  think an issue are actually issues for other people because which I have found out that  it's quite varying and something that you think is the biggest pain in the neck other  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:32:46):**  people couldn't care less about it so you can say you could save a whole lot of time  by just going and asking questions more than building something then going here what do  you reckon and they look at it and think no I don't need that so yeah definitely can yeah  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:33:05):**  just going out to people and and just chatting with them I mean I think we probably talk  to like-minded people so you all discuss the same sort of issues but it's within a closed  you know a small group I suppose so you don't really understand how big an issue that is  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:33:23):**  and then in different locations like geographic locations I suppose as well yeah yeah interesting  and so um you've also like this is potentially kind of a new business right this is crown  as opposed to the farm and you mentioned Hamish your business partner and another kind of  
**[0:33:40-0:33:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:33:40):**  engineer that's working with you is like what's the team dynamic like in that it's not a you  know a farming business it's kind of uncertain and things are changing and you know different  kinds of funding like what has it been like to kind of work in that space and have a team  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:33:56):**  kind of moving in the same or different directions managing a software engineer how have you  found that yeah it's been interesting and and completely different than what a family  farm operates like and I'm pretty autonomous I suppose it's just me and my father and we  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:34:15):**  just both know what needs to be done and yeah there's so that's been a pretty big learning  curve probably communications been a big thing too but it all it's been Hamish and I've been  friends for a long time as well and we both got probably different skill sets he's his  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:34:32):**  expertise sort of lies in the animal nutrition side and the data side of things so it really  helped sort of I'd come up with weird ideas and he'd say either say no that's been done  or or no that's not the issue this is the issue sort of thing so it was really helpful  
**[0:34:51-0:34:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:34:51):**  to go what about this what about this and then have somebody to sound off who actually  you know knew a lot more about animal nutrition and probably the sheep industry in general  than I did anyway so he's very strict on the data side of things and so and I'm probably  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:35:10):**  you know I like building things and so we've both built them together in the end I suppose  but I sort of I had the sheep and the space and to muck around with it in the early days  so it's probably worked quite well that we're different skill sets but it probably matches  
**[0:35:28-0:35:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:35:28):**  up quite well.  Yeah so when you think forward here I don't know 10 years or whatever well are you still  are you is this business exist and you're working on it have you started a different  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:35:39):**  tech business are you done with with tech you know businesses entirely like what do  you see for for the future in this space?  No I think it's been it's been really interesting because it's something that I knew nothing  
**[0:35:53-0:36:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:35:53):**  about and so being involved with sort of this and the MLA stuff has been so I think that  it's I've learned a lot about hardware versus software and where the value lies and what  is scalable and what's not scalable and so yes I'm definitely just as interested in the  
**[0:36:18-0:36:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:36:18):**  tech side of things as I was before I'm probably a bit more skeptical now and take my time  to evaluate whether I need things or not instead of just buying them and finding out that that  wasn't what I wanted and also I think I think at the end of the day what we have at the  
**[0:36:38-0:36:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:36:38):**  moment is is really useful for this point in time but with the technologies that are  evolving it will probably be superseded by something else so it's a matter of being involved  with that using that to maybe ground truth the next thing that does it faster cheaper  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:37:00):**  and make it more available to producers because of this at the scale that we're at and the  cost that we're at it's it's good to build some data but I'd like it to be just as widely  used as any other trait and so we probably need to come to a to another solution that  
**[0:37:19-0:37:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:37:19):**  can find those answers for us a lot cheaper and easier I guess just thinking about tech  adoption and how that relates to farmers I suppose there's you know I guess there's an  aging population of farmers or there's a lot of older guys that are farming that and so  
**[0:37:38-0:37:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:37:38):**  if I use my father as an example he's very interested in the tech side and watching what  we can do here and what we measure and how we can compare things but it's just that it  moves so fast that it's hard hard for them to keep up when you know maybe getting some  
**[0:37:56-0:38:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:37:56):**  guys to use a smartphone is enough sort of thing so it's just that even for myself and  probably the Twitter thing's a good example being every generation that is below you are  so much more computer savvy and tech savvy than the one probably that goes before them  
**[0:38:17-0:38:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:38:17):**  so it's just I think it's probably making it user friendly as possible or you're lucky  I guess if a farmer has a younger son who can embrace it understands it a lot easier  and can take it on because I don't think it's that potentially that they don't want it or  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:38:37):**  don't like it it's just how can they place it and be confident in using it I suppose.  Yeah I think that confidence point is such an important one because what I've seen or  found is is people getting like they can't even start or they don't want to start and  
**[0:38:52-0:38:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:38:52):**  so you really don't even have a way to have that conversation where it's like this could  do this or it could do this or how do we work on it it's like nah I'm not tech savvy like  I don't even want to try and I think that down to kind of confidence to have a go and  
**[0:39:05-0:39:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:05):**  you that you have enough base knowledge in how the smartphone works or how the software  works or whatever that you are willing to tinker around.  Yeah yeah and I think once they start you know if it starts with a smartphone and I  
**[0:39:17-0:39:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:17):**  guess phone service is probably an issue in a lot of areas too but provided you've got  reasonable phone service then I think once they get a handle on the smartphone then you  just you can step things up a little bit and continue on so I don't think that they're  
**[0:39:34-0:39:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:34):**  not capable it's just finding some where for them to start and and be able to then you  know take the steps to go okay I can do that now I'll do this and now I can use that to  do that so it's just building from the beginning and being able to understand how it all works  
**[0:39:52-0:39:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:52):**  getting the confidence to use it and then moving to the next thing.  Do you think that people would be interested in like some of these older farmers would  be interested in like a tech class like is there enough desire to learn about this stuff  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:40:04):**  that they would actually kind of come learn about it or because because I'm thinking about  it from the startup perspective where if you have to build this software and then you're  trying to get users on board and you want to get feedback and it's like well first they  
**[0:40:16-0:40:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:40:16):**  have to learn how to use the smartphone and then they got to get the internet and like  it's like oh my god I just go do something else like it's just too hard I'm wondering  is there like anything to kind of help I guess make this go faster or is it that the products  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:40:30):**  just aren't good enough yet that no one's gonna go spend time learning how to do it  until it's like I need to I need to get this app because it's so good.  Yeah I think it's probably a matter of one finding the really big issues like the main  
**[0:40:44-0:40:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:40:44):**  big issues that people and maybe if it's just data to add data recording that you know quite  simple to do once you get a handle on it and that's you know comes with a smartphone so  you if it's as simple as that I'm sure that you can then take it on and it's the things  
**[0:41:03-0:41:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:41:03):**  that we use all the time too so from a sheep point of view here we use like an auto drafter  which collects a lot of information so we've got an app that our sheep yards are connected  by Wi-Fi so as soon as we finished say weighing a mob of sheep that automatically gets emailed  
**[0:41:22-0:41:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:41:22):**  back to the office so that I can then go and analyze that data so they're not overly complex  things to do and I'm sure that they'd find them quite easily tied in with what like they  do as long as it's you know somebody just took the time to show them how they did it  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:41:41):**  and because they're such repetitive tasks so once you do it a few times then you're  doing the same thing every time it becomes a lot easier.  I think that's a really good reason why it's so important for people wanting to build technology  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:41:53):**  to come see the farm because once you've spent time and you're seeing like oh they're like  downloading this USB stick and then analyzing this data in the exact same way it's like  well we should just write some software to do that because that's easy but until you  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:42:06):**  see how painful it is you wouldn't know that that's even happening.  Yep yeah for sure yeah if you can just make that data transition a lot more seamless then  it makes it yeah not so clunky that I've got to plug the USB into this one then I've got  
**[0:42:22-0:42:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:42:22):**  to walk back to the house and then I've got to plug it into the computer there and then  that doesn't work so yeah if that data collection side of things is a lot more seamless yeah  it would make it I think it would make the uptake maybe a lot more and the same from  
**[0:42:38-0:42:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:42:38):**  the cropping side we had you know we were collecting yield data all the time but it's  what do you do with that information later on so I'm sure a lot of guys collect a lot  of older guys drive headers and collect a lot of yield data and it's just sitting on  
**[0:42:54-0:43:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:42:54):**  the storage of the header going I'm not sure where to use that sort of thing so.  Yep I think that's a like a joke that gets told like there's a lot of uptake of technology  but not a lot of kind of value coming from it especially in cases like that where yeah  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:43:11):**  it's on the header but they're not actually you know using it to make decisions or using  it using it to drive productivity and so is that really adoption or is that just kind  of default presence like.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:43:22):**  Yeah yeah and yeah like you say probably the best thing to do is get the tech guys to come  and just visit a whole different type of farms and see what they do and they're the people  that probably pick up because we do it day to day so we don't really take much notice  
**[0:43:43-0:43:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:43:43):**  of what what is annoying and what's not up you know you probably just that's the job  there's no other way to do it so we just do it that way and then they go they might look  at it and go why would you do it like that you can when you can do it like this and you  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:43:56):**  go and so you know the best thing yeah it's probably for them to see it and then they  can make that process a lot easier.  Yep well that sounds like a really good kind of call to action here for anyone listening  
**[0:44:11-0:44:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:44:11):**  to the podcast that if they have some ideas for work in this space it sounds like you're  pretty open to collaboration or you know finding ways to get more data and experiment in different  ways with the tech you've already built and the setup you guys already have so where can  
**[0:44:24-0:44:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:44:24):**  people find you how can they get in touch with you or how can they learn more about  what you're doing.  Yeah so we're called Crown Agriculture and probably email is the best way to get in touch  
**[0:44:37-0:44:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:44:37):**  or even just by phone so yeah it's just williamatcrownagriculture.com.au or you can get in touch with Hamish  who's hamishatcrownagriculture.com.au so that's probably the easiest way.  Yeah well we know they can't find you on Twitter because we don't respond to them.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:45:00):**  I'll make myself available on Twitter then.  Good well that's the win out of today then?  No I'm just kidding.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:45:08):**  Will thanks so much for joining us really fascinating love what you guys are up to and  hopefully some collaborations can come out of this I think you guys have built a really  strong base here lots of lessons learned for others thinking about kind of going on a similar  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:45:18):**  journey so hopefully there's some value there and looking forward to seeing how the system  turns out and what kinds of other businesses you guys can hopefully make work.  Yeah thanks for having me.

### Agtech - So What?  (Sun, 06 Jan 2019 07:50:26)
**[0:00:00-0:00:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to the AgTech So What podcast. Emerging technologies are rapidly changing  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:00:25):**  the global agricultural industry. We believe that this revolution is only getting started.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:00:30):**  But there's still too much hype out there and too big of a disconnect between ag and  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:00:35):**  ag tech. So on this show, we try to bridge that gap. In each episode, we bring you the  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:00:39):**  story of a different innovator in agriculture and try to find the place where ag and tech  
**[0:00:44-0:00:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:00:44):**  meet. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. Welcome back to the AgTech So What podcast.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:00:59):**  Today my guest is Will McSmith, who is a farmer and also a bit of a tech entrepreneur. When  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:01:05):**  we spoke, he was in the middle of joining Youse and it was a convenient excuse, I think,  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:01:09):**  for him to come in and get out of the wind and have a chat with me. But I was really  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:01:13):**  grateful for him to take a break and do that. In the episode, we talk about his journey  
**[0:01:18-0:01:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:01:18):**  into the tech world and some lessons he's learned from building technology that's solving  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:01:24):**  a problem for him on farm and trying to push the industry forward and what he's learned  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:01:29):**  and what challenges he's had in exploring that tech world. He also, at the end of the  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:01:35):**  episode, told me a great story. And so I had to switch on the recorder again and capture  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:01:39):**  that around adoption. And one of the things that gets talked about a lot is the different  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:01:44):**  age of farmers and what role that plays in technology adoption. So Will had a great story  
**[0:01:49-0:01:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:01:49):**  about that as well. Without further ado, today's episode with Will McSmith.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:01:56):**  Hey, Will, welcome to the podcast. Thanks for joining us.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:02:06):**  Thank you. Thanks for having me. So I'd love to start with a little bit of  
**[0:02:11-0:02:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:02:11):**  your background and tell me a little bit about your farm.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:02:17):**  Okay. So I grew up here on Family Farm and went to school in Orange and then I went over  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:02:29):**  to Canada for a year and worked on a grain cropping property over there and then came  
**[0:02:36-0:02:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:02:36):**  back and went to UNE in Armidale and did a Bachelor of Agribusiness. And after that I  
**[0:02:46-0:02:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:02:46):**  went up to Central Queensland and worked in a feedlot up there for AA Cove. I did a couple  
**[0:02:54-0:03:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:02:54):**  of stints up there and then came home for six months I suppose and then went back to  
**[0:03:04-0:03:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:03:04):**  Emerald and worked on a grains research project up there for 18 months working for the Queensland  
**[0:03:12-0:03:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:03:12):**  DPI. And then after that, I travelled for probably eight months overseas and then came  
**[0:03:21-0:03:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:03:21):**  back again home and have been home ever since and we had least some extra country when I  
**[0:03:28-0:03:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:03:28):**  came home then. And so I've been home probably since probably 2009 I think. So yeah, nearly  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:03:37):**  10 years. All right. So a couple of questions there.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:03:41):**  What did you do on the feedlot? What kind of jobs did you have?  
**[0:03:46-0:03:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:03:46):**  I did a stint on the livestock side, so the animal husbandry stuff, induction and penwriting,  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:03:57):**  those sort of things. And then did a stint in the feed crew as well, so everything to  
**[0:04:03-0:04:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:04:03):**  do with preparing feeds to bring them out. So yeah, it was a sort of, I think it was  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:04:11):**  about a 20,000 head feedlot at the time there, so it was quite a big setup and quite interesting  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:04:17):**  to see how it all was run.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:04:20):**  Yeah. When you were studying at UNE, did you know you kind of wanted to go into the feedlot  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:04:25):**  world? Did you know you wanted to do stuff in sheep or was it kind of a, it sounds like  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:04:30):**  you've done some stuff in cropping as well, like what were you certain of what you wanted  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:04:34):**  to do or were there a bit of indecision along the way?  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:04:39):**  I think there was plenty of indecision. I probably liked a lot of young guys. The cropping  
**[0:04:44-0:04:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:04:44):**  side was more attractive maybe earlier on. We had a merino stud here at the time and  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:04:52):**  sheep certainly weren't really my interest then. So yeah, cropping's probably been a  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:04:58):**  big interest, but that filled a gap in some uni holidays when we didn't have any crop  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:05:03):**  to harvest. And then yeah, I just found it quite interesting trying to maximize the outputs  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:05:09):**  out of there by what they were doing with their controlled feeding. So it was interesting  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:05:14):**  just to be part of that at the ground level, I suppose, and just get a bit of an understanding  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:05:20):**  how the cattle side of things worked anyway.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:05:23):**  Yeah. So tell me about controlled feeding. You know me a bit in my naive questions here.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:05:29):**  So what would the alternative be? Just putting stuff out there and not controlling amounts?  
**[0:05:34-0:05:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:05:34):**  Is that the kind of difference?  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:05:37):**  I think they were playing around with timings a bit. And so it was bunk reading and that  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:05:43):**  was probably more just a management thing trying to give as much feed out as possible  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:05:49):**  without any wasteage sort of thing. So you were managing what their estimated intake  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:05:55):**  would be for a day and no more or no less type thing. But also just from a confined  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:06:01):**  feeding point of view, so obviously higher cost, having them on a total fed diet, so  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:06:07):**  minimizing the cost associated with that and maximizing the output. So trying to playing  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:06:12):**  around with different feeds, but also just trying to... It's quite tight margins, I suppose,  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:06:18):**  so it's making sure that everything's done as best as possible.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:06:22):**  Yeah. And is there kind of technology involved in that? How does that actually get done in  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:06:28):**  practice? Are you weighing it? Or is there digital stuff? How does that work?  
**[0:06:34-0:06:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:06:34):**  Yeah. So when I was there, they had just purchased, and this is a while ago now, I suppose, so  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:06:41):**  I'm sure there's a lot more done in the cattle stuff since then, but they were using batch  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:06:46):**  boxes then. So that was just an efficiency point of view for labor, but we were just  
**[0:06:50-0:06:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:06:50):**  feeding in trucks every day into bunks. And so the feed was prepared on a daily basis,  
**[0:06:58-0:07:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:06:58):**  steamflaked. So there's an efficiency in usage, I suppose, from managing the grain like that.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:07:06):**  But yeah, it was mainly about labor efficiency, I suppose, that they were really trying to,  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:07:10):**  I guess, get hold of at that point. Well, not mainly, but that's the part that I really  
**[0:07:16-0:07:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:07:16):**  saw. They were just trying to make it as fast as possible to do the job and get the most  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:07:23):**  output from the cattle from what they were being fed.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:07:27):**  Yeah. Interesting. And so you said some research in the grain space as well. What kind of research  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:07:33):**  were you doing or what kind of questions were you trying to answer?  
**[0:07:37-0:07:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:07:37):**  Yeah, so that was a local grains research project through Queensland DPI at the time  
**[0:07:46-0:07:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:07:46):**  funded by GRDC. But it was a producer-driven group. There was, I think there was eight  
**[0:07:55-0:08:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:07:55):**  separate groups within central Queensland. And each group, each sort of focus group,  
**[0:08:02-0:08:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:08:02):**  we would go to every few years, I think, and they would find the most relevant issues at  
**[0:08:09-0:08:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:08:09):**  the time and then find a common theme amongst those groups and then undertake trial work  
**[0:08:16-0:08:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:08:16):**  to help find solutions to those issues. So I was really producer-driven and I thought  
**[0:08:24-0:08:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:08:24):**  it was, I've kind of remembered that going forward in the stuff that we're doing now.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:08:33):**  A lot of the big research stuff, while it's very interesting, there's probably a lot of  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:08:41):**  more pressing issues sometimes that farmers sort of like to think, oh, I'd like that,  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:08:47):**  but this is my bigger issue at the moment. So for them at a time when I was up there,  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:08:52):**  Feather Top Roads was a grass that started to become really difficult to control. And  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:08:58):**  so out of nowhere it became a real issue across all those groups. So we undertook trial work  
**[0:09:04-0:09:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:09:04):**  to sort of help write a best management practice on how to best control that. So it was really,  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:09:12):**  the producers were all seeing that issue and so we tried to find a solution for them for  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:09:16):**  that locally. And that, it doesn't really, it's not really an issue. It's not an issue  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:09:20):**  at all where we are here. So it was really focused as Central Queensland and those guys  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:09:26):**  up there, which was good because it helped quite quickly. You could find this is the  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:09:31):**  best way to deal with it and we could move on from there.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:09:34):**  Yeah, interesting. I think the challenge that the research organizations have and folks  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:09:39):**  like DPI is that balance of being kind of reactive to an issue that is happening right  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:09:44):**  now. Like how do you find a solution to something that's a big problem now versus like proactive  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:09:49):**  about the issue that's going to come up in the next two, three, five, 10 years? And how  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:09:54):**  do you kind of balance that, like those different timelines? I imagine that's really hard to  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:00):**  do, especially when something is pressing today. But if you don't kind of do the research  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:04):**  for the bigger things that are coming down the track, then you don't have those solutions  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:09):**  when those things become issues.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:11):**  Yeah, definitely. I think they, yeah, I guess they both have to be run concurrently. While  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:17):**  your pressing issue is this grass, you can't lose sight of that there are bigger picture  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:23):**  issues that need to be maintained along the way too. So yeah, you don't want to get too  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:27):**  focused on one particular weed for one particular area that is only around for one particular  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:32):**  time of the year. And just completely write off everything else that's important. But  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:36):**  yeah, it was, it's the big issues that are definitely, you don't want to lose sight of  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:42):**  some of those sorts of things. And I guess the trial work for them runs probably longer  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:46):**  than some of the trial work we were doing on some of those shorter sort of issues.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:51):**  Yeah. So you've spent a bit of time in Canada, you said, and then traveled a bit as well.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:10:56):**  Any observations or anything you found interesting about different kind of production systems  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:11:01):**  overseas versus Australia? Did you bring any learnings back or anything on the other side  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:11:07):**  that you said, we're definitely not going to do that because we do it way better here?  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:11:12):**  From the cropping side in Canada, it's just the thing that I found really interesting  
**[0:11:18-0:11:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:11:18):**  for them is they were just, when you go, when the windows open, it's flat out until it's  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:11:25):**  done. And then when the next window opens, so if it was planning, as soon as you get  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:11:29):**  on the ground, you would go, it was such a short growing season from a time point of  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:11:35):**  view, but long days, we were quite a long way north. So everything happened, you just  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:11:41):**  finish sewing and turn around and spray everything. It's more staggered here and more controlled.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:11:46):**  But in saying that, I think we've gotten to the point now when you have to take the opportunities  
**[0:11:53-0:12:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:11:53):**  for different reasons. Our rainfall was a lot more limiting than what they had at the  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:12:01):**  time up there. They had subsoil moisture coming out of winter, obviously, and so they would  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:12:06):**  have good planning conditions as soon as they could get on the ground. Whereas we've really  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:12:11):**  got a timing still really crucial here for us and making sure that as soon as the windows  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:12:17):**  open for something, we need to be able to go. So if that means starting all the way  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:12:22):**  back at harvest with residue management and making sure that we've got a good ground cover  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:12:26):**  and good water storage over our summer. So when I want to plant that crop, I can plant  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:12:32):**  it sort of thing. And within reason, obviously, if it doesn't rain, there's not a lot you  
**[0:12:36-0:12:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:12:36):**  can do but giving yourself the best chance to get a crop away on time as soon as possible.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:12:43):**  Yeah, certainly that timeliness that they had, they had such small windows to get things  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:12:47):**  right and so when they were going, everything had to be perfect. So it was quite interesting.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:12:53):**  It was just such a short period of time. It was from sort of, I think it was late April,  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:12:58):**  early May, and then sort of a month off in July sort of thing and then basically started  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:13:04):**  harvest after that and everything basically had to be done by, I think it was sort of  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:13:09):**  late October or you didn't get it off until the following year. So which I think looks  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:13:15):**  like this year they're having some trouble in the north. I think they're back on there  
**[0:13:19-0:13:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:13:19):**  now but I saw some photos of canola in windrows that look pretty covered in snow. So it didn't  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:13:26):**  look fun. Yeah, and do you, when you say you saw some photos, was that on like social media?  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:13:31):**  Like do you kind of keep track of different farms overseas or do you have contacts there?  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:13:36):**  Like is that something you still kind of pay attention to on social media or how do you  
**[0:13:40-0:13:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:13:40):**  do that? Yeah, I stay in touch with the guy I worked for over there but also I'm new to  
**[0:13:48-0:13:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:13:48):**  Twitter but I like seeing a lot of, those guys seem to just, maybe they've got so much  
**[0:13:56-0:14:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:13:56):**  time in their machines they sit on Twitter taking photos but I do like seeing their crops  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:14:03):**  are so different than what we grow here, a lot of corn and soybeans and stuff so I find  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:14:08):**  it quite interesting and working out their yields and stuff for dry land sort of thing  
**[0:14:12-0:14:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:14:12):**  that blows me away what they can grow. Those North American guys can grow on dry land crops  
**[0:14:19-0:14:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:14:19):**  over there compared to what we could. Yeah, when they're wind about. Oh, go ahead. I was  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:14:27):**  watching some guys saying, oh it's the driest year ever, we've only had 22 inches or something  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:14:31):**  and that was for their growing season and I was thinking 22, we're at like what, six  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:14:37):**  maybe for the year? I don't know. Yeah, that's pretty crazy. I was gonna tease and ask if  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:14:43):**  you're one of those guys that's on Twitter as like an anonymous bot or whatever that  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:14:47):**  just follows people but you know we don't actually know who you are and don't know that  
**[0:14:51-0:15:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:14:51):**  you're lurking around or are you actually participating? I'm a participant, very, I'm  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:15:00):**  more of an observer but I think the more, especially with the work that we're doing  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:15:04):**  now needs to be, like I think it's interesting to be part of and part of some of the conversations  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:15:09):**  that go on. Yeah, I think from the most part I see that it's quite interesting the sharing  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:15:16):**  of knowledge and people suggesting, oh you know someone poses a question and 20 random  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:15:21):**  people answer it and it's all different ways. Yeah, it's quite interesting. So I think I've  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:15:27):**  only been on for about two months so you can probably cut me some slack for being anonymous  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:15:31):**  at the moment. Alright, fair enough. So you mentioned a couple times what you guys are  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:15:36):**  up to now but tell us about that, kind of what's keeping you busy these days, where's  
**[0:15:41-0:15:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:15:41):**  your head at? Yeah so I guess when I came home we had a strong cropping focus and last  
**[0:15:52-0:16:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:15:52):**  year our lease on a lot of the country we had ended and we'd sort of been ramping up  
**[0:16:00-0:16:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:16:00):**  the livestock side again, our sheep side of things so and over that period of time we'd  
**[0:16:08-0:16:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:16:08):**  been starting Hamish who's my business father who's Crown, he's an animal nutritionist and  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:16:15):**  I'm constantly asking questions about why, what about this, why not this. My sheep knowledge  
**[0:16:20-0:16:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:16:20):**  was pretty limited and having a strong cropping focus you have a really good handle on inputs  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:16:28):**  and outputs to the dollar, to the egg, to the hectare, whatever it is and year on year.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:16:34):**  A lot of data and from our sheep side which is mainly wool is a lot of output data, like  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:16:44):**  we measure a lot of things, measure as much as we can but it's all output stuff we don't  
**[0:16:50-0:16:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:16:50):**  really know aside from our operating costs what it costs to get that and feed being a  
**[0:16:57-0:17:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:16:57):**  huge part of that we're just making assumptions and about and even yeah so we started to think  
**[0:17:05-0:17:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:17:05):**  about that and look into that a bit further and which sort of led on to us building a  
**[0:17:12-0:17:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:17:12):**  facility I guess over a two-year period which measures individual feed intake and live weight  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:17:21):**  at the same time and that's all real time so every time an animal leaves the stall where  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:17:26):**  they feed from that piece of information gets sent to the cloud and allocated against that  
**[0:17:32-0:17:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:17:32):**  individual animals tag number so it was sort of playing in that feed efficiency conversion  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:17:40):**  space at the moment and for a few reasons I mean there's a few aspects to that there's  
**[0:17:45-0:17:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:17:45):**  feed I suppose so there's looking at better ways or different types of feed to feed and  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:17:53):**  then there's the environmental side which is what effect does shearing have on animal  
**[0:17:58-0:18:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:17:58):**  performance and intake production I suppose and then or water or heat and so we can look  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:18:06):**  at cost benefits of ways to manage that and then there's the genetic side which is okay  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:18:12):**  these animals are inherently more efficient let's select for them and try to reduce I  
**[0:18:18-0:18:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:18:18):**  guess our inputs and whilst maintaining you know or increasing our outputs I guess.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:18:26):**  Right so take me back to the you know sort of seeing this problem or seeing that there  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:18:31):**  wasn't enough data to drive some of these decisions like that's makes sense that you  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:18:36):**  might observe that given your background but then the decision to go build a bunch of technology  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:18:41):**  and a whole system to measure this stuff like how did you make that decision I can imagine  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:18:45):**  just saying oh like I wish we knew it or someone else should do it or we'll see what kind of  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:18:49):**  techs out there like why did you decide to build it all yourself?  
**[0:18:54-0:19:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:18:54):**  Yeah well I think the advent of GPS and smartphones sitting in tractors for as long as I was gives  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:19:03):**  you plenty of time to be able to think about things and look at things so we but we had  
**[0:19:07-0:19:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:19:07):**  sheep in the feedlot here and we would have varying levels of performance and and using  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:19:14):**  growth rate as an indicator for performance I thought was pretty flawed given it's growing  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:19:20):**  fast but what does that tell you it just tells you that it's you know it'll be gone sooner  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:19:25):**  but I don't know how much it's costing me to do that like it's it's performing better  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:19:30):**  but is it eating more to do that or is it is it more efficient in doing that so we we  
**[0:19:34-0:19:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:19:34):**  looked at that and and also supplementing use and I guess the advent of well I was not  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:19:44):**  aware of a lot of the technology that's coming out and just started googling and playing  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:19:49):**  around and thought oh microcontrollers are cheap I'll buy some and see if I can hook  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:19:54):**  something together that'll that can measure these things so I'd looked into some units  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:20:00):**  for measuring feed efficiency and was blown away by the cost and went sort of thought  
**[0:20:04-0:20:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:20:04):**  well nothing's going to get done if it's that expensive sort of thing to do it so we just  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:20:13):**  play I hooked up some some micro controls together and got the peripheral devices to  
**[0:20:18-0:20:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:20:18):**  do the basic job of what I was trying to do so and animals present yes readers tag yes  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:20:27):**  measure the feet type thing so we got the load cells and all those sort of things working  
**[0:20:31-0:20:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:20:31):**  and then it got well beyond me and we got to go on board this sort of who managed to  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:20:39):**  get that process functional for us but I guess it really stems from the question that you  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:20:45):**  have animals in a phase lot and you have no idea how much they're eating and so what that  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:20:51):**  cost of gaining it's purely you can do it as a mob base but I wanted to know what the  
**[0:20:56-0:21:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:20:56):**  variation was within that and whether some of those you know we could select I guess  
**[0:21:03-0:21:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:21:03):**  the bigger vision was if I set up a feedlot and I could set parameters for for cost of  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:21:10):**  gain that way I think it could be profitable every day of the year regardless of feed costs  
**[0:21:14-0:21:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:21:14):**  you might you might have less animals making the cut but I if I said if an animal's in  
**[0:21:22-0:21:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:21:22):**  there it has to be growing at 250 grams a day for turnover and it has to be doing it  
**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:21:29):**  at a conversion of less than four to one which at those framers will make me $15 a head $20  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:21:36):**  head whatever it is but if you're comfortable with that profit margin per head then you  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:21:42):**  could you could comfortably finish lambs a percentage of those lambs that went into the  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:21:46):**  feedlot and then ones that didn't make that cut went back out on grass which was a lot  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:21:51):**  cheaper to finish them sort of thing so it was just looked at looking at trying to do  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:21:56):**  that probably. And how's it going have you been able to kind of crack that nut do you  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:22:01):**  get to just set the parameters and then go off and watch watch the magic work or is it  
**[0:22:07-0:22:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:22:07):**  still a bit of a work in progress? Yeah so the idea was good it's it's turned probably  
**[0:22:17-0:22:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:22:17):**  so the system we've got up there at the moment's got 500 head capacity 80 individual stalls  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:22:25):**  in four pens at the moment we can split it up to eight pens but I think the cost of building  
**[0:22:31-0:22:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:22:31):**  that system at the moment probably outweighs the benefits gained from being able to make  
**[0:22:37-0:22:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:22:37):**  a bigger margin per head by selecting those animals so until we can sort of get that system  
**[0:22:44-0:22:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:22:44):**  cost down a little bit it'll probably be more research focused at the moment but it's certainly  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:22:51):**  currently as it is we could do what I'd set out to do but I don't think the benefits of  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:22:57):**  pure feedlotting at the moment would would justify having such an expensive system there.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:23:03):**  Yeah and do you think that if you like you mentioned getting a guy in to help you could  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:23:09):**  you build it cheaper is it a expertise thing you know if you had sold this idea or concept  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:23:14):**  to a company that was expert in hardware and software do you think it would make the difference  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:23:20):**  or is it more just that the value proposition just really isn't there from an economic standpoint  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:23:24):**  yet?  
**[0:23:27-0:23:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:23:27):**  It's probably a bit of both there I think the labor in the construction side of things  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:23:35):**  is is just a huge cost for us at the moment the steel isn't too bad the electronics aren't  
**[0:23:41-0:23:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:23:41):**  too bad but I think if it's per stall I think labor in the construction as in the welding  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:23:48):**  of those stalls and putting together of all that maybe makes up half of the total cost  
**[0:23:54-0:24:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:23:54):**  so and that leaves you with steel, fencing, electronics, power it'll it's just a big cost  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:24:02):**  that we in Australia anyway we can't probably get around and I don't think that it's overly  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:24:08):**  expensive the way that we're getting it done at the moment it's just that's the cost of  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:24:12):**  getting things built in Australia I suppose so potentially if it was built on a larger  
**[0:24:18-0:24:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:24:18):**  scale we could we've run some scenarios now after having put bigger numbers of sheep through  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:24:25):**  and getting a better understanding of what the breakup is of animals that would make  
**[0:24:30-0:24:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:24:30):**  the cut and whether that's enough to justify the expense and it's probably close I guess  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:24:37):**  the unknown is how much cheaper could we build it if it was built overseas probably which  
**[0:24:43-0:24:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:24:43):**  is a bit of a shame to have to do that potentially but at the end of the day if you could make  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:24:51):**  it a lot more viable then it would be yeah there's so much information that can get captured  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:24:57):**  along the way too which benefits other things as well.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:25:02):**  That's what I was going to ask about like have you talked to other producers or studs  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:25:05):**  or others that would want to kind of use this in different ways like for the data or you  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:25:09):**  mentioned genetics like are there other kind of ways that you could use this system to  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:25:15):**  help people out and maybe there's a business model in there for you is that something you've  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:25:19):**  looked at?  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:25:21):**  Yeah so probably currently at the moment there's a few different avenues of interest there's  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:25:26):**  feed companies who are looking at testing their products and variations of their own  
**[0:25:32-0:25:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:25:32):**  products and competitors I guess so and so looking at performance improving we've just  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:25:39):**  done a trial for a feed company comparing two products so yeah there's certainly some  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:25:45):**  R&D stuff from the feed company side looking at improving performance and then there's  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:25:51):**  a lot of interest at the moment with the genetic side so either from breed societies or soil  
**[0:25:57-0:26:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:25:57):**  evaluation sites looking at the feed efficiency side of things and starting to gather some  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:26:08):**  sort of benchmarking data I guess to look at well where are we now and what does it  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:26:12):**  mean sort of thing so from a if I take it from a Marino point of view if I went and  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:26:18):**  selected or if I collected information on feed efficiency of my use where does that  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:26:25):**  sit for me given that or who am I comparing against which is probably nobody at the moment  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:26:31):**  but if we can do some soil evaluation sites and we get a lot of different size from a  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:26:37):**  lot of different parts around the country then you can start to get some data to go  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:26:41):**  okay well my sheep sit at this compared to this person and so we can then start to build  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:26:47):**  a database that then gives people more incentive to use it from a genetic point of view to  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:26:53):**  and I guess there's a little bit of an issue in the fact that it's just another trait that  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:26:57):**  needs to be measured along with a lot of them and it's not something that you'll purely  
**[0:27:02-0:27:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:27:02):**  select for and then that becomes quite expensive trait to measure and how is that cost benefit  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:27:10):**  weighed up as well compared to something like safely swipe or micron which can be tested  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:27:16):**  really cheaply compared to feed efficiency I suppose yeah interesting so there's a lot  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:27:22):**  of startups and tech companies looking at the kind of individual animal measurement  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:27:27):**  and I'm curious like if you've are there other things out there that you've seen that kind  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:27:32):**  of look good that you could partner with work with or I mean you've obviously know the industry  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:27:38):**  and our producer yourself and so you've gone on this journey of really knowing and understanding  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:27:42):**  the problem whereas some of these startups maybe don't know the problem as well are they  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:27:46):**  is there stuff out there that's kind of targeting this area but missing the mark just too early  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:27:51):**  to tell like what's the kind of broader tech I guess landscape of solutions in this space  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:27:56):**  and is there anything kind of of interest yeah I think there's a lot out there at the  
**[0:28:02-0:28:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:28:02):**  moment in terms well I guess there's a lot of software stuff being done and that I find  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:28:09):**  that really hard to know which one would suit me the best from a from a data capture point  
**[0:28:15-0:28:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:28:15):**  of view I suppose in terms of management stuff I guess that falls back under and I guess  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:28:23):**  only as good as the data you collect and I'm probably not the best person at manually collecting  
**[0:28:27-0:28:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:28:27):**  a lot of data so if it was automatically collected then in that can become quite useful so then  
**[0:28:36-0:28:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:28:36):**  that comes back to the devices that can do that sort of stuff for you and so some of  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:28:44):**  the things we've seen maybe based around cameras or and using cameras more than just an image  
**[0:28:49-0:28:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:28:49):**  using them to do more detailed work I suppose maybe we can ground truth them through our  
**[0:28:58-0:29:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:28:58):**  facility so if they're asking questions about animal behavior or something and you use the  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:29:05):**  camera and then we can actually track the actual that actual animal performance which  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:29:09):**  then you may be able to use cameras to detect animal behavior and say okay an animal that  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:29:14):**  behaves like this generally performs like this maybe maybe you know it's just an idea  
**[0:29:20-0:29:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:29:20):**  but maybe some of those things that are being presented can be ground truth in the facility  
**[0:29:26-0:29:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:29:26):**  like we've got but we're sort of in the process of expanding the the Wi-Fi capability across  
**[0:29:34-0:29:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:29:34):**  our place which will then facilitate like the internet we've only really had the NBN  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:29:41):**  for probably 18 months and that's just opened up a whole new bunch of opportunities for  
**[0:29:47-0:29:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:29:47):**  us here and so being able to spread that across the place now I think then creates a heap  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:29:54):**  more opportunity for a lot of the emerging sort of tech stuff that seems to be coming  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:29:59):**  through.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:30:00):**  Yeah, why do you think it is well that you like I talked to a lot of producers and you  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:30:05):**  know we hear this a lot that you know farmers are busy and they might have these problems  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:30:09):**  in the tech space but until there it's kind of a really clear return on investment you  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:30:14):**  know not going to go spend a bunch of time or money but it sounds like you you kind of  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:30:17):**  did the opposite like you didn't know if there'd be a return but you still went and have spent  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:30:21):**  a bunch of time and money on this why do you think that is that you've kind of wanted to  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:30:26):**  explore this space more even though it wasn't kind of clear exactly how it would end up.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:30:32):**  Yeah and I probably learned that that's probably not the best thing to do we're probably lucky  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:30:36):**  that yeah it's probably best to find out how solid that problem is before you actually  
**[0:30:42-0:30:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:30:42):**  go and start building things but I guess the early part of it is inexpensive it's probably  
**[0:30:49-0:30:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:30:49):**  only my time that it fell under it's not not not you know when you can use microcontrollers  
**[0:30:56-0:31:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:30:56):**  and weld your own things up it's it's not too expensive but yeah I guess we had we had  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:31:04):**  a pretty strong I guess we're relatively confident that it's an issue that needs some answers  
**[0:31:10-0:31:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:31:10):**  to and if we could I guess just build something small to give us some data to then know whether  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:31:19):**  so we built a system that was five stalls which is about we basically put about five  
**[0:31:24-0:31:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:31:24):**  sheep per stall so pretty small capacity but straight away we were seeing the variation  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:31:31):**  within and thought geez there's something something in this wire some of these so far  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:31:37):**  one way in a performance point of view and or a cost of gain point of view and some so  
**[0:31:42-0:31:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:31:42):**  far the other way so that sort of gave us a little bit to expand upon and then we also  
**[0:31:48-0:31:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:31:48):**  applied for some funding which we which we got with MLAs producer innovation fast rate  
**[0:31:55-0:32:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:31:55):**  program so that's helped probably continue on with with a bigger scale I guess yeah and  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:32:05):**  so what do you what if anything would you do differently kind of knowing what you know  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:32:09):**  now and whether that's around like how you'd work with a software engineer or what you  
**[0:32:14-0:32:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:32:14):**  would test first like what would you if anything do differently yeah I think I think what we're  
**[0:32:21-0:32:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:32:21):**  saying before is you would really just test the market in terms of asking questions to  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:32:28):**  lots of people and people you don't know and really find out whether the issues that you  
**[0:32:33-0:32:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:32:33):**  think an issue are actually issues for other people because which I have found out that  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:32:41):**  it's quite varying and something that you think is the biggest pain in the neck other  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:32:46):**  people couldn't care less about it so you can say you could save a whole lot of time  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:32:52):**  by just going and asking questions more than building something then going here what do  
**[0:32:56-0:33:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:32:56):**  you reckon and they look at it and think no I don't need that so yeah definitely can yeah  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:33:05):**  just going out to people and and just chatting with them I mean I think we probably talk  
**[0:33:11-0:33:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:33:11):**  to like-minded people so you all discuss the same sort of issues but it's within a closed  
**[0:33:19-0:33:23](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:33:19):**  you know a small group I suppose so you don't really understand how big an issue that is  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:33:23):**  and then in different locations like geographic locations I suppose as well yeah yeah interesting  
**[0:33:29-0:33:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:33:29):**  and so um you've also like this is potentially kind of a new business right this is crown  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:33:35):**  as opposed to the farm and you mentioned Hamish your business partner and another kind of  
**[0:33:40-0:33:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:33:40):**  engineer that's working with you is like what's the team dynamic like in that it's not a you  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:33:46):**  know a farming business it's kind of uncertain and things are changing and you know different  
**[0:33:50-0:33:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:33:50):**  kinds of funding like what has it been like to kind of work in that space and have a team  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:33:56):**  kind of moving in the same or different directions managing a software engineer how have you  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:34:01):**  found that yeah it's been interesting and and completely different than what a family  
**[0:34:07-0:34:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:34:07):**  farm operates like and I'm pretty autonomous I suppose it's just me and my father and we  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:34:15):**  just both know what needs to be done and yeah there's so that's been a pretty big learning  
**[0:34:21-0:34:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:34:21):**  curve probably communications been a big thing too but it all it's been Hamish and I've been  
**[0:34:25-0:34:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:34:25):**  friends for a long time as well and we both got probably different skill sets he's his  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:34:32):**  expertise sort of lies in the animal nutrition side and the data side of things so it really  
**[0:34:38-0:34:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:34:38):**  helped sort of I'd come up with weird ideas and he'd say either say no that's been done  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:34:45):**  or or no that's not the issue this is the issue sort of thing so it was really helpful  
**[0:34:51-0:34:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:34:51):**  to go what about this what about this and then have somebody to sound off who actually  
**[0:34:56-0:35:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:34:56):**  you know knew a lot more about animal nutrition and probably the sheep industry in general  
**[0:35:03-0:35:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:35:03):**  than I did anyway so he's very strict on the data side of things and so and I'm probably  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:35:10):**  you know I like building things and so we've both built them together in the end I suppose  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:35:16):**  but I sort of I had the sheep and the space and to muck around with it in the early days  
**[0:35:21-0:35:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:35:21):**  so it's probably worked quite well that we're different skill sets but it probably matches  
**[0:35:28-0:35:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:35:28):**  up quite well.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:35:29):**  Yeah so when you think forward here I don't know 10 years or whatever well are you still  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:35:35):**  are you is this business exist and you're working on it have you started a different  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:35:39):**  tech business are you done with with tech you know businesses entirely like what do  
**[0:35:45-0:35:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:35:45):**  you see for for the future in this space?  
**[0:35:47-0:35:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:35:47):**  No I think it's been it's been really interesting because it's something that I knew nothing  
**[0:35:53-0:36:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:35:53):**  about and so being involved with sort of this and the MLA stuff has been so I think that  
**[0:36:04-0:36:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:36:04):**  it's I've learned a lot about hardware versus software and where the value lies and what  
**[0:36:12-0:36:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:36:12):**  is scalable and what's not scalable and so yes I'm definitely just as interested in the  
**[0:36:18-0:36:25](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:36:18):**  tech side of things as I was before I'm probably a bit more skeptical now and take my time  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:36:25):**  to evaluate whether I need things or not instead of just buying them and finding out that that  
**[0:36:30-0:36:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:36:30):**  wasn't what I wanted and also I think I think at the end of the day what we have at the  
**[0:36:38-0:36:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:36:38):**  moment is is really useful for this point in time but with the technologies that are  
**[0:36:45-0:36:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:36:45):**  evolving it will probably be superseded by something else so it's a matter of being involved  
**[0:36:51-0:37:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:36:51):**  with that using that to maybe ground truth the next thing that does it faster cheaper  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:37:00):**  and make it more available to producers because of this at the scale that we're at and the  
**[0:37:05-0:37:13](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:37:05):**  cost that we're at it's it's good to build some data but I'd like it to be just as widely  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:37:13):**  used as any other trait and so we probably need to come to a to another solution that  
**[0:37:19-0:37:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:37:19):**  can find those answers for us a lot cheaper and easier I guess just thinking about tech  
**[0:37:26-0:37:32](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:37:26):**  adoption and how that relates to farmers I suppose there's you know I guess there's an  
**[0:37:32-0:37:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:37:32):**  aging population of farmers or there's a lot of older guys that are farming that and so  
**[0:37:38-0:37:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:37:38):**  if I use my father as an example he's very interested in the tech side and watching what  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:37:44):**  we can do here and what we measure and how we can compare things but it's just that it  
**[0:37:49-0:37:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:37:49):**  moves so fast that it's hard hard for them to keep up when you know maybe getting some  
**[0:37:56-0:38:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:37:56):**  guys to use a smartphone is enough sort of thing so it's just that even for myself and  
**[0:38:04-0:38:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:38:04):**  probably the Twitter thing's a good example being every generation that is below you are  
**[0:38:11-0:38:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:38:11):**  so much more computer savvy and tech savvy than the one probably that goes before them  
**[0:38:17-0:38:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:38:17):**  so it's just I think it's probably making it user friendly as possible or you're lucky  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:38:26):**  I guess if a farmer has a younger son who can embrace it understands it a lot easier  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:38:31):**  and can take it on because I don't think it's that potentially that they don't want it or  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:38:37):**  don't like it it's just how can they place it and be confident in using it I suppose.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:38:42):**  Yeah I think that confidence point is such an important one because what I've seen or  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:38:47):**  found is is people getting like they can't even start or they don't want to start and  
**[0:38:52-0:38:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:38:52):**  so you really don't even have a way to have that conversation where it's like this could  
**[0:38:56-0:39:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:38:56):**  do this or it could do this or how do we work on it it's like nah I'm not tech savvy like  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:00):**  I don't even want to try and I think that down to kind of confidence to have a go and  
**[0:39:05-0:39:09](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:05):**  you that you have enough base knowledge in how the smartphone works or how the software  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:09):**  works or whatever that you are willing to tinker around.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:17](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:14):**  Yeah yeah and I think once they start you know if it starts with a smartphone and I  
**[0:39:17-0:39:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:17):**  guess phone service is probably an issue in a lot of areas too but provided you've got  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:24):**  reasonable phone service then I think once they get a handle on the smartphone then you  
**[0:39:29-0:39:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:29):**  just you can step things up a little bit and continue on so I don't think that they're  
**[0:39:34-0:39:42](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:34):**  not capable it's just finding some where for them to start and and be able to then you  
**[0:39:42-0:39:45](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:42):**  know take the steps to go okay I can do that now I'll do this and now I can use that to  
**[0:39:45-0:39:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:45):**  do that so it's just building from the beginning and being able to understand how it all works  
**[0:39:52-0:39:55](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:52):**  getting the confidence to use it and then moving to the next thing.  
**[0:39:55-0:39:59](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:55):**  Do you think that people would be interested in like some of these older farmers would  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:39:59):**  be interested in like a tech class like is there enough desire to learn about this stuff  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:40:04):**  that they would actually kind of come learn about it or because because I'm thinking about  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:40:08):**  it from the startup perspective where if you have to build this software and then you're  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:40:12):**  trying to get users on board and you want to get feedback and it's like well first they  
**[0:40:16-0:40:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:40:16):**  have to learn how to use the smartphone and then they got to get the internet and like  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:40:19):**  it's like oh my god I just go do something else like it's just too hard I'm wondering  
**[0:40:24-0:40:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:40:24):**  is there like anything to kind of help I guess make this go faster or is it that the products  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:40:30):**  just aren't good enough yet that no one's gonna go spend time learning how to do it  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:40:34):**  until it's like I need to I need to get this app because it's so good.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:40:38):**  Yeah I think it's probably a matter of one finding the really big issues like the main  
**[0:40:44-0:40:51](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:40:44):**  big issues that people and maybe if it's just data to add data recording that you know quite  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:40:51):**  simple to do once you get a handle on it and that's you know comes with a smartphone so  
**[0:40:57-0:41:03](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:40:57):**  you if it's as simple as that I'm sure that you can then take it on and it's the things  
**[0:41:03-0:41:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:41:03):**  that we use all the time too so from a sheep point of view here we use like an auto drafter  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:41:10):**  which collects a lot of information so we've got an app that our sheep yards are connected  
**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:41:16):**  by Wi-Fi so as soon as we finished say weighing a mob of sheep that automatically gets emailed  
**[0:41:22-0:41:29](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:41:22):**  back to the office so that I can then go and analyze that data so they're not overly complex  
**[0:41:29-0:41:36](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:41:29):**  things to do and I'm sure that they'd find them quite easily tied in with what like they  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:41:36):**  do as long as it's you know somebody just took the time to show them how they did it  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:41:41):**  and because they're such repetitive tasks so once you do it a few times then you're  
**[0:41:46-0:41:49](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:41:46):**  doing the same thing every time it becomes a lot easier.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:41:49):**  I think that's a really good reason why it's so important for people wanting to build technology  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:41:53):**  to come see the farm because once you've spent time and you're seeing like oh they're like  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:41:58):**  downloading this USB stick and then analyzing this data in the exact same way it's like  
**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:42:02):**  well we should just write some software to do that because that's easy but until you  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:42:06):**  see how painful it is you wouldn't know that that's even happening.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:18](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:42:10):**  Yep yeah for sure yeah if you can just make that data transition a lot more seamless then  
**[0:42:18-0:42:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:42:18):**  it makes it yeah not so clunky that I've got to plug the USB into this one then I've got  
**[0:42:22-0:42:26](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:42:22):**  to walk back to the house and then I've got to plug it into the computer there and then  
**[0:42:26-0:42:33](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:42:26):**  that doesn't work so yeah if that data collection side of things is a lot more seamless yeah  
**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:42:33):**  it would make it I think it would make the uptake maybe a lot more and the same from  
**[0:42:38-0:42:44](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:42:38):**  the cropping side we had you know we were collecting yield data all the time but it's  
**[0:42:44-0:42:50](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:42:44):**  what do you do with that information later on so I'm sure a lot of guys collect a lot  
**[0:42:50-0:42:54](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:42:50):**  of older guys drive headers and collect a lot of yield data and it's just sitting on  
**[0:42:54-0:43:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:42:54):**  the storage of the header going I'm not sure where to use that sort of thing so.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:06](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:43:01):**  Yep I think that's a like a joke that gets told like there's a lot of uptake of technology  
**[0:43:06-0:43:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:43:06):**  but not a lot of kind of value coming from it especially in cases like that where yeah  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:43:11):**  it's on the header but they're not actually you know using it to make decisions or using  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:43:15):**  it using it to drive productivity and so is that really adoption or is that just kind  
**[0:43:19-0:43:22](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:43:19):**  of default presence like.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:31](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:43:22):**  Yeah yeah and yeah like you say probably the best thing to do is get the tech guys to come  
**[0:43:31-0:43:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:43:31):**  and just visit a whole different type of farms and see what they do and they're the people  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:43:37):**  that probably pick up because we do it day to day so we don't really take much notice  
**[0:43:43-0:43:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:43:43):**  of what what is annoying and what's not up you know you probably just that's the job  
**[0:43:48-0:43:52](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:43:48):**  there's no other way to do it so we just do it that way and then they go they might look  
**[0:43:52-0:43:56](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:43:52):**  at it and go why would you do it like that you can when you can do it like this and you  
**[0:43:56-0:44:01](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:43:56):**  go and so you know the best thing yeah it's probably for them to see it and then they  
**[0:44:01-0:44:05](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:44:01):**  can make that process a lot easier.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:11](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:44:05):**  Yep well that sounds like a really good kind of call to action here for anyone listening  
**[0:44:11-0:44:14](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:44:11):**  to the podcast that if they have some ideas for work in this space it sounds like you're  
**[0:44:14-0:44:21](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:44:14):**  pretty open to collaboration or you know finding ways to get more data and experiment in different  
**[0:44:21-0:44:24](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:44:21):**  ways with the tech you've already built and the setup you guys already have so where can  
**[0:44:24-0:44:28](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:44:24):**  people find you how can they get in touch with you or how can they learn more about  
**[0:44:28-0:44:30](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:44:28):**  what you're doing.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:37](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:44:30):**  Yeah so we're called Crown Agriculture and probably email is the best way to get in touch  
**[0:44:37-0:44:48](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:44:37):**  or even just by phone so yeah it's just williamatcrownagriculture.com.au or you can get in touch with Hamish  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:44:48):**  who's hamishatcrownagriculture.com.au so that's probably the easiest way.  
**[0:44:53-0:45:00](https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357331#t=0:44:53):**  Yeah well we know they can't find you on Twitter because we don't respond to them.

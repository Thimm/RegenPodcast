### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 27 Jul 2022 20:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:06):**  I'm Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:07):**  I think it's safe to say that agrobotics is finally, or at least very nearly, here.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:13):**  From autonomous equipment, to retrofit kits, to hyper-specialized tools and attachments,  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:18):**  startups are taking all kinds of approaches to bring solutions to market.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:22):**  And as they do, fundamentally new practices are becoming viable.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:26):**  But with the arrival of all this cutting-edge technology, how should we think about the  
**[0:00:30-0:00:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:30):**  different categories of solutions?  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:33):**  And will one company, whether a startup or an OEM, end up building all of the hardware  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:38):**  and the software needed to make those implements useful?  
**[0:00:41-0:00:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:41):**  A robot on its own does nothing.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:43):**  So we partner with other companies to put their technology on board.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:47):**  There's no way that we can develop all these different things we need, because it's not  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:50):**  one, it's not a dozen, it's not 20, it's not 100.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:53):**  We need thousands of different developers creating smart ag tech to go and build our  
**[0:00:57-0:00:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:57):**  robots.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:00:58):**  That's Andrew Bait, co-founder of Swarm Farm Robotics, based in Queensland, Australia.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:01:03):**  Andrew and his co-founder and wife, Jossie, have been building this autonomous equipment  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:01:07):**  company on their farm in Emerald and watching closely at how the autonomous ag space is  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:01:12):**  evolving, what farmers want and how the future will look, not just in Australia, but also  
**[0:01:17-0:01:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:01:17):**  around the world.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:01:18):**  But first, a relevant disclosure.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:01:20):**  Tenacious Ventures is an investor in Swarm Farm, and both Andrew and I sit on the board,  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:01:24):**  which means, among other things, that I won't go easy on Andrew today.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:01:28):**  This podcast is also, of course, not investment advice.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:01:32):**  Andrew's background is in agronomy, and he started his career checking cotton and grain  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:01:35):**  crops for pests in northern Australia.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:01:38):**  It wasn't until he was back on the family farm that he felt maybe engineering would  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:01:42):**  have been the better route, given his love of building things, solving problems and finding  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:01:46):**  new ways to farm, which led him down the path to robotics.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:01:50):**  But the path from farmer and tinkerer to founder wasn't necessarily an obvious one, and it  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:01:54):**  took experiences in advocacy, farm entrepreneurship and, believe it or not, water skiing to help  
**[0:02:00-0:02:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:00):**  him and Jossie found Swarm Farm.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:02):**  It also took a good amount of frustration.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:05):**  Here's Andrew.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:06):**  I think I got frustrated with precision ag and big data.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:09):**  I did some precision ag courses early through agronomy, and I was one of the first guys  
**[0:02:14-0:02:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:14):**  at the head of yield monitors and one of the first guys, when they turned selective availability  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:17):**  off of GPS to get a high accuracy GPS at the time, which was accurate to 10 metres.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:22):**  But I think what was really burning me was our farming practices weren't changing.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:28):**  And there was two things about robotics.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:31):**  One agriculture has been built on massive machinery and getting more efficient by getting  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:35):**  larger machines in your paddock.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:38):**  And we found that the larger we went, the more we compromised and we were going backwards  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:43):**  in our own farming operations.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:44):**  It's machine.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:45):**  It was too big and too cumbersome.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:46):**  And if we could go robotic, we could make machines that actually grew higher yields  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:50):**  and would be better.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:52):**  And the other thing was to bring these new farming practices into agriculture that we  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:55):**  didn't see now.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:02:56):**  So we kind of buy farming machinery and we designed our farm to work around that farming  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:01):**  machinery and those field practices that were the limitation on how we farmed.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:06):**  And so with robotics, there was an entire world of new technology that could be released  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:09):**  on board robots that could fundamentally change the way we produce our crops in the field.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:13):**  And that's been an ethos and the beginnings of Swarm Farm was to bring new field practices  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:18):**  into agriculture to fundamentally change the way we grow crops in the field and robotics  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:22):**  was the key to doing that.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:23):**  So that's how we, how I guess we fell into building robotic company.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:28):**  We wanted to bring new farming practices into agriculture.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:31):**  And did you look around, were there other robotics companies, other research projects  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:34):**  or things overseas or things in the pipeline that you said, oh, maybe they'll do it and  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:39):**  we should just wait for it?  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:40):**  Or yeah, what did you see in the landscape?  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:43):**  It was really early days in robotics.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:45):**  We started Google, didn't have a driver's car program and Uber didn't exist.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:48):**  You couldn't pick up a drone on your way home from Harvey Norman.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:51):**  I guess I thought we would get our first technology from the military.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:54):**  So I spent a lot of time talking to military companies, seeing whether we could get some  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:03:58):**  of that technology and bring it into agriculture.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:01):**  And we realized that the technology and military really wasn't going to work in agriculture.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:04):**  It was too expensive.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:05):**  It wasn't designed for agriculture.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:07):**  There are all sorts of reasons why it wasn't the right fit.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:10):**  What's an example?  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:11):**  Wasn't it designed for ag?  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:13):**  I think certainly the cost of the entry point of technology was just out of the realms of  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:17):**  agriculture and there was so much more that needed to be done to be used in agriculture.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:21):**  On the frontline, the cost is no object compared to what they're trying to achieve in their  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:25):**  missions.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:26):**  But what we did find was Australia was really strong in mining robotics and we had the mine  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:29):**  of the future running from the Pilbara.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:31):**  And we had some really experienced universities and people in Australia that had pioneered  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:35):**  that industry.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:37):**  And so we're able to form partnerships and springboard off that.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:39):**  So that's how we got our start.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:41):**  And did you find that was better suited?  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:42):**  Did that approach work out in terms of the mining tech being a good fit?  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:47):**  I think it was probably more the people that we're able to get and the experience we could  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:50):**  bring in.

**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:54):**  Obviously, the cost has to be much lower, but the environment's far more open too.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:04:58):**  So a closed mine site is a world away from a farming paddock.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:02):**  And we formed partnerships with two universities and kicked off our first projects and that's  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:06):**  how we got started.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:07):**  And that was probably really valuable time for us because stepping from working on a  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:12):**  farm and being a farmer to developing a tech company, I'm not a software engineer, I don't  
**[0:05:16-0:05:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:16):**  write code.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:17):**  But what I did learn through that working with universities was how to build software  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:20):**  development teams, how to build our tech stack.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:23):**  We developed our technology roadmap and were able to start building a tech company.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:27):**  And those skills were really valuable and we learned a lot of lessons through the university  
**[0:05:30-0:05:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:30):**  sector.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:31):**  And we got to the stage where we realised that work in an academic environment without  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:35):**  growing that.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:36):**  And so probably about year two, we broke out of the universities and started to develop  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:40):**  our own technology and employ our own software development team and we grew from there.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:45):**  And why didn't it work out to keep collaborating with the university?  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:48):**  Was it a cultural mismatch or pacing, you said?  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:51):**  What did you think would work there that didn't?  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:53):**  Yeah, I think cultural.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:55):**  So I think it's changing now in Australia.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:05:58):**  We're starting to see it, but in this country, we talk a lot about R, D and C and everyone  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:02):**  talks about R and D. And R and D shouldn't be put together.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:06):**  They need to remove the and, it shouldn't be there.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:09):**  And people say, we're going to do R and D. Well, research is a world away from development.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:13):**  Nothing in fact to do with development.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:16):**  Research is discoveries new to science and universities are great at doing that.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:20):**  What we actually need if we're going to commercialise technology and get it into the hands of farmers  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:25):**  is development of technology that can be commercialised.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:28):**  And notice there's no R in that.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:30):**  And we so often, we used to see government programmes or even industry programmes, it's  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:33):**  called R and D and are all based in universities and nothing would ever turn up for a farmer  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:38):**  in the five year, 10 year timeframe.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:40):**  Some stuff did, but we've got research papers stacked and sealing and very little actually  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:45):**  delivering an R and Y to farmers.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:47):**  I think what's changed and is we're starting to see more and more conversations now about  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:52):**  supporting the D part, the development of technology so it can be commercialised now.  
**[0:06:57-0:06:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:57):**  And that's what startups do.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:06:58):**  They develop a product, find a product market fit, find the business model, support it.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:03):**  So it can actually be commercialised and delivered en masse to an industry.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:06):**  Do you have any examples of what, for you guys, a mismatch with the university?  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:09):**  Like any stories that come to mind of it was too slow or too expensive or anything like  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:13):**  that that you can share?  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:15):**  I do remember early in some of our projects being sat down and told we're here to make  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:19):**  discoveries in a new design so it can be publicised.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:22):**  It's publish or die.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:23):**  If we can't publish, we die.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:25):**  So that's our focus and being very disheartened by those conversations because we're here  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:30):**  to revolutionise an industry and create a new industry and we're funding these projects.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:35):**  We're putting our own money in that we've saved up into these projects.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:38):**  And this is why technology doesn't get in the hands of farmers in terms of really making  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:43):**  a difference because a publication is no use to a farmer until it's been developed through  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:48):**  to something they can use.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:49):**  So yeah, there was a cultural shock for us and we're able to navigate through that, have  
**[0:07:53-0:07:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:53):**  discussions and work out how we could get through that.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:55):**  But I think once again, going into a technology company and being a bit naive probably helps  
**[0:07:59-0:08:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:07:59):**  because if we'd known that we probably wouldn't have done it, but we wouldn't have learned  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:08:02):**  the skills on how to build a software development team and pull together a tech portfolio that

**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:08:08):**  And speaking of your team, you guys are still located in Emerald and in some cases still  
**[0:08:13-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:08:13):**  on the farm.

**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:08:18):**  a regional area and that kind of even on farm aspect?  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:08:22):**  There's lots of people that told us you couldn't build a tech company in rural Australia.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:08:25):**  And despite some probably some good advice that how hard it was going to be, it was a  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:08:30):**  value of ours we decided to keep and we weren't going to let go.

**[0:08:38-0:08:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:08:38):**  kind of like a hurdle.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:08:39):**  When someone applied for a job, if they couldn't make that hurdle, they weren't good enough

**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:08:47):**  And it's probably one of the things that's led us to success that we're boots on the  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:08:51):**  ground and we turn software engineers into farmers.

**[0:09:23-0:09:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:09:23):**  Our home base is a little town called Gindy near Emerald.

**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:11:34):**  If I think back to when iPhones came out, I had a Nokia phone and when I bought my first  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:11:40):**  iPhone, I took it home, didn't do much, it just made phone calls like my Nokia used to.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:11:45):**  It became revolutionary when there were dozens and then hundreds and then thousands of developers

**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:12:31):**  What's an example of an app that's been released today and what's one that you're excited about  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:12:36):**  in the future?  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:12:37):**  So a lot of our robots go out with weed detection cameras on board the robots.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:12:40):**  So they detect individual weeds and just spot spray them with a herbicide when they see  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:12:46):**  a weed.

**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:13:12):**  And it's a really good ROI and delivering big results for farmers in terms of saving  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:13:17):**  the amount of pesticide they use each year.

**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:13:33):**  No one's there yet picking fruit robotically yet.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:13:37):**  It's coming and I think we're down to the stage now where it's 18 months, two years  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:13:40):**  away from seeing ROI type commercial release.

**[0:13:48-0:13:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:13:48):**  like lasers or steam, it can kill weeds.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:13:50):**  That's really smart technology that's coming like a freight train now.

**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:13:58):**  Obviously at the moment you nearly need to sell your left kidney to get hold of nitrogen  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:14:02):**  fertilizer now.

**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:14:23):**  It's just going to be smartly applied and going to make a real difference.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:14:26):**  Can you talk about the platform, it starts to get to what you guys call an ecosystem.

**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:14:34):**  Like how do you end up kind of winning in this platform ecosystem strategy?  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:14:38):**  Are you currently winning?  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:14:40):**  What does winning look like?  
**[0:14:41-0:14:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:14:41):**  And probably get a lot of pushback around.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:14:43):**  Don't you need distribution?  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:14:44):**  Aren't you going to work with the big guys?  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:14:46):**  So yes, sell me on why this is the right model.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:14:49):**  I think if you look at how this ag robotic market's kind of evolving, it's an interesting  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:14:54):**  time.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:14:55):**  We see three categories that are forming now.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:14:58):**  So the first category is drivers tractors or aftermarket autonomy kits.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:15:03):**  You've got John D announcing it's autonomy program with large marketing budget, lots  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:15:07):**  of fanfare.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:15:08):**  You've got case buying up Raven, you bought DOT.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:15:11):**  You've got companies like Monarch with electric drive tractors out there that are autonomous.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:15:16):**  And then you've got other companies like retrofit kits out there as well.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:15:19):**  So you Spardos, Blue White, GoTrax, those sort of companies.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:15:22):**  I think if you think of this category, it's to be compared to automotive.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:15:26):**  It's a bit like Ford or BMW in the automotive space.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:15:29):**  So these guys are incumbents and they've got a large share of the market and they're going  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:15:33):**  to fight to keep that market as innovation's happening.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:15:36):**  But if our Ford and BMW actually adding to their market by adding autonomy or electric  
**[0:15:42-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:15:42):**  drive to the car range, or is this a fight to keep their market?  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:15:45):**  And I think that's the kind of play we're seeing right now in that category.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:15:49):**  And I think that this category really relies on dealership networks and a loyalty of legacy  
**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:15:55):**  to retain their market share and an increasingly digital changing marketplace.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:16:01):**  And the aftermarket kits are kind of more likely to be acquired as they become standard  
**[0:16:05-0:16:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:16:05):**  features on board tractors.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:16:07):**  So I see a short runway there in terms of success in terms of aftermarket kits.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:16:12):**  But what's more interesting is the second category that's formed, which is especially  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:16:16):**  robots in your kind of what we call high value verticals and agrobotics.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:16:20):**  These are companies that have identified a $1 billion identified market and they're tightly  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:16:24):**  focused and aimed and they're hyper-focused applications that just do one thing, but do  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:16:29):**  it really well.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:16:30):**  So if you think about something like robotically picking an apple, there's a market opportunity  
**[0:16:35-0:16:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:16:35):**  out there.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:16:36):**  It's a $40 to $60 billion market opportunity out there directly if you pick an apple.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:16:40):**  And so we're seeing a lot of interest in here in terms of really high end robotic solutions  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:16:45):**  and solve problems in agriculture.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:16:47):**  And the key thing is that companies in this category, this high value verticals, they  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:16:52):**  create value and they create new markets that that first category can't get with incremental  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:16:57):**  features and traditional business models.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:17:00):**  So companies you see in here are like Abundant Robotics that was developing apples that are  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:17:04):**  free launched now, Carbon Robotics, FarmWise, and they're really highly targeted, highly  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:17:10):**  focused companies that are often solar powered, AI, machine learning, computer vision type  
**[0:17:15-0:17:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:17:15):**  things that say cool weeds in lettuces with lasers designed for the Salinas Valley, often  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:17:22):**  Silicon Valley kind of funded companies.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:17:24):**  And if you bring that back to the automotive world, I think it is category creating the  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:17:29):**  value like mobile or Intel has done in the autonomous car market.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:17:33):**  The last category is what we call platform autonomy and that's where we sit.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:17:37):**  And these are the autonomous tool carriers that carry smart implements and new technology  
**[0:17:41-0:17:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:17:41):**  into agriculture's attachments.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:17:43):**  And this is where autonomy really sits in terms of the one trick parties in category  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:17:48):**  two that create huge vertical value, can't deliver broad solutions across agriculture.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:17:53):**  If we're truly looking to bring new farming practices revolutionize agriculture, it's  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:17:58):**  not going to be done through a high value vertical.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:18:01):**  So platform autonomy unlocks value across verticals in CAT2 by being the conduit to  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:18:06):**  market across all crops and markets.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:18:09):**  So the sort of company sitting in here is like Nairobotic, Agro and Telio, the DotRobot,  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:18:14):**  ourselves sit in this category.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:18:16):**  And this is where new value is being captured with new business models and a growing customer  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:18:21):**  base across multiple industries.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:18:24):**  And if you want to jump back to automotive, and I like this analogy, but if Ford and BMW  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:18:28):**  are in kind of category one, this is where Tesla and Rivian sit in the autonomous car  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:18:32):**  market.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:18:33):**  And if you look at the fanfare and the loyalty of say Tesla with a growing customer base  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:18:38):**  and how that redefined just how a car could be built, what it could do, how it could be  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:18:43):**  sold, this bucket doesn't just capture the value of ag machinery, it captures value across  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:18:48):**  the vertical technology in the sector, and will also capture value in terms of production  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:18:53):**  and even agronomy in agriculture.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:18:55):**  And this is where I see agrobotics at an adventure scale across multiple industries.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:18:59):**  It's interesting time and I think you're seeing a lot of deal flow and seeing a lot of excitement  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:03):**  and fizzing kind of category one and category two right now.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:06):**  And category three is probably the underserved category, I think, in terms of opportunities  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:10):**  right now and in terms of robotics.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:13):**  Why do you think that category one and category two have attracted more funding and more press  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:18):**  and that kind of thing?  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:19):**  Well, I mean, sharks with lasers, right?  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:22):**  Everyone's seen the Austin Powers movie and the shiny thing is a high value vertical that  
**[0:19:26-0:19:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:26):**  revolutionizes.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:27):**  I mean, think about it being able to kill weeds with no chemicals is really high value  
**[0:19:31-0:19:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:31):**  add.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:32):**  And being able to pick an apple, whether it's an orange or whether it's pruning, but grapevine  
**[0:19:36-0:19:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:36):**  with a robot is really high value add and inspires people.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:38):**  And it's a great story.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:39):**  And it's a really tight ROI and the kind of target market that can be defined, funded  
**[0:19:45-0:19:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:45):**  and fits the VC model.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:47):**  So I think that's why you see so much interest in CAT2.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:50):**  I think CAT1 is, I think it's incremental and it doesn't take a lot of imagination to

**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:19:58):**  I think everyone's been talking about driverless tractors forever.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:00):**  I think the world's been amazed by driverless cars and what the technology could be there.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:04):**  It's an interesting category as well.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:06):**  And there's incumbent spending money in that sector, probably less terms of VC or external  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:10):**  investment, but there's internal investment from incumbents in there, which is probably  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:14):**  a little bit of a signal as to the potential in that market.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:18):**  And so I think platform autonomy, I think you need to understand more about ag and it  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:22):**  takes deeper insight to imagine what the future looks like in that.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:25):**  Why is that?  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:26):**  What is it that you can do in the platform category or if you're a farmer, why do you  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:29):**  end up preferring that kind of solution?  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:31):**  I imagine some of the challenges like who distributes it, who services it, do I have  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:35):**  to farm differently, change practices?  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:37):**  There's a bit of a shift there.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:38):**  What's better about it?  
**[0:20:40-0:20:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:40):**  Because it really opens up innovation.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:42):**  So in terms of platform autonomy, it's antagonistic in terms of what goes on board and who develops  
**[0:20:47-0:20:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:47):**  the technology to solve a problem.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:49):**  Because if it's genuinely a platform technology, it embraces everyone to create the solutions  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:54):**  and deliver it on boards.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:20:55):**  When you think of three ag tech developers, five ag tech developers, 50 different companies  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:00):**  developing technology, you get competitive tension between developers that develop better  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:05):**  solutions and deliver them through the farmers.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:07):**  So that adds value to you as a farmer.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:09):**  There's three companies with weed detection technology on board our robots now and they're  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:13):**  adding more value as they incrementally improve their technology to the farmers that use it.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:18):**  So I think that's really important.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:20):**  And I think the ability also to invite other companies in.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:23):**  A lot of the new attachments going on our robots, companies are invited in by the farmers,  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:28):**  the user base will be using our robots as well.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:31):**  But I think the other thing is the different business models out there.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:34):**  If you look at how ags evolved and ags been traditional in so many ways, we see path to  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:39):**  market through traditional dealership models that are kind of bricks and mortar.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:43):**  And you go in and buy your tractor from a dealer, shake hands with the salesman.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:48):**  Are those value propositions really adding value in the modern world?  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:52):**  I find as a farmer and a lot of farmers we talk to, by the time you go to buy a tractor,  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:57):**  you already know what you're going to buy.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:21:59):**  You're only there to haggle with the sales guy.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:22:01):**  And that's annoying to have to do that because you've already been on Twitter and asked your

**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:22:18):**  farm about global expansion and doing that with our dealers and with direct sales and

**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:22:47):**  How do farmers in this world get your robot?

**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:27:05):**  We've got one farmer now who has three of our robots.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:27:08):**  He's actually intercropping now with cover crops between his cotton crops.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:27:13):**  So he used to grow our rotation where he grew half his farm to cover crop, half to crop.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:27:18):**  He's now planted the entire farm to strips of cover crop and commercial crop as well.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:27:23):**  And so he's really targeting a better water use efficiency because in a really wet year,  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:27:27):**  he's able to capitalize on excess rainfall, but he's still able to hold his yields in

**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:29:16):**  I'm not saying there isn't, but what's the secondhand market for this is this becomes  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:29:20):**  five-year-old and becomes unreliable because no one wants an autonomous machine that's  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:29:25):**  not reliable.

**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:29:28):**  It just gets out and works.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:29:29):**  So you just push the button and away it goes.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:29:31):**  So I think there's some interesting conversations are going on.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:29:33):**  We're hearing that in the field as well.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:29:35):**  You mentioned a few environmental drivers for you guys and some of the reducing chemicals  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:29:39):**  and cover cropping and things like that.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:29:41):**  But you mentioned using a diesel engine.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:29:44):**  What's your view on why diesel, why not electrification is that coming?  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:29:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:29:49):**  In terms of power plants, our first robots actually were electric drive.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:29:52):**  We then stepped into diesel power because we realized that we weren't going to get there  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:29:56):**  on electric drive in the short term.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:29:58):**  And often say it's like Elon started with his driver's cars and Tesla's proven to the  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:02):**  world that there was a market for electric cars and they could be awesome.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:07):**  And he started over here and now that he's proven that the world wants electric cars  
**[0:30:11-0:30:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:11):**  and there's a market for it, he's now developing autonomy.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:14):**  It's going to meet in the middle somewhere.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:16):**  We started the other way around.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:17):**  Farmers didn't have a desire for electric drive tractor, but they had a huge desire  
**[0:30:21-0:30:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:21):**  for autonomy.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:22):**  So we went out and proved to the world that farmers and the world's ready for autonomous  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:25):**  technology and agriculture.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:27):**  And we've proven that now and we have this product market fit and massive demand for  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:31):**  what we're doing.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:33):**  And so now our opportunity is now we've got that the value add here is electric drive  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:36):**  to go on top.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:37):**  So we've started in the opposite end to Elon and in the middle, we're going to meet with  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:40):**  electric drives in the future.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:42):**  But I think the kicker for this is renewable energy and obviously the cost of diesel and  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:47):**  all these things right now, the desire to have alternative fuels is getting more exciting.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:52):**  And I'm super excited about, I think, hydrogen and the potential to produce it at source.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:30:57):**  And I think there's some really good kind of fits there in agriculture because of the  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:03):**  logistics and the ability to produce hydrogen at source and store it and the energy density  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:07):**  we've achieved.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:08):**  So pretty excited about the opportunities for that and the opportunities for hydrogen  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:11):**  to value add even for nitrogen use on farm in terms of fertilizer as well.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:15):**  Something keeps me awake at night thinking about the opportunities on that one.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:17):**  Not quite ready to do it yet, but certainly in the future there'll be opportunities.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:21):**  And how about the kind of classic existential question of whether we're replacing jobs and  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:25):**  human labor with autonomy and what does that mean for these regional communities?  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:29):**  What's your response to that?  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:32):**  It's interesting that the first five robots we sold were at the Australian Cotton Conference  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:36):**  three years ago.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:38):**  And every one of those growers said, I want this technology on my farm because we need  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:43):**  to engage the next generation in ag.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:46):**  I want this technology on my farm so I get more good engaged people in agriculture.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:50):**  And it was a really genuine kind of comment that kind of came out from all of them.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:53):**  And it was interesting since then that comment just keeps coming through that we need to  
**[0:31:57-0:32:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:31:57):**  get more young people involved in agriculture.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:32:00):**  And if this technology helps, that is a really good thing.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:32:03):**  And I still consider myself a young farmer even though I'm getting a bit older now.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:32:07):**  But the opportunity to bring more people into agriculture is something that's very important  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:32:10):**  to Josie and I, the founders of Swarm Farm.

**[0:32:16-0:32:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:32:16):**  into agriculture and to create wealth in our regional towns and communities.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:32:20):**  And if that's because more people are coming into ag to get involved in farming and the

**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:32:28):**  setting up to service and support robots and creating job opportunities in our towns and  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:32:32):**  regions, if that means more ag tech entrepreneurs are setting up developing solutions for agriculture,  
**[0:32:38-0:32:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/7/28/autonomous-farming-solutions-robotics-in-ag#t=0:32:38):**  high value vertical technology that can be released on board robots, I think that's fantastic.

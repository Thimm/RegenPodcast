### Agtech - So What?  (2021-01-08)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to Ag Tech So What, brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  I'm Sarah Nolette.  When you think of the stereotype of a quote unquote regenerative farmer, my next guest,  Lauren Steinloggy, may not exactly fit the image that comes to mind.  Lauren, who farms in Iowa, has been tinkering with ag machinery for as long as he can remember.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:00:23):**  So when he started looking more into soil health and practices such as cover cropping  and relay cropping, he started tweaking equipment to make it do the new jobs he needed it to.  Now other farmers and even machinery manufacturers are paying attention to his innovations.  It's Lauren's understanding of farming, machinery, business, and soil health at an in-depth and  practical level that's helped him to tackle some big farming and tech challenges.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:00:50):**  Like Lauren has a system that allows him to grow a crop 365 days a year, even under snow.  But Lauren became motivated to share his innovations for very personal reasons.  After his son, Roland, was diagnosed with a brain tumor at the age of 12.  Soon as Roland got sick, I realized that chances are the farm could die with me.  And I just said, I'm not a selfish person.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:01:14):**  I'm going to start sharing ideals.  And the next thing you know, when you start sharing ideals, more people share ideals with  you and it just snowballs from there.  In fact, Lauren has had to overcome multiple life-changing events and adapt as a result.  The first one happened when he was just a newborn baby.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:01:36):**  My dad moved here in 1968 and then I was born a year later.  About six weeks after I was born, he was burnt 75% over his body.  And the doctors and everybody told him he pretty well never farmed, but he quickly figured  out that his only option to keep farming was to fully automate.  And we went from bucket milking to pipeline, fully automated feeding systems and all that.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:07):**  And that trend just kept progressing all the way up and through the 80s.  And he was one of the survivors of the 80s.  He never really got overextended.  So coming out of the farm crisis in the 80s, he was in a position he could start buying  land and stuff like that.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:28):**  He always had the attitude, if it ain't fun, we're not going to do it.  Every one of us kids came home to farm.  I got a brother and three sisters.  Some of them have now moved on from farming since, but he started every one of us farming  at least twice was the joke we always had.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:44):**  You said your dad was focused on making sure it was fun.  What's an example?  Do you have any kind of early memories of farming being fun?  Oh, just, I don't know.  You never made things of hard work.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:02:58):**  If it was mundane and hard work, we just figured out a better way to do it.  And that was kind of instilled in me at an early age.  So everything I do anymore is how to become more efficient, how to get by with about as  little help as possible.  And I was pretty well focused about 10th grader.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:03:17):**  We got a 12th grade system here in the States, about 10th grader ready.  I was pretty well focused that I was going to go home and farm.  Our class had 117 kids in, and I was the only one that was going to go straight home to  farm, but I always told everybody I was going to stay all the way through graduation just  to prove a point that, you know, like bankers and that they'd see, I wasn't afraid to commit.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:03:39):**  So I always joke that I graduated high school on a social degree.  And, you know, my senior year in high school, I never went a full day.  As a teenager, Lauren started farming in partnership with his dad Florian, creating Flow Low Farms.  And while Lauren's father was his first teacher on how to be innovative in agriculture, Lauren  also had to learn to adapt out of necessity when another one of those life changing moments  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:03):**  arrived.  At the age of 14, while in a tractor, he was hit by a truck as it tried to pass him.  Now Lauren recovered from his injuries, but due to scar tissue, 10 years later, he found  he just physically could no longer work with animals.  And that's when I had to decide, you know, I couldn't be around livestock anymore.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:23):**  So I started focusing on the row crop.  I always enjoyed the row crop production and equipment more than the livestock anyways.  My forte is I love designing and building equipment, figuring out how to make stuff  work better.  That just, when the cows left, I focused hard on custom work, you know, and our peak, I  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:40):**  was probably 2,500 acres between the custom work and our own work.  Dad was still pretty heavily involved.  My wife was, it was basically the three of us putting the crop in, taking it out every  year.  And well, 09 is when Roland got sick and you know, I just, I was pretty hard corn on corn  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:04:57):**  back in them days.  You know, I just, I didn't even think about it.  I just called the grain buyer and said, Hey, can we roll my corn contracts into bean contracts?  All the seed dealer rolled all the seed in and farming became easy that year.  Our son had a 20% chance of living a year.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:12):**  That's basically what they told us.  You know, so we just focused on living in that time.  And the more removed I got from the farm, the more a guy learned how to time stuff,  get stuff done quick, and then focus on the family.  And this day, I never, I never thought I'd walk away from the farm as much as I do, but  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:33):**  I just learned, I become more efficient when you're more focused.  Do you, it's such a tough one because you would never wish that I mentioned on anyone  to have such a, you know, a scare like that with, with your son and, and such a challenge.  And yet you, you know, some good has come of it.  It sounds like in, in, you know, farming differently and thinking about how you manage time differently.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:05:55):**  It is tough in agriculture.  Like I talked to a lot of people who, and I fall prey to it myself, where it's like,  you get so caught up in the day to day that you don't think about working smarter.  It ends up being working harder.  Do you think that's something that happens a bit nag?  
**[0:06:07-0:06:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:07):**  Do you see that?  Oh, definitely.  You know, everybody wants to be the best farmer in the world, but I've never met a bad farmer.  That's kind of what drove me, you know, as I started meeting people around the world,  everybody's trying to be the best.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:19):**  And I give credit to a friend in Australia.  And you know, he was here one time on an upfield scholarship and you really get to know the  guys when you sit there and talk to them.  I said, what's, what's your competition like in Australia?  And he's like, listen, every farmer in Australia has got to be the best farmer in the world  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:36):**  because we don't have subsidies and all that to help us survive.  And that was probably one of the triggers that started making me realize we need to  be pushing, doing better.  You know, one of them instances goes back to when we were doing the stuff with deer,  every year we'd have to go in for training.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:06:56):**  There was a relatively sizable farmer that was at the meetings every year.  And me and him got to be pretty good friends and talk during the meetings.  And he made the announcement during the meeting the one day as we're talking, he's like, yeah,  we're to the point where people call us and want us to rent their farms.  That's like, okay, somebody comes and offers you your farm or their farm, what's the deciding  
**[0:07:19-0:07:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:19):**  factor?  And he just put his finger up, $1.  I was like dollar an acre, you'll farm it?  He's like, no, if it adds a dollar to the bottom line, the whole operation, he'll add  it.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:31):**  And that was just like, I can't compete with that.  You know, so that started going down more to specialty grains and stuff like that.  As I said earlier, I love focusing on equipment.  So learning how to fine tune equipment, getting the maximum quality during harvest and stuff  like that has been probably one of the biggest booms for us.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:07:53):**  If we can capture premiums and stuff like that, or one of the favorite things I used  to do is we used to sell a lot of beans direct to Korea, soybeans for edamame and stuff like  that.  We used to, or tofu beans, whatever they all were.  But now I've had to back away from that because the guy's just getting too busy.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:10):**  I'm hoping the next generation, I'm getting ready to step out of the way and let the next  generation start handling that.  So there's a few things that I want to unpack a little bit more, Lauren.  So you mentioned the, I guess, kind of decision to go more specialty.  And it sounds like there's two things there.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:25):**  One is sort of efficiency and equipment and technologies.  And one is also like actually farming different things or thinking about different markets.  Tell me more about that.  What are some examples?  Well, for me, they go hand in hand.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:08:37):**  I mean, once you start figuring out the efficiencies, you can also get the quality.  Like I said, they go hand in hand and we've got as high as a $3 bushel premium on soybeans  over Chicago.  So that would essentially be a strong $4 premium because we're in such a low basis area.  So that's when we started, well, through my son's deal, that's when we started forcibly  
**[0:09:01-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:01):**  losing acres.  And we had landlords starting to walk away from us and other guys seeing the guy kind  of down.  So they were going after our land, but the neat part is they went after our worst land.  So we did our best land base and a lot less headaches.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:18):**  But I would say the farm itself for the last five years has probably been more profitable  at 750 acres than we ever were at 2,500 with all the custom work.  I've totally dropped custom work and all that, or I guess you guys would call it contract  work, but I've totally dropped all that.  I just focus on our acres.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:40):**  So it sounds like focus, a bit of that kind of perspective and time management.  What were some of the other keys there?  Was it, you mentioned kind of changing over to beans.  What else, what are other examples of things that you did that have led to that profitability?  Well, bringing the technology to full scale.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:09:57):**  I mean, we had the auto steering and all that, and now everything's pretty much controlled  traffic.  Tram lines of that end, we're getting by with very little herbicide.  We essentially were becoming a low cost producer.  We used the cover crops and all that.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:10):**  About 06 is when we started playing with the cover crops and stuff like that.  And that started helping us eliminate tillage and all that stuff.  Once we started figuring out we didn't need the tillage to eliminate compaction and all  that stuff.  What's key in all of this is that it's Lauren's knowledge of equipment that has enabled him  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:28):**  to become a low cost producer, targeting premiums and reducing costs rather than being stuck  on the commodities treadmill.  Without the ability to modify and adapt equipment, he'd be missing the unlock code to alternative  farming practices and entering different farming markets.  Lauren has won awards for his innovations, but he's still very modest about what he's  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:10:48):**  achieved.  2012 was the first time I was ever asked to do a public presentation.  And when I was in school, they didn't have such a thing as PowerPoint and all that.  So I had to have my daughter do my first PowerPoint for me and all that.  I walked on stage to a group of 100 engineers.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:11:08):**  I walked on stage and introduced myself as the unengineer.  It's just for what we're doing.  Usually traditional equipment doesn't work.  So everything we've done, I've had the custom builder modifier back to when Roland got sick.  It was to the point we had to have appraisers out to keep him insured.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:11:29):**  We had to have appraisers out to keep insurance on our kids and that.  And the guy that did the appraisal wrote on there, there's only one way to force or one  way to appraise this line of equipment is to force an auction because none of it has  standard value.  I mean, everything that was even close to remotely standard was the tractors probably.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:11:52):**  And we did everything from the planners to the heads, you name it, were custom built.  And you did a lot of that work yourself.  Give me an example or two of one that's worked out well.  Probably the best one has been the no-till drill we built from the ground up in 2016.  That was the 10th drill we had built.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:14):**  That was when we really started getting the companion cropping and the interseeding all  figured out.  Well, we figured out once we had that key piece of the equipment, it set us up for the  relay cropping.  We could put fertilizer down with it.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:26):**  So we built that accordingly.  And that's the one that really sealed the deal that I got the job with going equipment  out of that deal.  It sounds like it's something I think about a lot.  How do you bridge the gap between practical, like what's actually happening on the farm?  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:40):**  What are the drivers?  What's going to make more money, save more time versus the people who are building the  technologies, whether it's equipment or digital technologies, like they sometimes don't speak  the same language.  What's your experience been with kind of bridging the gap between those two?  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:12:56):**  That's kind of my position with Dawn is to kind of help the engineers understand what's  actually going on in the field.  And I always go back to John Deere when through the years they had a history of hiring young  farm kids and bringing them up through the country.  And that's who they ended up as their designers in that.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:13):**  Well, they've kind of went away from that.  And about, I don't even remember what year that was, but I had the opportunity to go  to work for Deere and we were at a field day with a bunch of the lead engineers and they're  like, you don't want to come and work for us anymore.  Go to a company like Dawn that's more responsive.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:33):**  You can actually have an impact.  Joe as he's evolved the whole underground ag line that I've actually working for is  strongly focused on the regen ag side and stuff like that.  So it's pretty neat to see all this coming full circle.  And now we've got manufacturers starting to look at the way we're doing stuff and I'm  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:13:52):**  optimistic about the future, I guess, on some of that.  Yeah, it's really interesting.  I mean, in the world I often live in, we're talking about people with robotics expertise  and mechatronic engineers and machine learning programmers.  And we absolutely need that skill set, but we also need that skill set to appreciate  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:14:11):**  what's happening on the farm.  And I know I've been in lots of hilarious conversations where people are talking over  each other and I'm one of them, I'm sure, but it's totally different skill sets.  And yet we've got to find a way to meet in the middle somehow and kind of learn from  what each other brings.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:14:25):**  Well, we've hit a point in life where Google is our best friend, but I'm also seeing it  being some people's nemesis.  It's so easy to find information and people are afraid to seek that next level of information.  They just take the easy answer and go with it because Google says, well, I remember when  we first started getting on Google, it seemed it was a lot more, you could get better information  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:14:53):**  now.  Now it all seems filtered and they aim it towards more what your rest of your searches  are.  I kind of like going back to the old school, kind of the hard searches and let's look in  depth and as a high school graduate, it's pretty cool to be stuck.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:15:08):**  I found myself this past summer, spring and summer studying fluid dynamics and stuff like  that, trying to help figure out how some of the stuff we're engineering right now, how  to help make it work.  And well, that's kind of the fun part where I'm at right now.  It's one thing to have an ideal and build it for yourself, but to have that help develop  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:15:33):**  an ideal and see it come to production.  And I guess part of that, you mentioned a pivotal day in your career, kind of going  from closed loop to open frame, but that's part of this, right?  Is sharing these ideas with others so that they can get to more scale, I imagine.  Yeah.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:15:49):**  And I mean, I hate to keep going back to Rollin, but that was kind of that timeframe.  I was a very closed minded person.  I was building, I was going to farm the world at that time and everything was proprietary,  whatever you want to call it.  And soon as Rollin got sick, I realized that chances are the farm could die with me.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:16:10):**  And I just said, I'm not a selfish person.  I'm going to start sharing ideals.  And the next thing you know, when you start sharing ideals, more people share ideals with  you and it just snowballs from there.  And it's just neat to see where it's all taken us, you know, in the realm of what I would

We push each other at that point.  You know, that's kind of neat part where I see a bunch of us starting to go.  There's going to be some pretty cool things coming here, I'd say within the next year  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:16:46):**  now that a bunch of us are going to team up and help push a few things.  When you started thinking about sharing more, was it hard?  Like it's, it's, it strikes me that it's not easy to just change your mind and do something  different than you've always done.  Was that difficult?  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:17:04):**  No, it was, it was just natural because, you know, as I said, I spent eight weeks in the  hospital with my son.  You know, my wife came home to my daughters and I stayed in the hospital because we kind  of figured I'd be the one that pushed him, you know, to keep his mind going and all that  through the chemo and radiation and all that stuff.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:17:21):**  And, you know, we never spent a full day in the hospital or in the city.  We'd always, every day we'd just pick a direction and go just to keep his mind going.  And, you know, as I started seeing what was going on around that area, that's when I really  started you know, online, we had a presence online back then already with ag online or  successful from way back then it was successful farming and then new ag talk.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:17:46):**  And you know, I always said, that's when my, my world started expanding.  You know, I went from Fayette County, Iowa to North America.  And then as them websites transition, you know, we started going international on that.  You know, everybody asks me what's going on at home anymore.  I haven't a clue.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:18:04):**  You know, what's the thing I'm like, dad, I don't know.  You know, I can probably tell you more of what's going on in Australia, France, Germany,  or someplace like that than a kid in West Union, Iowa.  And I figured out that's a lot more relevant.  I don't get hooked on petty stuff.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:18:17):**  Like a lot of, a lot of people get hooked on the petty stuff and I just don't care anymore.  Yeah.  How's your son doing now?  Oh, it's, it's been a heck of a ride.  I mean the, the, it turned out long-term that the chemo and radiation, you know, the cancer  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:18:31):**  was in an easy battle about five years after the chemo and radiation.  And the worst part was anxiety setting.  As one of his therapists described, his friends just got sick of him being sick.  We've had to find different places, different facilities to get them in, get them the help.  And then, you know, through our healthcare system, there's been a few, few major hiccups  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:18:55):**  that have dropped the ball on him, but we keep fighting and we've got a great new young  therapist helping him out.  I mean, he's in a brain injury rehab place there in Oklahoma that, you know, they did  great the first year he was down there, especially with all the COVID crap.  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:19:13):**  That does not, um, yeah, it sounds like a really, really up and down, just, just the,  the rollercoaster of, of it all can't be easy.  I used to enjoy telling the whole Rollins story, but then when, uh, all hell broke loose,  I kind of got quiet about it for two years, but now we're back to a point where I can  freely talk about it.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:19:31):**  Cause you start seeing the progress again.  One of the things we were talking a little bit about this last week, but is agriculture  is, I mean, it's the fact that we're even having this conversation about, you know,  your family and what's happening and on a podcast about technology is just an insane  thing about agriculture, how it is about families and it is about life.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:19:52):**  And some of that stuff's just not talked about enough.  You know, we're like, Oh, what decision did you make on paddock seven?  And it's like, you're missing the bigger picture here of how this fits into humans and families.  And yeah, it's just, it's such a unique industry in that sense.  Well, that's, you know, people are shocked when I say I'm ready to walk away from the  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:20:10):**  management of farming and that, but since all that both daughters have made it known  that they want to be involved in the farm right now.  And, uh, I guess I might as well be Frank.  I don't enjoy the management option anymore.  It just that that's mundane.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:20:24):**  I like figuring out how to make things work and then let somebody else handle it.  You know, that that's part of what we're getting ready to look forward to in the future here,  how we can help help other people transition without offending.  You know, that's what I see a lot of people adamant right now.  It's this way or that way.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:20:41):**  Well, no, you've got to figure out where that person's comfortable with and help them push  the boundary a little at a time instead of, you know, too many people want wholesale changes  right now.  And, you know, prices are good right now, but I'm in the mindset right now.  I'm not over going to overextend to one bit.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:21:03):**  When you say transition there, do you mean to things like no-till or what do you mean  or just like generally kind of improvements or?  Well, no-till is a part of what we do.  You know, I don't, I don't even really focus on cover crops anymore.  You know, I call cover crops the gateway drug to what we're doing now with the relay cropping  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:21:22):**  and that because once you start understanding some of that and you actually see it and working  on your farm, I'm in the heart of the corn belt and I don't even care if I grow corn  anymore.  You know, everybody around here grows corn.  Well, I can't compete with that, but now we've figured out the relay crop in here and I can  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:21:42):**  run cash flows that would blow 250 bushels an acre corn away.  I could probably make the guy that wants to grow 300 corn feel pretty sad with some of  the cash flows we can run.  My main focus is the cereal rye and soybeans and then, you know, we're rotating out of  corn right now.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:22:00):**  Mother nature is probably going to make a liar out of me, but I'll probably keep some  corn in the rotation yet just because like this year, you know, I thought I have it,  everything set up perfectly, but then late May there we had a frost, May 29th, but we  ended up replanting a lot of beans and that's why I'm hoping that didn't screw my plan up.  But you know, the fluid management is the way I call it.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:22:19):**  You know, we'll have a kind of a destination where we're going, but how we get there, nobody  knows.  Right now I'm looking pretty hard.  You know, I can make the cash flow with the relay beans.  So we're rotating back and forth relay beans and regular beans.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:22:32):**  Some guys are going to say, oh, you can't do that.  But if you start seeing the soil health scores we can create with that system, it's working.  How do you think about making those decisions?  Is it sort of agronomically driven like you're saying around soil and what makes sense to  actually plan or is it more markets as in this is kind of where we want to be headed  
**[0:22:50-0:22:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:22:50):**  in terms of consumers or different markets or prices?  How do you think about the balance?  Right now, the main reason I'm pushing as hard as I am on the relay crop is because  I think we've got a window.  You know, we have it figured out on my farm.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:23:04):**  I know some neighbors are starting to do what we're doing, so I figure I've got a five-year  window before they catch up to me.  And I hope in the next five years I figure out something, the next best thing, I hate  to say it that way, but I don't want to get hooked in any one set pattern.  But right now, we've built the market for rye and as cover crop and that, and we've  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:23:24):**  got the reputation for quality seed and all that.  I know I can hammer pretty hard here in the next five years without much risk and much  stress.  See what the neighbors do in five years if they're catching up to me, then maybe by the  time they're not growing corn anymore, I'll go back to corn.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:23:44):**  The sad part is that late frost kind of ruined a lot of our test for this year.  We tend to push boundaries pretty hard.  Well, this year, one of the things we were trying to do is grow vegetables in between  corn.  So essentially, we want to start turning our cash crops into our cover crops into cash  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:24:00):**  crops.  You know, I think we had the perfect setup, but again, May 29th frost and then, you know,  some of the testing we were doing on that field, instead of using a herbicide, I burned  the field off trying to control perennials and that.  Well, we learned fire and ice is hard on perennial.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:24:19):**  I jokingly started calling that the blackjack plot.  Hit me one more time in 2021.  And Lauren doesn't just look at the soil health or the yields to know if his system is working.  He says the answer can also be found in the water.  The trout is one of the most pleasant surprises we had in the last year.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:24:39):**  I guess, you know, as I've been thinking about that since it's happened, I think it's age  starting to catch up to me a little bit.  You know, I used to condemn deer, turkey, rabbits and all that when I'd see them in  my field.  But as you start getting older, you start appreciating more of that.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:24:54):**  And we had a lot of hurdles back in June, July.  And Ross, the young guy that I worked with on the multi-cropping Iowa project, he called  me the one day and he said, hey, the DNR would like to come out and check your stream for  trout.  Cool I never thought of trout in our creek.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:11):**  You know, I knew that I knew we've had fish in it ever since growing up and that.  But it came out about a week or two before our field day and they started stunning the  trout so they could actually take inventory of what's there.  And here we have native trout in our creek about five miles away from where they probably  thought there should be trout.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:29):**  The only way you're going to have trout in a stream like that is you got cool, clear,  good quality water.  To me, that's the ultimate sign that what we're doing is working on our farm.  Like I said, you know, then part of our field day, we had the DNR out and do it again.  And then we had, well, the one night we had a bunch of kids out here, we showed them all  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:25:48):**  the trout in the stream and all that.  If this keeps progressing, you know, they're monitoring our creek now, they're going to  actually stock our creek with another species of native trout to try to help propagate the  trout herd in Northeast Iowa.  So I said you can run all the tests you want.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:07):**  But when you start, when you see something like that happen, you know, a couple of days,  one of one of the days of our field day this year, we had the Rodale Institute here.  And by two, three days later, I got a letter from the head of Rodale Institute saying,  I've been struggling to put a name on the definition on regen agriculture.  He's like, but I think when I can stand in your creek and see trout where they're not  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:32):**  supposed to be, that's a pretty good sign.  And you know, that's some little things I see in the future, you know, John Q. Public  is paying attention to what we're doing.  And that's the stories we've got to start telling.  We as farmers got to step forward and tell what we're doing on the farm.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:26:48):**  And, you know, start showing the positive light, not just letting people grab the negative  light and showcasing that.  Yeah, what do you think about that?  Is that a driver for you in terms of talking to the public and telling the stories?  I mean, in one sense, I find that really compelling.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:27:03):**  Like there are amazing stories and people care about nature and the environmental aspects.  In another sense, it's like, that's exhausting.  Like you're already farming, you're running that business, having to have that conversation.  And then I guess the third one is like, soon we'll have satellite imagery that is just  knowing everything we want to know and the brands or whoever else is going to communicate  
**[0:27:21-0:27:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:27:21):**  about it.  So I don't know, do you see that long term as the role of the farmer?  I think we need to become self advocates before we start getting dictated what we're going  to do on the farm.  I foresee, you know, everybody's hooked on the carbon credits.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:27:37):**  But the first thing I tell people is, you know, number one, we better be carbon or I'm  a proponent of the net zero initiative, I guess I'll put it that way.  Because what I'm worried is we as farmers are going to step forward and sell all our  carbon credits when we're not even truly carbon neutral in the first place.  So if United States steps forward and follows the Canadian model, we switch to a carbon  
**[0:28:00-0:28:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:00):**  tax, what's going to happen to your average farmer that sold all those carbon credits?  So I was asked to be on a net zero alliance initiative or whatever they want to call it  for the local community college.  And that's really helped me start understanding where things are going.  And you know, if you start really talking to the people in industry, I think your major  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:24):**  players are going to start looking at the net zero alliance.  And that's, I believe, and I volunteered our farm to run an audit to find out exactly where  we're at on the net zero initiative.  You know, because right now, you know, everybody's touting, oh, we're going carbon neutral.  I don't think any of them ever even realized what that's going to take to truly quantify  
**[0:28:45-0:28:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:45):**  that.  On our personal operation, I want to get to the point where I'm not going to be afraid  to say, hey, do I use a pen or a pencil?  That sounds a little extreme, but I think to truly tell a story, that's where we're  going to need to be.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:28:59):**  What do you mean?  Well, with the whole net zero, I mean, you know, I want to be able to say, hey, you know,  we are actually, you know, my goal is to actually prove we're positive.  I don't even know where we're going to be yet on that.  So that's probably a bold statement, but you know, that's part of the reason I want to  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:17):**  do the relay crop for at least five years, because I think we can set a pretty strong  baseline.  You know, probably our biggest carbon burn right now is the nitrogen use on corn.  You know, so if I can truly eliminate that, that's going to help us drastically right  there.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:33):**  And, you know, focusing on crops that we don't need the nitrogen and stuff like that, or  through some of our past testing with the clovers and stuff like that in our corn, you  know, we've actually proved that we can produce 80 pounds of nitrogen in a corn on corn situation.  Even in a rotated field, we can do that now.  You know, I was told this summer that, you know, a little bit of a head of soybeans is  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:29:56):**  not a good idea, but we've done it.  You know, we've maintained a lagoon crop since 2016 till last fall.  Last fall, that field was going to be set up for relay again.  So I finally felt comfortable taking that field out.  But you know, I also know that's one of the fields that we are testing hardest on carbon,  
**[0:30:14-0:30:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:14):**  and we can probably blow some pretty good numbers.  You know, we're going to have some pretty strong numbers coming off of that field already.  So for me, the key is start keeping that living plan in there 24 seven in northeast Iowa.  That takes a little thinking because in the what we kind of have a winner.  And we freeze up in December and we probably the last couple years we haven't fought till  
**[0:30:36-0:30:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:36):**  April.  But some of the data I'm reading and hearing shows that even if we have a like a perennial  cover in there, as long as it's green, even under snow cover, it's probably sinking some  carbon.  We had one of the major companies here a couple months ago have supper with the COO.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:30:54):**  And she's like, Lauren, when I go back to the board Monday morning, what do you want  me to tell the board?  I said, why don't you go back and tell them we screwed up?  She looked at me and she's like, what do you mean?  I was like, well, the way I look at it, you guys have spent a lot of money trying to quantify  
**[0:31:09-0:31:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:09):**  carbon.  I can spend $8 on a water quality sample and prove that we're doing a good job.  Now if we solve the water issue, we solve the carbon issue at the same, you know, they  go hand in hand.  So if we solve the cycle, we solve the carbon cycle and you know, that's probably getting  
**[0:31:27-0:31:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:27):**  way beyond where you wanted to go today.  But that's  No, no, it's fascinating.  I mean, I think that kind of those kind of indirect indicators, like right now we're  stuck in this world, especially around carbon of like, we've got to go out and measure every

And it's like, that just doesn't make sense.  Right.  And it's not going to scale.  Like we've got changes to make way faster than we can figure out how to scale digging  
**[0:31:49-0:31:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:49):**  cores.  Yeah.  It does.  From what I've been reading here, and it all comes down to water quality.  If you've got water, you've got carbon in the soil.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:31:59):**  You know, that's, you know, we were fortunate enough back in July here at the field day,  Rick, Dr. Rick Haney was here, and he kind of showed us his new test coming.  It's going to be fun times.  And you know, that that's part of that technology we were talking about the other day.  I mean, that's, that's why guys involved in some of this, you know, I know a few people  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:20):**  condemn me for being so pro technology, but the way I look at it, if we can start doing  things with technology that we can't do today, what's wrong with that?  Yeah, last fall, we were seeding cover crops in standing corn with robots.  We've used the drones for spraying.  We've used all my relay rye this year was all maintained with the drone.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:43):**  And we can get cost competitive already with a plane.  You know, ground rig is still cheaper.  Yes.  And when you have solid crop out there, I don't want to sacrifice crop.  So the drone fit is the perfect fit.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:32:58):**  And you know, it just helps us maintain quality.  I'm sure we've got some listeners who want your list of what you've been using any companies  you'd recommend or any tools that you've been using that people should check out if they  want to think about going down some of these paths.  Oh, man.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:33:16):**  We have the robot, ROWBOT was the one we had last fall there seeding.  And then this year, we have Sibanto out here.  That's another company that they're making autonomous, you know, traditional tractors  autonomous, I guess would be the description there.  IZO is the company that we're working with on the drones.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:33:37):**  Through the whole Ag Launch 365 deal, we've been exposed to quite a few companies that,  you know, global neighbor, I'm gonna say is the one to watch right now.  I think they've got some technology that's going to be a game changer.  You know, we're supposed to have it on our combine this fall that they they've got the  weed destructor like you would have in Australia, but instead of a mill there, you're actually  
**[0:34:02-0:34:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:02):**  using a light source technology.  So it takes a lot less power.  It works in a broader range of environments.  You know, in Iowa here, we're pretty high humidity compared to Australia.  You know, so that was been my biggest concern, like with the Hanraville type deals on the  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:17):**  back of the combine, it creates a lot of heat, you know, the more humidity have, the worse  it's going to work.  But the neat part to that technology is there, they already have a commercial version called  the weed erase that a homeowner can buy.  And you use that same light source technology to kill weeds.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:34:36):**  They're in field test right now they're gonna, they're gonna come out with a field version  that in lab they were killing cereal, foot tall cereal rye at four mile an hour.  So if we can start utilizing that technology, and if you really get the chance to talk to  him, he starts describing how beyond killing weeds, they can suppress leads.  So they just turn back the dial and say, Hey, we want to suppress like clover for a month  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:03):**  or clover for two months.  They just turn the dial back, stun that clover.  Boom, you got cover crop that's perennial.  And you know, cover crop every year, you can just keep maintaining that, you know, that's,  that's what we've been trying, but I've killed a lot of good cover crop trying to learn.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:21):**  Then the other thing, like in the fall after harvest, you'd be able to use that same technology,  go over your field and it would germinate the weed seeds that are on top.  So it's like, all of a sudden you've got a three season tool, that's how you make stuff  pay.  I talked about, you know, once we figured out how to build stuff that you can use more  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:41):**  than one season, you know, one of the, one of the things I've got accused, you know,  they're like, well, for no more acres, new farm, how do you justify the equipment you  have?  Well, we use more than one season a year.  You know, you make it so it's adaptable, you simple, you know, like my drill, I just changed  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:35:57):**  monitor and boom, I can go from fertilizer to seeding to, you know, broadcast or whatever  you want to do.  We, we, with minor changes, we can do pretty, you know, that, that tool, well, when I was  at 750 acres, that tool was going over 3000 acres a year and no customer.  So you know, it, it, it gets some serious acres on it, even though we don't have the  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:17):**  farm, but you know, I, I've also got to the point where I don't want to farm the world.  So, you know, if I can do a better job, what we're doing, that's where I'm at.  And, and keeping it fun, it sounds like as well, which, which is increasingly, I mean,  must be super exciting to have your daughters thinking about coming back and taking over  that, that must be, you must be really proud.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:37):**  The biggest challenge there is going to be, you know, the, the son-in-law, they farm very  sizable acres, I guess I'll put it that way.  If we can have a little impact, you know, I'm not going to try to tell them guys how  to farm, you know, and I've told them, you know, his parents need to know I'm never going  to condemn how they farm because I respect what they've done.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:36:58):**  You know, his dad's the same age as I am.  We were good friends growing up and all that.  I don't want it ever come off that I'm condemning the way they farm, but you know, I know his  mother's paying attention.  We're doing, cause you know, they, they see the bills and you know, we're, we're farming  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/9/8/getting-off-the-commodities-treadmill#t=0:37:16):**  a fraction of what they're farming and a lot less stress, you know, but if, if we can have  an impact and help them understand how we farm and take it to that scale, that could  be, you know, I could set them kids up for a pretty good future.  And that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.  A huge thanks to Lauren for chatting with me and to Connie Bowen for suggesting Lauren
